3117	ortho-tri-cyclen	1	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	birth prevention	Although this type of birth control has more cons than pros, it did help with my cramps. It's also effective with the prevention of pregnancy. (Along with use of condoms as well)	Heavy Cycle, Cramps, Hot Flashes, Fatigue, Long Lasting Cycles. It's only been 5 1/2 months, but i'm concidering changing to a different bc. This is my first time using any kind of bc, unfortunately due to the constant hassel, i'm not happy with the results.	I Hate This Birth Control, I Would Not Suggest This To Anyone.
1146	ponstel	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	menstrual cramps	I was used to having cramps so badly that they would leave me balled up in bed for at least 2 days.  The Ponstel doesn't take the pain away completely, but takes the edge off so much that normal activities were possible. Definitely a miracle medication!!	Heavier bleeding and clotting than normal.	I took 2 pills at the onset of my menstrual cramps and then every 8-12 hours took 1 pill as needed for about 3-4 days until cramps were over. If cramps are bad, make sure to take every 8 hours on the dot because the medication stops working suddenly and unfortunately takes about an hour to an hour and a half to kick back in.. if cramps are only moderate, taking every 12 hours is okay.
3947	prilosec	3	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	acid reflux	"The acid reflux went away for a few months after just a few days of being on the drug. The heartburn started again as soon as I stopped taking it. So I began treatment again. 6 months passed and I stopped taking it. The heartburn came back, and seemed worse even. The doctor said I should try another 6 month treatment. I did, and the same exact thing happened. This went on for about three years. I asked why this wasn't curing my reflux. The doctor quite frankly told me that it wasn't a cure, but a ""treatment for the symptoms"". I was told that I would probably be on it for the rest of my life."	Constipation, dry mouth and some mild dizziness that would go away after medication was stopped for a few days.	I was given Prilosec prescription at a dose of 45mg per day. Medication was taken once, every morning before eating. Each treatment duration was for 6 months.
1951	lyrica	2	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	fibromyalgia	I think that the Lyrica was starting to help with the pain, but the side-effects were just too severe to continue.	I felt extremely drugged and dopey.  Could not drive at all while on this med.  Also had extreme ankle and feet swelling and couldn't even wear shoes.	See above
2372	propecia	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	hair loss	after taking propecia for over a year, starting when i was 20 years of age my hair continued to thin, and i noticed no significant benefits	"Low sex drive, before i started taking this drug i was 19 years of age and full of ""enthousiasm"". Now engaged and 21 years old, my sex drive is very low, my wife and I are very unsatisfied. I am also very tired even during peak hours throughout the day, and its hard to concentrate on mundain tasks"	one pill once daily
1043	vyvanse	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	add	My mood has noticably improved, I have more energy, experience better sleep and digestion.	a few experiences of nausiea, heavy moodswings on the days I do not take it, decreased appetite, and some negative affect on my short-term memory.	I had began taking 20mg of Vyvanse for three months and was surprised to find that such a small dose affected my mood so effectively.  When it came to school work though I found that I needed the 30mg to increase my level of focus (and have been on it for a month since).  I had not experienced decreased appetite until about a month into taking the 20mg.  I find that the greatest benefit of Vyvanse for me is that it tends to stabalize my mood on a daily basis and lessens any bouts of anxiety and depression that i used to face before I was perscribed.
2715	elavil	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	Although this drug was originally prescribed for depression, it helped with sleeplessness. Therefore, I have continued to take it for that alone. While I still on occasion have problems falling asleep, I find I can combine it with Melatonin or Valerian. In 12 years, I haven't had to increase the elavil dosage.	None.	One a day, taken about an hour before bedtime.
1591	xanax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	panic disorder	This simply just works fast and without any of the nasty side effects of SSRI medicines. I won't go into a long story of my panic attacks which I sought help for many years after the fact. This just works and it does what it's supposed to without any annoying side effects. When taken daily, it has stopped my panic attacks from starting and thinking patterns that lead to them. I find it can also be used as needed along with the daily treatment.	I really don't have any side effects other than the mild but very tolerable issue of taking it 4-5 times a day which isn't an effect but just the way you need to take this. At first, within the first 1 day then couple of weeks after starting, this medicine is broken down by your body fast and you need to adjust your dose. Once I got past the ups and downs of the first week or two of getting this increased from .25 mg - 3 times per day to what I'm on now things are so stable and just smooth.	I first started taking this at 3 times per day with .25 mg pills. I was advised not to take as needed with my panic attacks as that would reinforce the idea of taking a pill when it's needed and not help me work around my anxiety. This is totally true. At first I wished to only take them as needed but with my doctor's advice, he was right. This really does work when you take it daily at 3-5 times per day. This way your body adjusts to what's going on with the panic and makes no association with taking a pill to prevent or stop it, they just don't start in the first place. Yes, I still do have minor attacks and worry episodes here and there but nothing at all like the many years before this. I wish that this extremely helpful medicine would not have such a bad name in media, news and pharmacies. This works wonders and there is no want or need to take more or become and addict. People and doctor's need to  understand more on how to treat someone with something that just WORKS, rather than trying to give them SSRI's which are what the drugs companies push, all for money reasons. And, the doctor's out there who decide that SSRI's are the only option, they need to go back to medical school!
1686	claritin	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	allergies	none - did nothing to help allergies. i just had a dryer, more painful version of my allergies with new allergies/irritations developing on top of my original ones. this stuff is dangerous and the side effects that many people are experiencing are not listed on the package. a class action lawsuit needs to happen.	I had some horrifying mental and physical side effects. ruined a year of my life.  read this - it mentions everything i dealt with: http://www.askapatient.com/viewrating.asp?drug=19658&name=CLARITIN	took one 10 mg pill nightly.
458	flagyl	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bacterial vaginosis	I experienced complete clearing of the Vaginosis after the regimin was completed.	I did get a mild yeast infection during treatment.	I took the antibiotic as prescribed every day, twice a day, one pill each time. My Bacterial Vaginosis cleared up after treatment. However, I did have a slight yeast infection that went away with an OTC treatment.
3479	dextroamphetamine	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	add	"Smoother more gradual onset and effect than Adderall. Effective at controlling ADD symptoms previously controlled by Adderall however this drug seems more natural and transparent. Less tension and anxiety. Less ""druggy"" unnatural feelings and thoughts."	Dexerine IR tablets need to be taken more often than adderall and also wear off more abruptly. Generic tablets are not high quality and somewhat expensive due to the need for a large quantity of tablets.	Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine to compare the effects. Dexedrine is simply dextroamphetamine while Adderall is a mixture of Amphetamine salts. This might explain the increased effectiveness of the Dexedrine contrary to popular belief. I found it important to take several relatively low doses frequently to achieve a balanced effect.
959	sarafem	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I found that this drug helps significantly with my level of depression and monthly irritability that occurs around my menstrual cycles.	My sides effects were not noticeable and very mild.  I have noticed some lower libido while on Fluoxetine, but no other noticeable side effects.	This was prescribes to me for treatment for depression, seasonable disorder and hormonal irritability.   I have gone off this medication while pregnant, but have resumed to help ease depression issues.
928	latisse	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	sparse eyelashes	"For the first time in my life I had enough lashes to apply mascara to.  I had tried eyelash extensions which only broke off or pulled out what few thin lashes I did have.  Strip lashes were itchy and uncomfortable.  I now have normal lashes.
Even though I only applied it to upper lashes the lower lashes have grown longer and thicker too."	My upper eyelids were red and itchy for the first 4-5 weeks but that went away and I have not had a problem since.  My eye exams have been normal with eye preassure normal.	For the first 6-8 weeks I used one drop every night applied to upper lash base with a small disposable brush.  After my lashes had grown in I started using it every 2-3 nights instead of every night and the lashes have stayed longer and thicker than prior to treating them.
2643	aldara	4	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	skin cancer	Aldara did seem to crust up my previous skin cancer area and help minimize my scar from MOHS surgery for skin cancer. Due to the side effects I could only tolerate for one week opposed to 6 week regiman.	I felt an out of it feeling, like a depressed feeling, I was fatigued and I broke out with severe blisters on and around my lips.	I used 1/4 of a packet(5% cream) on just my nose every other night and on alternating nights I put on an entire packet on my entire face.
3692	effexor-xr	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	reduction in anxiety, no panic attacks.  drug is extremely effective	no side effects while on drug.  Super bad side effects while going off the drug.  Google searched it.  Lots of people with the same symptoms.  read up before you start it.	took medication for 5 to 6 years.  Very hard to get off this drug.  I liked the way my anxiety was controlled, but it also inhibits all emotional response (at least in my case).  I didn't have any mood, emotion, nothing.  It gave me a very flat affect.  Also my doctor did not seem very informed toward drug side effects and withdrawl symptomologies.
338	neurontin	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	nerve disorder	"I'm taking Gabapentin to treat nerve disorder. My nerves are inflamed and causes to experience pelvic pain and other pelvic disorders. The Gabapentin sometimes works but I do experience relapse.

For the migraines
I find that the 800mg of Ibprofen works better with no side effect for my migraines, but the maxalt has a better track record."	"I have no side effect while taking Gabapentin but if I miss a couple of dosages or run out and wait for my next refill, I have moderate withdrawal syptoms. These syptoms include itchness, irrability, moodness, axiousness, and headaches.

Maxalt side effect for  me is throat feels contristricted shortly after taking medicine."	I take 600mg of Gabapentin three times day. It seems to be effective but I feel I need a hire dosage as the longer I take it the more I experience relapses.I first started out with 300mg three times a day but it was ineffective.
3201	omnicef	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	sore throat ear infections	don't know yet back to pediatrician today	My one year old daughter who has an awesome disposition (and always has) became restless and agitated. Very touchy, aggressive, crying a lot, and having a hard time sleeping. Also refluxing a lot and not nursing normally. It just dawned on me this morning it must be the medication. Will request another antibiotic today from the pediatrician.	Thanks
2566	klonopin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	generalized anxiety disorder	Very good at relieving anxiety.  Good at generally calming me down and 'leveling me out' to make functioning easier.  Helps a little to relax muscle tension.  Calming effect makes an excellent sleep aid.	Fatigue can sometimes be excessive.  High dependency.	Used for general anxiety and as an adjunct for depression and chronic pain.  Very good at alleviating any anxiety and jittery feelings.  'Levels out' my mood but doesn't cause euphoria; I have no desire to take more than I need.  However I am very dependent on it; if I stop taking it for a couple of days I have bad nervousness and jitteryness, tachycardia, sweating, and other anxiety symptoms.  If I wanted to discontinue I would have to do _very_ slowly, but this is the nature of long-term benzodiazepine treatment.
723	dovonex	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	psoriasis	Controlled the psoriasis, however did not reduce its presence.	"a ""halo"" a few shades lighter than the natural skin tone was present around the site of application, which would last about 12-24 hours."	"I found this time-consuming to apply 1-2 times daily.  Also, due to the ""halo"" effect, it was a little precarious to apply as well."
305	protopic	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	ezcema	cure the ezcema and it took aout teh roughest of the skin	"skin redness and flushes, sometimes the skin eels like it is on fire, and you feel very ho.
It is also very itchy when the skin is heeling because of the drug, sometimes you even wake up in the middle of the night because of the itchiness. But this only happens the first few days, when the skins is very bad with ezcema, after a few days, when the skin is better you don't feel you have put any treatment in the skin, and it feels as any othe normal moisturiser cream"	to apply once a day afeter cleaning the skin, and avoid direct sunlight
1084	effexor	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	panic attacks and depression	reduction of panic attacks and depression to almost nil	nausea for first two weeks then no perceived ill effects	started on a low dose (25mg) and built up to 150mg over 3 months which was reduced to 75mg per day after six months. This dose continues today. A six month treatment break resulted in a return of the symptoms so treatment was resumed at 25mg up to 75mg after one month.
1246	sotret	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	I took isotretinoin for persistent adult acne.  My skin was not by any means awful, but I did have evident pimples on my forehead and chin, and awful, awful blackheads on my nose that despite daily steaming and extraction, were terrible.  The drug totally cleared up my face, and my blackhead literally dried up in front of my eyes.  My once horribly oily skin changed to almost normal.	First, let me say that I didn't experience the awful side effects that some do with isotretinoin use.  I did turn very, very red around the perioral area and especially at the nasolabial folds.  My face felt as if I needed to peel it off and scratch deep down in the dermis.  In fact, that was my main complaint--the itchiness . . . and of course the dryness.  But the dryness was not nearly as bad as I expected.  For example, my lips never cracked.  However, I'm several years out from treatment , and I still have dry skin problems.  It's weird because my skin was always so oily and now it's dry.  But that could be attributed to normal aging.  Regardless, I've become a real connosiour of facial moisturizers.  My skin is also a little more sensitive post isotretinoin.  Tazorac one percent, which I used to slather on nightly like lotion, now sets me on fire if I dare to use the half percent version more than twice a week.  I know the literature claims there's no anti-aging efficacy if it isn't used daily, but I'm hoping for the best.	"I have to confess that I'm confused by this section.  There were no real ""details"" associated with my treatment aside from what I've alreay described."
1714	retin-a-micro	8	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anti-aging, acne	The treatment benefits included Skin Regeneration, and decreased Acne.  My skin felt more smooth and the pigmentation was disapearing.  Overall, the goals were accomplished however the redness of the skin took over.	The side effects of the treatment included Redness, Dryness, Skin Irritation.  The skin was very dry and difficult to moisturize.  The skin looked red and irritated.   However, when I switched to a lighter skin cleanser, Cetaphil, this really helped improve the redness and dryness.  Prior to the Cetaphil i was using Roc cleansing pads which were too harsh on my skin.	My routine included Daily use of Micro Retin A pump.  I applied the Retin A Micro pump to my entire face at night after washing my face.  I used a moisturizer and sun screen in the morning.
376	lamotrigine	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	epilpsy	fits settled down to maybe 1 a fortnight which were daily before this medication	has gained quite abit of weight but as he has had problems gaining weight since being a toddler this isnt a bad thing	givn by specialist after previous medicine epilim caused serious side effects still messing with dosage in the hope of getting his fits down to 0 but so far a vast improvement in seizures

2436	symbicort	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	asthma, emphysema	I had taken Pulmicort, and other inhalants, with no major changes.  It became more difficult to maintain my exercise and lively life style. I gave in and began Symbicort and immediately experienced a relief of shortness of breath, weezing.  I feel like a new person. I still have a reaction to cold wind, and very high humidity, but so much better.  I rarely use my Albuterol.	none	I take one puff in the am, rinse my mouth and gargle.  I repeat the treatment in the evening before bed.
3716	lamictal	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar disorder and depression	I'm feeling more grounded; highs and lows are less extreme.  You could say that my emotional 'playing field' is more level.	"There's one 'side effect' - and I'm purposely and playfully/sarcastically placing it within quotes:  this stuff has increased my sex-drive manyfold! I don't know if this has been the case with other patients, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has had that experience.
I'm also presenting with a little 'feathery tickle', resulting in an annoying dry cough; perhaps this side effect will lessen as my body adapts to the medication."	"My doctor started me on a minimal dose (25 mg) of Lamotrigine, and this will be prior to starting Interferon/Ribavarin treatment for the Hep-C I've got.  (An antidepressant may be added in the near future as well.) Lamotrigine was prescribed to put me in a calmer state of mind, specifically because of the high anxiety effect I receive from antidepressants, which resulted in 2 visits to an emergency room - as well as a one month hospital stay due to extreme anxiety and paranoia.
So far/so good is this layman's analysis."
1959	lyrica	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	fibromyalgia, failed back syndrome	It seemed to work at first, but then the side effects started. Fatigue, severe memory loss, poor decisions, urinary incontinence, personality changes (crabby, irritable, withdrawn). The hard part is I can't seem to get off this stuff!! The withdrawals are horrible, shakiness, feelings of doom, loss of appetite, nausea, palpitations. It scares me so much that I just start taking it again. I'm stuck!! Don't ever start this stuff, there is something wrong with it. I don't know if I will ever be myself again.	see above	Lyrica 150mg twice a day
1872	doxycycline	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	decrease in acne pustules	photosensitivity	Take medication twice a day in combination with good skin care
1038	vyvanse	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	adhd	Alert, awake, focused	dry mouth, decreased appetite	I have only been on Vyvanse for 2 weeks.  I started at 40 mg. and now at 60 mg. until next week where I will probably be upped to 70 mg.  I used to take Focalin and then found out I was bipolar so had to stop that for close to a year to become stable on lithium.  I feel alert, awake and focused and feel Vyvanse is very smooth and lasts longer.  Hope I get the weight loss benefits eventually.
2745	actonel	7	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	osteoporosis	My  bone density's results have always been stable and I was told to continue with the drug.	leg cramps during the night.	"Eight years ago I started with Fosamax for 3-4 years and then took Actonel.
In March, I decided not to take Actonel any longer.   I had been on it for too long and was fearful of esophageal cancer and bone breakage.  Now my doctor wants me to take the Prolia injections, which I am not going to do. I am not going to continue with any drugs.   My bone density recently done was in the minuses.  I do work with a personal trainer and execise daily.  I am searching for alternative ways to deal with this problem."
1268	provigil	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	fatigue	I was more alert during the first part of the day but I found that it wore off by the afternoon. I could focus clearly, and if I needed a boost during the day another dose was enough.	It may cause some nervousness or restlessness. Sometimes I felt like I had drank a large cup of coffee during its full potency.	"I took modafinil for cronic fatigue and general drousiness. I found it to be moderatly effective. 

In the morning after I would take a dose the effects were noticeble and even pronounced, however after about lunchtime it totally wore off and I would have to take another dose, but if the second pill is taken later in the day it sometimes would interfere with sleep so one must be carful to take the pill at the right time."
797	ambien	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	Sleeping 7-8 hours without hangover	Memory loss	It is a GODSEND. Fully rested in the am and feel like a new person. I am convinced it has kept me from sliding into a full depression. It works on 3 levels for me: 1. My body gets rest so I can 'fight' for another day. 2. My brain heals. 3. I can endure a difficult day knowing I can take the pill and go to sleep. I consider it a miracle cure for preventing a full blown depression. Wish I had it available to me years ago...could have changed my life. I would recommend to anyone in for a good experience while getting to sleep!
2801	wellbutrin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"I have taken antidepressants for many years, and this is first that did not ""flip the switch"" on sexuality.  I no longer feel like I am looking out of a dark room.  I have more energy, feel more motivated, and overall function at a higher level than before."	"A little bit of ""hyper"" feelings.  I take the entire dose at one time, daily, and have been advised that the feeling of being revved up would disspiate if I did take it in two or more doses during the day.  I try to minimize the effect by taking the medication first thing in the morning."	I suffer chronic depression and the Wellbutrin is the first antidepressant that did not sedate me, and the only that did not dampen sexual feelings.  I have taken tricyclics (sp?) which were extremely sedating as well as limiting as far as OTC medications and dietary restrictions.  I have also tried SSRIs (prozac, zoloft, etc.)and while they temporarily relieved my depression, 1) the effect did not last more than 6 months, and 2) they completely destroyed my libido.
2360	propecia	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	male pattern baldness	Ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. So far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. I expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as I had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. In other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. So far, this has not occurred. The product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so I really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. In terms of halting the process, however, I must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning, so it's possible the drug is having an effect already. I will post a fuller report in another forty-seven months, I suppose.	I was surprised to experience brief blinding headaches in the upper left rear quadrant of my head, like a mini seconds-long burst of pressure that felt like a blunt object suddenly trying to explode out of my skull. This pressure would subside and I would go about my day. I'm told headaches are not one of the usual side-effects, so it may be an unrelated fluke. However, I've never had such an experience before, and it only manifested within about forty-eight hours of my first taking the drug and for seventy-two hours thereafter. The sudden and sporadic bursts of acute pain subsided, however, but I would caution anyone taking this drug for the first time to be on the lookout, especially if driving or in a public place with bright lights and a lot of noise around.	Overall, whether I am having some sort of placebo-effect reaction or not, my subjective impression is that hair loss has slowed or stopped and that the hair remaining appears fuller. I presented my symptoms to the doctor and she issued a prescription that same day, which I filled that afternoon at a local pharmacy and began taking immediately. The formulation I was prescribed was 1 milligram, although I believe the usual prescription is for 2 milligrams and can go as high as 5 milligrams. My case was mild to begin with, so it may be difficult to judge results. However, other than the mild side-effects I described above, which subsided within three days, I must say overall that my experience has been a positive one.
630	nortriptyline	3	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	a typical migraines	I have A-typical migraines which gives me weird sensation in my ears such as roaring and the sense that they are vibrating.  I also do have headacheds that seem to come from ears and the back of my neck.  It help me feel better and started to decrease my symptoms but side effects were worse than original symptoms.  It helped me to ignore my symptoms and helped me to get through the day.	ringing in the ears, sensitivity to noise, phantom noise in head, which all lead to anxiety	stopped medicine, looking for something else to help.
422	imitrex	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine headaches	migraine headache would stop	dizzy, palpitations	I have taken both the shots and the pills (separately) and they both worked well.  I would need to take the pills before getting sick to stomach, because if after, I could not keep pills down.  The shot worked regardless of when I took it.
330	ativan	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	Assists with getting to sleep and due to longer half life than other anxiolytics(ie Alprazolam)anxiety is less upon waking. Whilst Alprazolam is extrememly effective for immediate reduction in arousal, I find Lorazepam more effective for overall lowering of anxiety.It has been especially helpful to start the day with little or no anxiety rather than with a high arousal level immediately needing management or medication.	"As with all Benzodiazepines withdrawl is very noticeable if undertaken quickly. Lightheadedness, anxiety, dizzy spells, general feeling unwell.
In my experience the suggested half life in relation to reducing intake of these drugs is very misleading. Reduction for me has to be done very slowly over a number of weeks not days as usually suggested by physicians."	Taken for anxiety,initially in an acute stage. This was followed by a decision by patient (myself) to continue for 3 months in order to reduce arousal levels whilst undertaking therapy using the theraputic model ACT.
1899	doxycycline	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	severe peridontal disease	I had   persistent periodontal problems, both stressful and painful.  Every dentist I saw  told me I was going to lose my teeth.  This drug  cleared up the condition.  It protected me against inflammation for the entire period of time that I took it.  I continued taking the drug much longer than is usually recommended because it was so effective. The effectiveness did not seem to diminish.	None.	A dentist in my dental HMO prescribed it and was willing to continue to do so because I implored him to do so.

3060	oxycodone	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	possible lymphoma/kidney pain	The drug was pretty good for pain. They had me on morphine, which was horrible. The pain was preferable to the crazy dreams and paranoia I had. They then tried oxycontin, which was the best pain drug they gave me, but too addictive... so they moved me to vicodin products, which worked pretty well, with surprisingly few side effects.	Sleepiness, dizziness, light-headedness & nausea. I only took them when the pain was unbearable, so I might have gotten used to the side effects if I had kept the levels up in my system.	I just took the pills every 4-6 hours when the kidney pain was too bad. I tried to only take them at night as the conditions improved since they made me sleep. I stopped takeing them long before the infections and colon problems were resolved, as I don't like takeing drugs.
3728	lamictal	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	seizure disorder	Effective at controlling seizures without dizziness	There were no side effects	I took Dilantin for decades.  My doctor moved me to Trileptal; it was not 100% effective and caused dizziness, plus it was very expensive.  Lamictal controls my seizures, although I still get headaches (auras).  I would like to be completely free of these headaches, but this is still better than previous medications.

714	accutane	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Eventually Cleared my moderate acne. Had recieved antibiotics etc previosly which reduced it from severe to moderate, but then accutane completely cleared my skin after 5 months	Hair loss! Not so much from my head, but other places such as arms etc. Dry lips were the worst, tried many different products but eventually carmex solved that. Dry skin slightly, not too much of a probelem. Depression was bad, would have no motivation to do anything and hated everything around me. After stopping the drug this discontinued and i deem it acceptable to have, for the results of clear skin.	I can't remember ever having the initial flare ups/breakouts other people have reported. I was warned about this by my dermatologist but i can't say i remember it. I noticed no difference in the first few months and became very frustrated at this. It was only towards the end of the fourth month that it started to become noticablly clearer with only a few spots. By the end of the fifth month i was clear, and remained clear for a year. However the oilyness of my skin has returned and i would now class my skin as having mild acne, but it only affects the areas around my nose, unlike before where i had it all over my cheeks. If you notice any spots return, contact your derm to be put on a second course of accutane as i am, otherwise it can return more serverly and undo all the progress you have previously made.

2646	aldara	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	basal cell carcinoma	The cream made the basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratoses react, scab up, and heal to nice smooth skin after about two weeks after treatment with the cream ended.	I had no side effects.  Some people think the ulcerated scabby areas are side effects, but this is what the cream is designed to do, make bad cells react and destruct.	The cream is applied at bedtime for five nights a week for Basal Cell Carcinoma.  Three night per week for actinic keratosis.  You do this for eight weeks in a row.  By the end of eight weeks, the bad cells react gradually as scabby spots.  This is how you know the medicine is working.  You put the cream on the spots your doctor tells you to, with about an inch margin all around it.

I have been taking Tetracycline for over 2 years without no result, frustrated, my doctor prescribed Minocyline. After 1 year, I was still having break out just not as bad.	The treatment had no side effect on me.	I don't have severe acne problem, just occasional break out.  I was prescribed Minocycline by my doctor and was advised to take it once a day for treatment of my acne.  I was told that it would take up to six month to see result.  After more than a year being on it, it did very little for me.  I was still breaking out, it just that some of my break out was not as bad.  Bottom line, I was not satisfied because it did not help clear up my acne altogether.

But Then the following week I gained 8 pounds, so I stopped taking it. Its been 2 months now since I have taken one and I've lost an additional 19 pounds since I have stopped. 
I notice that I will usually gain a pound or two and the following week loose 4 or 5. Sometimes I'll have 2 weeks of no weight lose followed by a week of pretty dramatic weight lose.
I would never have been able to lose the weight without using Meridia to start off. I don't know if my stomach has shrunk or if I just have a better idea of how much to eat and what to do to lose weight, regardless I'm thrilled and couldn't be happier with the results!"

985	tekturna	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypertension	Very well managed blood pressure within normal, healthy range.  I had an allergic reaction to a more common blood pressure medication, Lisinopril (which is a combination of a thiazide diuretic and an ACE inhibitor).  The newer Tekturna has worked perfectly for me with only the slightest dizziness when I rose too quickly early on, but no side effects at all after the first few weeks.	I had a very slight issue, early on in treatment (in the first few weeks only), of slight dizziness when rising quickly from either laying down or from bending over with my head down (such as when petting my cat when she was laying on the floor), but that fully resolved quite quickly. I have not had any other side effects at all.	I take one 300mg Tekturna per day, in the morning, along with 10mg of Terazosin (Hytrin) and my blood pressure is wonderfully under control.

1351	crestor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high cholesterol	After 60 days on Crestor, 5 mg. per day, in combination with changes to my diet, my LDL (bad) cholesterol fell from 180 mg/dL (high risk) to 95 mg/dL (optimal), a drop of nearly half.  My triglyceride levels were reduced as well.	One side effect my doctor warned me to watch for was loss of muscle density.  I work out with weights usually three times a week.  I noticed no loss of muscle size, tone, or strength while taking Crestor.	"Because my LDL cholesterol was in the ""high risk"" range by American Heart Assn. standards, it was important to lower my risk level quickly.  In addition to taking 5 mg. of Crestor daily, I made disciplined adjustments to my diet.  I cut out animal fats, including dairy fats (like cheese and ice cream).  I cut out trans fats (like partially hydrogenated oils).  I greatly increased my consumption of wheat bran and oat bran, and raw vegetables.  I also took 500 mg. of time-release Niacin with my lunch each day.  Once I got my LDL cholesterol down to below 100 mg/dL, my doctor revised my prescription to only 2.5 mg. Crestor per day.  Since Crestor is not sold in this dosage, I must cut the pills in half.  I was tested again after 60 days at this dosage, and my LDL was still below 100 mg/dL.  And that was with a more relaxed diet."
2075	metformin	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anti-aging prophilatic	At the recommendation of the Life Extension foundation, I was taking 1850 mg per day of metformin prophilatically -- as an anti-aging medicine. Gene assay testing by Biomol resveals that metformin surpresses the Sir1 gene, acting as a calorie reduction memetic. Calorie Reduction is the only currently proven way to extend life span, and the hope is that metformin will mimic this. Resveratro ( herb ) also reputably does this.

2285	lexapro	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Before I started on the drug Lexapro, I felt lethargic and didn't want to get out of bed each morning. I hated getting up and facing the day. I would sit and watch the time pass by. Finally, I went to my Dr. for a checkup and he diagnosed me as being depressed. He put me on Wellbutrin and Lexapro 10 mg. I was instructed to take the pill 2 times per day everyday. For the first week I felt disconnected from myself but by the 2nd week I started to feel as if each morning was something to look forward to. I believe that Lexapro was a great addition to my life during my troubled times.	In the first week of treatment I felt disconnected from myself. I felt fuzzy and had trouble thinking clearly. It was this side effect that made me not want to take the drug anymore but I continued taking it 2 times per day. By the second week the fuzziness began to lift and I felt more like my normal self. After 2 months of taking Lexapro I felt like I was back to my old self again.	Lexapro was taken 2 times a day for 2 months.

There were no side effects associated with the drug. The doctor mentioned it would make birth control ineffective but had no confirmation of that.	Face and body cleared up conciderably.  It did take a while for the drug to take effect - but was worth it in the end.  I am now pregnant and will continue treatments after I have the baby.  Once I stopped taking it before I got pregnant - my face began to break out again. So you really have to continue to take it to keep the benefits.
1053	oracea	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	I liked this drug very much, because the stronger doses of antibiotics gave me horrible yeast infections. However, this one didn't quite so much. It still kept my acne at bay, and worked.	I still got yeast infections, however, they were not as bad and easier to get rid of than with the 75mg anitbiotic.	I took a 75 mg antibiotic for acne for about a year, then, because it was giving me bad yeast infections, my derm switched  me to Oracea. I got a card with the prescription that made it FREE with my insurance!!
868	paxil	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/anxiety	Definitely lowered anxiety.	"Didn't care as much as I needed to about deadlines and other stressful things. It was good that I wasn't overly anxious, but I also was less likely to work overtime to get things done.

I feel much better, with less pain than before.  I was very pleased with my checkup when I went to my doctor.  I feel the combination of the Fosamx and the Caltrate Plus
will continue to improve my condition and make my bones stronger."	They said I could get sick to my stomach, particularly if I didn't stay up for a minimum of 1/2 hour after taking this medication.  I am not allowed to lay down, as that will cause the sickness.  I also have to wait at least 1/2 hour before taking a drink of juice, coffee, tea, etc. This drug can also cause heartburn.	There is really not much to describe.  I now take the drug once a week instead of once everyday and am very happy with taking it this way.  As I mentioned above, as per my doctor's instructions, I also take Caltrate Plus 3x400mg.tablets a day, as he feels this will also help to strengthen and build my bones and keep them from becoming brittle.

Due to cardia weakness stomach contents can still travel up esophagus but no burning sensation is felt.  Regardless there is still some mild irritation in my esophagus.	Nothing noticeable.

Will likely be on Prevacid indefinitely due to GERD unless I have Nissen fundoplication surgery, and perhaps even still then.

1483	cymbalta	2	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	anxiety/ pain	My pain and anxiety were considerably lower. I felt like any situation was controllable and I was much more effective at my daily tasks.  The panic attacks, chest pains, and severe worry were almost completely gone. An added benefit was that muscle pain that I always seemed to have was also gone. I rarely had to take any pain meds. It seemed like a miracle.	At first I seemed a bit hot. I sweat more often. Then I began not being able to handle any stress at all. I began feeling like I needed other aids to help me deal with everyday stress and I have never needed anything before. Then my stomach began to act up. I began having constipation or diarrhea constantly. Never normal. I began throwing up and now my stomach does not digest food well at all. I also was unable to sleep, severe insomnia. I chose to take myself off the medication because the stomach issues have completely taken over my life and causing major disability. The side effect have intensified so much that I cannot function daily. Severe dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and my mind has been having lapses. Sometimes I cannot get out of bed. It has been over a week.	60mg once a day. I took every morning.
3471	ambien-cr	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	I did go to sleep more easily. I'm not sure how effective the time release is, because I often would wake up 4-5 hours later. Sometimes I didn't take it to sleep, but upon waking at 3pm, would take one to go back to sleep. They say to not take unless you have 8 hours to sleep, but this is not the case with me. The cutoff time is 4-5 hours.	I sometimes feel groggy the morning after. The one time I took it nightly for 3 weeks, I had been under a great deal of stress, and then jet lag (I travelled to Europe). In addition to the grogginess, I also just didn't feel good.Very hard to describe, but a bit rundown and not clear-headed. For occasional use, it is better than the alternative, though I'm not sure I believe the time-release is worth the cost. Next time I'll try the generic.	The treatment details? I like to have it on hand, but not to use unless I can't get to sleep any other way. Often, I go to sleep easily enough, but wake in the middle of the night. If it's 2-3am, I will take one, and might be groggy in the morning, but I function better than if I couldn't go back to sleep. If it's after 3:20am, I haven't tried it yet, because I get up early.
2461	angeliq	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	menopause for 2 years, first hormone pill taken	Angeliq did eliminate the night sweats and kept the hot flashes to a mininum.

No real side effects except infections (which the doctor said was Normal???).	I pill daily for a year.
427	imitrex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraine headaches	I was able to completely stop a migraine from happening once I felt one starting.  This has been extremely beneficial to me.  I have gotten my life back.  I would have 1-2 migraines a week which would put me in bed for 2 days.  I would take pain killers, which only knocked me out, doing nothing to alleviate the pain.  I was missing a large part of my life, being in bed.  Also I never knew when I would have to cancel plans or stay home from work due to a migraine.  I felt very unreliable, which is not me.  I am a very responsible person.	I have never had any negative side effects from Imitrex.	I take half of a tablet at the first sign that a migraine is starting.  Usually within 45-60 minutes the beginning symptoms of my migraine are gone.  Once in awhile, at this point (60 minutes after I have taken half of a tablet) the symptoms are not noticeable different, so I will take another half of a tablet.
2059	prempro	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraines	Migraine problem: I now only have rare occurance of migraines, less than once a year.  Before Prepro treatment I had a migraines almost continuously, and took Frova at least twice a week. Potential benefits is prevention or delay of osteoporosis, since my mother had severe osteoporsis.	Increased risks for breast cancer and conditions caused by clots like strokes.	I take the prescribed dosage every day, get annual breast exams, pap and BMD tests.  I try to stay physically active and eat healthy foods.
2319	lexapro	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression and generalized anxiety	I sought treatment for two problems in my life: my temper with my daughter and my lack of motivation.  This drug really helped me to control my temper.  In fact, the temper became nonexistent.  I used to yell a lot and stopped completely within two weeks of being on this medication.  However, this was the only benefit I experienced.	"I gained 15 pounds, which my doctor swears was not related to the medication.  BUT - I have always struggled to GAIN weight - I weighed 95 pounds in college and finally got up to a healthy 115 with a lot of hard work.  In just the two months of being on Lexapro, I went up to 130.  Not being able to fit into any of my clothes during summer is NOT helping my depression.

Immediately upon beginning to take Lexapro, I felt ""high"" for about two weeks.  My doctor says ""that shouldn't happen because of the medication.""  Well, I wasn't doing any other drugs, so I don't know what to tell you there.

Possibly the worst side effect I experienced was a DECREASE in motivation.  If you read above, you may have noticed that one of the two reasons I sought treatment was to increase my motivation.  I had a hard time keeping my house clean and getting started on tasks.  Well, within two weeks of starting this medication, I began needing long naps (3+ hours) every day just to function.  I watched TV for the rest of the day.  I had no interest in work and basically messed around all day instead of working.  It was a severe decrease in motivation.

Also, I had no sex drive and was unable to orgasm."	"I missed an appointment with my doctor and was not able to get a refill, so I have been off the Lexapro for a week.  In that time, I no longer needed to take naps and although I still procrastinate, it's back to the ""pre-Lexapro"" levels of procrastination, not the terrible levels I experienced while on the drug.  My temper did come back, though.  The withdrawals caused me to be so nauseous that I began throwing up and have had migraines ever since I stopped taking it.  (Again, my doctor said ""This medication shouldn't do that. Maybe you have the flu."")  Last night, though, I had great sex with my husband and was able to orgasm easily.  

Needless to say, at my doctor's appointment today I asked to be switched and will begin Wellbutrin right away.  (Oh, and I fired that doctor.)"
927	latisse	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	sparse eyelashes	For the first time in my life, I had enough eyelashes to apply mascara to.  I had tried eyelash extensions previously but they only worsened the problem by breaking off or pulling out what skimpy lashes I did have.  After several months of Latisse I have eyelashes and even though I apply it only to upper lashes it has made lower lashes grow too.	My eyelids became red and itchy for the first month of use.  It was bothersome but not enough that I quit using the product.  After about 4-6 weeks the redness went away and I have not been bothered by it again.	I applied a single drop of Latisse to a brush and ran it along the base of my upper lashes each night for the first 2 months and now just use it about every 2-3 days and my lashes have stayed longer and thicker even with less use.
240	wellbutrin-xl	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	The Wellbutrin with 20 mg of Prozac daily as an adjunct alleviated most symptoms of depression.  Better sleep as a result, and more energy throughout the day.	Jitters, trembling hands.	I had been taking Prozac with other medications for 10 years and it had stopped working for me.  After being prescribed Wellbutrin with it, I found I felt so much better.  However, when I tried to stop taking Prozac entirely and stay just on the Wellbutrin, my depression returned.  I have been on this cocktail now for 5 years and believe it has helped me immensly.
1377	biaxin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	pneumonia	Along with the tamiflu, pretty much cleared up any problems I had except for my cough. It was not as bad as a cough, but was still present. It took about 2 days for the medication to actually work but it does a good job.	Metallic taste in mouth, back pain, and headache (only for a few days). Nothing sleeping can't sure.	Went to my infirmary at my college, and was prescribed biaxin and tamiflu for my flu-like symptoms and pneumonia. Told to take both tamiflu and biaxin until finished (10 days for biaxin, 5 for tamiflu).

3763	spironolactone	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	facial hair	Hair loss. Helps hair follicles become less sensitive to protestosterone.	She had minimal hair loss on face and unwanted body areas and increased hair on head.	She had had testing done for high levels of testosterone which were sometimes average sometimes average-high (5.0). So it was not that she had too much testosterone, it was the way her hair folicles were responding to it. With this treatment you must be careful to get plenty of electrolytes in body. Also most effective if taken with birth control.
3350	lipitor	3	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	high colorestoral	My cholesterol was lowered by about 15 points. I did not seem to do anything else nor was it supposed to.	There were no discernible side effects. I took the drug for a year and i did not notice any side effects or changes after I stopped taking the drug.	I had High cholesterol and was considered to be at risk for heart attack. This drug was supposed to lower my cholesterol level which would reduce any heart plaque that might be building up in my arteries. I lowered my cholesterol somewhat but ultimately my diet did much more to change my counts.
3193	omnicef	3	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	sore throat	The treatment cured the sore throat for which it was perscribed.	During the 10 days taking the drug there were no side effects, however the day after the last dosage, I began having severe diarrhea, which persisted and was diagnosed as a bacterial infection called clostridium difficil, caused by the antibiotic I had taken.	I took omnicef orally for 10 days.  After the clostridium difficil was diagnosed, I had to start a new course of drugs which had to be repeated before the new infection/condition was cured.
3435	tazorac	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	antiaging	the treatment benefits for the cream Tazorac were improved skin tone, appearance of reduced wrinkles on forehead, undereye area, upper lip and nose. The skin felt softer and pimples were not prominent.	The side effects associated with the use of Tazorac daily for the treatment of antiaging skin is severe dry skin, erythema or skin redness and severe flaking and burning of the skin. There was quite abit of tingling even after the gel had dried overnight.	The treatment details for the skin gel Tazorac was to apply it once a day, or in my case nightly to the face. Not more than a small pea size of cream was directed however this was quickly absorbed into the skin and could not be applied over the remainging area of the face. Caution was applied in ensuring that the treatment gel was not applied to mucosal areas. Nevertheless it did radiate to areas such as the eyes and lips causing severe dryness and chafing.

133	valtrex	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	cold sore/fever blister (herpes-simplex)	"I took this medication, Valtrex, upon first experiencing the sensation of tingling and itching symptoms associated with the onset of the beginning of a cold sore/fever blisters (herpes-simplex) outbreak on my face which I had experienced many times before - usually once a year.
The next day after taking valtrex as prescribed, redness of the area affected on my face did develop and a blister did appear to be forming, but the affected area had ceased to itch. 
By the second day, there had been no further development of redness or additional blistering as there would have been in previous times before taking this medication.
On the third day, the redness and initial sign of blister formation had diminshed even further.
By the fifth day after taking this medication, there were no longer any signs or symptoms of what had started out to be, as I had experienced in my previous cold sore outbreaks, a 10 to 12 day spell of uncomfortable and unsightly fever blisters. 
This medication made a real and positive difference for me in the development, disconfort and duration of the symptoms of a cold sore/fever blisters (herpes-simplex) outbreak."	No negative side effects were experienced.	Take two tablets by mouth with water twice daily for one day.
1050	femring	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	menopause	Do not experience hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings or insomnia due to menopause when using the Femring.

I was just proscribed this medication yesterday took first one before bed as doctor said and woke up this morning feeling like i had drank a case of beer i stumbled getting up out of bed then i felt like i was dying of thirst was just wondering how normal this was? Oh and i was very sleepy and unable to wake up till nearly noon i started to sober up.

2859	soma	5	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	back injury	Minimized pain immediatley and made back injury seem non-existant	Could not remember doing things.  ALmost like being in a time warp.  Not good to take this medication unsupervised.	Have a bulging disc.  I was given Carisoprodol to relieve the pain.  I took the medication for 2 weeks.  I actually needed it much longer but the side effects were too intense.  This medication does relieve pain but in no way cures injury.
3382	lipitor	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high cholesterol	My overall cholesterol reduced to just over 4, but not LDL which still remained high within that total. This in my opinion is due to my thyroid condition.	After several months with no side effects I suddenly had continuous bad muscular neck pain and stiffness (particularly at night) which got better when I stopped the statin.	My cardiologist orginally prescribed atorvastatin and Omacor (at my asking about Omega 3 efficacy) due to my having a completed blocked artery in my heart (discovered on an ebt scan by my thyroid doc). I have since tried other statins but have not stayed on any of them very long due to lack of results in bringing down my LDL and side effects such as stomach pain.
3144	tylenol	3	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	pain	Little if any relief from headache.	Patient experienced severe nausea accompanied by moderate lower right abdominal pain.	Patient experienced severe headache accompanied by sensitivity to light.  Packing information claimed relief of headache as a suggested usage.  Patient purchased in reliance on packaging information.  After administration of the prescribed dosage over a period of twelve hours, little or no relief was noticed.
259	ultram	2	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	ovarian cysts/sciatic nerve	I found for me it was great for pain relief. Also, unlike some of the anti-inflammatory drugs I had taken in the past, I was not drowsy or sluggish during the day and I felt as if I could function normally.	In the beginning I had very slight dizziness that would quickly subside and immediately noticed a significant decrease in appetite. After about 2 months it did not seem to work as well for the pain as it hd been. I also had what felt like strong muscle spasms that made my entire body twitch, but only for a second and only once in a while.  Therefore, I decided that I would discontinue taking the medication.  That is when my problems began.	I was told by my doctor and pharmacist that this was a non-addictive medication, but when I quit taking it the withdrawal symptoms were extreme.  I had cold chills,severe body aches, diarrhea, nausea, headache, heart palpitations, anxiety, sweating, dizziness, vomiting and depressed feelings. I got a refill prescription to gradually come off of it after that and it occurred once again.  I have never had substance abuse issues but after doing some research learned that it is opiate-based and highly addictive. I have never felt that kind of pain and sickness in my life and pray I never do again. I have heard similar experiences from others as well. I would not recommend this drug and do not believe that it is not addictive.  From now on, I will do my homework before I take anything else. I now use OTC pain relievers and I encourage everyone who reads this to do the same before beginning treatment with tramadol or any pain reliever.
4126	chantix	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	stop smoking aid	Chantix did effectively reduce the urge to have a cigarette.  Taken twice per day was most effective, but side effects precluded that dosage for this patient(see below). Chantix was taken in the morning, and patient rarely, if ever, even thought of wanting or 'needing' a cigarette during the day.  In the evening, however, (when the second pill was due to be taken, but wasn't), and especially if patient had an alcoholic beverage, the urge to smoke returned  with a vengence, though a few puffs were all it took to kill the urge.  When patient stopped taking Chantix (after a year of use), the urge for nicotine returned.	The side effects for patient were 1) an upset stomach directly after taking pill, and 2) VERY disturbing and vivid dreams.  Patient found that, regarding the stomach upset, it was less important to have food in your stomach before taking the pill (stomach still got upset), than to actually take the pill in the midst of eating, (i.e. eat some food, take the pill, then eat some more).  This method of taking the pill virtually eliminated the stomach upset problem.  As to the vivid dreams, that is why the patient only took one pill in the morning and did not take the pill in the evening.  Although patient still occasionally had vivid dreams, the incidence was far less often than when taking the pill twice per day.	Chantix was prescribed per the guidelines noted by the manufacturer.  As noted above, the dosage was altered by the patient to alleviate negative side effects.  Although a stop-smoking plan was packaged with the initial prescription, the patient stopped participating in the follow up due to the lack of urges for cigarettes.  This, however, may be why the patient was on the prescription for a year versus a few months.
2555	ziana	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Easy to apply, combination of retinol and antibiotic.  Treated acne and an anti-aging treatment too.  The gel is odorless and goes on easily.  It is also non-greasy which is important if you have combination or oily skin.	Dry, peeling skin.  Skin was more sensitive for a short time.  Also need to wear a high SPF daily for skin protection.	Apply once a day at night on dry skin.
3541	vivelle-dot	5	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	surgical menopause	The benefits are that it does take away night sweats and hot flashes.	The side effect I have noticed is very sore swollen breasts and weight gain! Not sure if I want to stay on the Vivelle Dot for those reasons. The weight gain is making me very unhappy.	Change the patch twice a week.
3702	effexor-xr	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety/ ocpd /depression	"After trying Celexa for several months this drug finally made a difference with my anxiety and obsessive compulsive personality disorder. I noticed considerable change after using for 3-4 weeks. I am much more tolerant of things being ""out of control"" and have stopped some of my ""patterns""."	I have occasional night sweats, very vivid dreams and almost no sexual desire.	"I had taken this drug several years ago for depression. I weaned myself off gradually after using for about 1 and 1/2 years. I have been in counceling for the past 5 months and was diagnosed with OCPD. The constant perfectionism created so much anxiety for me. I felt ""stuck"". After trying Celexa for several months I thought I would give the Effexor another try. I am very glad I did. The only down side is the cost. The drug is very expensive."
1938	ultram-er	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	pain relief  from an infected cat bite wound	I was not able to ascertain any benefits from being treated with this medication.  Its purpose was pain relief, and I did not experience any alleviation of my pain.	I did not experience any side effects from taking this medication.	I was prescribed this medication after being seen by a doctor for a severely infected cat bite wound on the top of my left foot (which the doctor was concerned might become a systemic infection).  The foot and my entire left leg were very painful (especially upon movement), so the doctor had me take Ultram ER to help relieve the pain.  I was told to take 1 tablet daily as needed.  I did as instructed for two consecutive days and did not have any relief from my pain.  After I reported this to my doctor, she gave me a prescription for a stronger pain reliever (which did help).
1514	lotrel	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	high blood pressure	I have slightly high blood pressure on the diastolic side. Lotrel did a good job at maintaining good levels without increasing my pulse which I experienced with other BP meds.	After introducing Lotrel within two weeks I notices small red dots appear on my ankles which I thought was just a heat rash. I developed Petechiae which is the bleeding of small capillaries in the skin or mucous membrane. It appears as round pinpoint sized dots that vary in colour from red to blue or purple. These dots most commonly appear on the legs but can appear all over the body. Also an onset on Acne developed on my back at about the same time which was quite severe, and I have never had Acne related problems, even in my youth.	Currently my physician has taken me off of my BP meds to allow the Petechiae to fade, and to ensure that the reaction was indeed related to the Lotrel. It has been 4 days and slowly the rash and redness is mellowing.
1987	viagra	4	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	erectile disfunction	Viagra did help me in acheiving an erection after prostrate surgery. Other methods that were offered were not as attractive at the 3 times daily dosage of Viagra.	Dizzyiness and flushing of the skin. The side effects became worse the longer I used this drug. I became too dizzy to be able to drive and preform my job.	I was given Viagra to correct ED after a racial prostate surgery. The side effects vs. the benfits of Viagra were not worth it.
385	seasonale	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	While taking this method of birth control, my period only came once every three months. It was much lighter than before and only lasted 3 days instead of 6, which was normal before. I didn't experience any bloating. It's a very cost-effective method compared to three-month supply of normal 28 day cycle pills.	I noticed a slight weight gain (about 2 pounds) and still had issues with breakouts on my face prior to starting my period. There was also breakthrough bleeding, although very slight, at the times when my period would normally hit.	"It's very easy to take one pill per day and only have one ""off"" week in three months."
2447	wellbutrin-sr	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	decreased appetite, help to stop abusing alcohol	muscle aches, shakes, increased anxiety, strange thoughts, blurred vision	plan to keep taking and hope side effects decrease over time, possibly increasing dose, taking xanax to help with anxiety.  Took paxil and lexapro in past, gave me suicidal thoughts and actions when drinking alcohol with them.  Decided ssri's are not for me. keep hoping wellbutrin will help soon.
3364	lipitor	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	cholesterol slightly elevated	I didn't take the product long enough to evaluate the benefits. I quit because of side effects.	Very painful muscles, it took a while to even get them going in the morning.	When my cholesterol was found to be slightly elevated, my cardiologist put me on Lipitor. The first week was fine. The beginning of the second week I began to have sore muscles all over. By the end of the second week this was so bad I could hardly get out of bed in the morning. So I quit the Lipitor (did not consult the doctor on this); in the AARP magazine (or else newsletter, not sure which) there was a question for the medical doctor about possible natural replacements for the statin medications and he recommended Red Yeast Rice. I found a product with that and a few other cholesterol-lowering supplements (primarily CoQ-10) ad have been taking that with no side effects. I am due for another blood test in a couple of weeks, so we will see how well it has been working.
2236	allegra	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hay fever, allergies	significant, but not complete, relief from symptoms (sneezing, itchy eyes, cough, hives) while exposed to allergens - cats, certain plants. works best as preventative, but also works fine for relief from symptoms.	none at all.	tried rx for this in place of over-the-counter claritin/loratadine. this worked much better for animal allergies. I only take it as needed - not
3469	ambien-cr	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	insomnia	The benefits from the ambien CR were phenominal when trying to fall asleep. It worked very well.	The negative side effects were the continued night eating/binging/munchies. It has caused me to gained alot of weight, which I am now trying to control with another medication...which I will start tonight.	12.5 mg for insomnia nightly
705	accutane	8	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	acne	Finally clear skin and less oil!  Prior to accutane I HAD to wash my hair daily it was so oily  but now I easily an go a day or two.   My face and back were perfectly clear.	I would have spent my last $2 on lip balm, even if I hadn't eaten in a week!  Talk about dry and flaking!   Don't even THINK about waxing.  I didn't know that you couldn't wax (it was 12 years ago and there was less information about it then) it ripped my skin right off!  Scary.  About 4 ear after my first round I did another go with accutane because my acne had returned and now, 12 years later my skin is one again pretty bad.  Unfortunately not bad enough for accutane.  I mus say however, I have never been as bad as I was before my initial treatment and my back has stayed perfectly clear since then.	You have to really want it to get it!  For females it is a pain because you have to do two initial pregnancy tests and then continue ever month to get a refill.  They also monitor your blood for possible liver toxicity and your hdl levels.  It is one pill 2x daily.
2	nasonex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	congestion	Able to breath at night, less sneezing. I woke up with less nasal stufiness and felt clear headed. I also appreciated the moisturizing glycerin in Nasonex. I have a extremely dry nasal mucosa so there was definitely a benefit to that.	Did not have any side effects  and I felt extremely good during the allergy season. I actually enjoyed the moisterizing glycerin in my nose.	Use in the morning and evening in the spring allergy season. Continue to use even if symptoms disapear and 2 to 4 weeks prior to full blown allergy symptoms.
272	fortaz	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	uti	got rid of the uti, however, it took longer than d-mannose a non-prescription otc natural sugar which also had no side-effects	vaginal yeast infection which required treatment	This drug got rid of the infection, however, since that time I have discovered d-mannose from the health food store it works faster and does not have any side effects, is cheaper, no doctor visit required
2839	singulair	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	asthma	There were no benefits, only bad side effects in that the drug significantly worsened my ability to breath.	Shortness of breath, weakness.	Singulair was intended to address my Asthma and constant coughing due to allergic asthma; instead Singulair made my symptoms much worse.  Singulair significantly increased shortness of breath and fatigue--even during inactivity.  Due to the worsening of symptoms, I only took Singulair for two days.  Unfortunately, it took a few months before I was able to get back to my baseline (where I was prior to taking the drug).
277	xyrem	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	insomnia	While taking Xyrem, I slept exceptionally well at night, woke up rested, and strangely, within months of starting the medication, lost fifteen or more pounds.	"Some nights I felt significant joint pain, primarily in my elbows and my shoulders.  Other nights I suffered night sweats so severe that I would have to change out of my wet pajamas.  On occasion when falling asleep I would feel very giddy, almost ""high."""	Lack of sleep severely impacts my mood and none of the other sedative medications that I had tried worked, so I tried xyrem with beneficial effects.
1278	provigil	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	fatigue not being able to get up in am	When I started first taking it it was great. I would get up in the am no brain fog, and could work the whole day not being tired. By night time though I was exhausted. After a month or so I still get up early but by afternoon I am so tired I usually try to take a nap or just keep going and eventually it will get better. I have not tried taking another in the afternoon. I have tried to up the dose in the am with no difference.	I am not sure if this is from the provigil or not but I have started having major breathing issues. I have had this a long time ago but started taking celexa for it and it worked. Now I am taking klonopin for it sometimes it works sometimes not. I wonder if it is being caused from the provigil.	I just take one 200mg every morning when I get up. If I do not take it I thought is why I would be so sleepy during the day. But now I get sleepy anyway. But the waking up early is great were as I could not get up before.
1588	xanax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	tia's - anxiety	The medicine keeps me calm under all circumstances, and helps me to sleep at night. I used to have panic attacks at times before I began using this medicine. Now the panic attacks are few and far between. Although I do not like to drive while taking the medicine, if I must I can with no problems. In social situations I am much more myself and can relax and have fun. I have had 3 mini-strokes. Since I began treatment with Xanax I have not had a single episode.	I have had no side effects from the use of this medicine. When I first started the medication it would make me sleepy. After time this side effect past and I have no problems now.	Upon treatment I found that results were immediate. I have been told that this drug is highly addictive, however that does not concern me as my Neurologist will keep me on this medicine for the remainder of my life.
2321	lexapro	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	major depression/anxiety	"Before Lexapro I was so depressed I could not function. I forced myself to work, and would come home exhausted. I had suicidal ideation and severe anxiety. I had ""bouts"" of depression before, but was never treated. My separation and death of my Mother and loss of my job in one years time pushed me past what I could get myself out of. I was irritable, unsociable, had no desire to eat (lost 50 lbs that I could stand to lose in 6 months), cried all the time. I started Lexapro 3 months ago, almost 4. I began at 10 mg and it was upped to 20 mg. I feel like I am starting to have my life back. I laugh again (genuinely). I can get up for work, I can socialize. I still have days where I feel like crying and am very scared.. but it passes quickly. I have almost regained my general sense of optimism again. (I was always happy go lucky). I have NO ideation anymore.Lexapro is giving me my life back. It is like someone cleaned a really dirty window. I can see things more clearly now and do not ruminate as much as I did or have guilt feelings that are inappropriate. It saved my life."	I have some difficulty sleeping (waking up in the night). Sometimes I have diarrhea, but not enough so it stops me from taking it. I have not had any weight gain, but do feel bloated sometimes. Once in awhile I get a weird high feeling which passes very quickly.	I have found  that I have to take it at night because of the sedating effect it seems to have on me, but that is not a problem. I was on 10 mg, and ramped up to 20 mg fairly quickly, which was like a shock to my body.. that 3 or 4 days were like a haze, but I stuck with it and it passed. I am on it for almost 4 months now and I am feeling much more like myself.
2006	vicodin	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	periodontal surgery	There was a significant reduction in mouth pain. I was able to relax following periodontal surgey and not worry about family obligations and responsibilities.	I had drowsiness, dizziness, ichy at night with some nausea and dizziness in the mornings.	I was prescribed vicoden in case I had measurable pain following peridontal gum surgery. I was presribed to take the Vicoden PRN for pain every 4-6 hours.
3270	zoloft	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	depression	Moderate lifting of depressive episode, made it so I could function better in everyday life.	None that I could detect. Nothing noticeable. Maybe just a bit more insomnia but I had that before taking Zoloft.	I went to my internist and told him that I wanted to be put on a low dose of an antidepressant and something for my anxiety . I had been on Effexor for many years, awile ago. Effexor worked but the withdrawal symptoms were horrible, even if I so much as missed a dose. Perhaps it was a placebo effect, but I felt the Zoloft working after about a week. Nothing earth shattering,but noticeable.
3582	differin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	The patient saw effective acne control within 4 weeks.  She still had occasional acne lesions but saw clearing of most of the comedones.  Because there were few new acne lesions, the hyperpigmentation she got along with the acne was not happening, and the hydroquinone helped to clear the hyperpigmentation she already had.  At four weeks, her skin tone was even.	Dryness at the corners of the mouth was the major problem. I find if you apply moisturizer or a small amount of vaseline to the area prior to apply the Differin, the irritation will resolve quickly.	Medication is easy to use, and high patient satisfaction.
2957	zyban	9	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	smoking	I stopped smoking after one week of starting the treatment. I never picked up another cigarette. The cravings for the sensation of smoking, as well as the craving for nicotine were short and sharp, and lessened within a short period of time. I was able to sit with another smoker and not smoke ( or want to smoke) within one and a half weeks of stopping. Incidently I lost 4 - 5 Kgs within 4 weeks of taking the drug.	There was a feeling of complete disassociation from reality, people, feelings. I felt as if i was depressed. However at the same time I experienced times of being unable to control any emotions, my mood swings were extreme and I was completly unable to stop some fairly manic expressions of emotions. This could have been the nicotine withdrawal, but continued for a two - three month period. I stopped the drug about three weeks before prescribed as I became tired of the inability to feel happy / pleased / content. I experienced mild episodes of anxiety, vertigo and breathlessness - as I was aware these were side effects they did not overly concern me.	I took one 150 mg tablet for seven days, stopped smoking on the sixth day. As prescribed I took one tablet twice a day for six weeks. After consulting the doctor over my cncerns of the side efeects I took one 150 mg tablet a day for the next four weeks.
2088	anafranil	4	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	ocd	Over time, this drug caused a massive reduction in my OCD hand washing rituals. I also no longer had to avoid public places for fear of germs.  Furthermore, clomipramine caused an immediate decrease in day to day anxiety and worry.	Inability to reach orgasm or ejaculate. Dry mouth.	I suffered severe depression and OCD.  Clomipramine was not the first drug tried, but it was the only SSRI to work for me. However, any benefits to SSRI drugs are countered by the havoc they play on your sex life.
3226	nuvaring	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	THE NUVARING HAS PROVEN TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE FOR ME. I HAVE HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH BIRTH CONTROL THROUGHOUT MY LIFE. HAVING TRIED MANY IF NOT ALL POSSIBLE  BIRTH CONTROL TREATMENTS, I BELIEVE THIS IS THE ONE THAT WORKS THE BEST FOR ME. IT IS PRACTICAL AND VERY FEW SIDE EFFECTS WHEN COMPARED TO THE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES, IUDs OR  INJECTIONS.	SO FAR, I HAVE ONLY EXPERIENCED HEADACHES AROUND THE TIME WHEN I TAKE OUT MY RING.	IT IS VERY EASY TO USE, YOU INSERT IT IN THE VAGINA, IT STAYS IN FOR 3 WEEKS AND TAKE IT OUT FOR ONE TO HAVE YOUR PERIOD. THEN PUT A NEW ONE IN. VERY EASY TO USE AND THE PARTNER DOES NOT FEEL DISCOMFORT DUE TO THE RING.
2518	motrin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	menstrual cramping	The benefits are that the medication is very effective in treating menstrual cramping. Three times daily dosage is also quite convenient. I have been taking this medication for over 10 years and I don't see any long term side effects associated with it. Another benefit is that the medication is very useful in preventing menstrual cramp. If it is taken BEFORE menstruation, I won't experience any cramp at all.	Side effects are I occasionally experience heartburn and nausea after taking the medication if I do not take it with food. Also another downside of this medication is that if i take it when the cramping has started long and severe, it is less effective and it takes a lot longer for the medication to be effective, no matter how much i take.	Overall I'm very satisfied with the medication in it's efficacy and side effects profile. I only experience occasional side effects and in general the medication is very effective in treating and preventing menstrual cramping. However, the medication is best being taken before the cramping has started or immediately when the cramping starts because the longer you wait, the less effective the medication is, regardless the dose of the medication.

3493	serzone	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	generalized anxiety disorder	Had generalized anxiety daily prior to treatment, and panic attacks that impaired ability to function normally and quality of life in general. Medication did not completely eliminate feelings of anxiety, but did a great job of reducing them. Taking the medication Serzone, made it possible to rely on the medication xanax less and less, to the point only had to take it seldom as needed.	Noticed when skipping a dosage for 2-3 days, heightened anxiety returned.	Took 200 to 400 mg. of medication for 6 years for the treatment of anxiety.

1255	flomax	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	kidney pain, difficult urination	As near as we can tell, this drug (which is intended for men with enlarged prostates) relaxed ureter muscles, relieving the sensation of kidney stone pain, and also relaxed bladder muscles that had caused painful urination.	It made me drowsy all week; also sporadic dizziness.  Chronic nasal congestion (stuffy nose) was also unpleasant.	"Once kidney stones were ruled out as the cause, the choices were to ""wait it out,"" or to try this medication. Directions were pretty straightforward---take the pill after a meal; don't drive if feeling dizzy or drowsy; drink plenty of water."
4145	percocet	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	shoulder pain	reduction of pain, pain reduction was necessary in order to be able to withstand the pain of aggressive physical therapy, i reduced the frequency of use after the first 3 days to avoid secondary complications such as intestinal damage, constipation, etc.	constipation, stomach upset	this was re-hab following shoulder arthroscopic surgery

2031	protonix	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	Effectively controlled acid reflux.  Before treatment patient had severe acid reflux which was not controlled by other medications.  After trying many other drugs the patient was prescribed protonix and it worked very effectively.  The patient was then able to eat regular meals with no ill effects.	None.  There didn't appear to be any side effects to taking this prescription.  The one drawback was that it took time to dissolve and frequently there was discomfit prior to it dissolving.	Took medicine as prescribed, twice daily
2944	mirapex	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	restless leg syndrome	First treatment in 50 years that helped the constant but elusive pain in my nervous system, causing me to sleep an hour or two at a time at best.  The pain is 100% gone when I take the mirapex ... back when I do not.	Can fall asleep at my desk or driving without much notice.  Reduced the amount I was taking from 200 mg to the 100mg.	I take it at bedtime nightly.
179	dexamethasone	3	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	bronchial infection	marginal, not sure if recovrey was from the drug or from the infection running it's course.	"none; however, anxiety was a result because of the confusing way the dosage was explained.  Here is the detail:
2 tabs today, then 2 tabs twice a day for x3 days, 1 tab 2x daily x2 days, then 1 tab in am x2 days."	Chronic bronchitis-type sympptoms were treated, daily dosage varied and was confusing and difficult to administer.  Not able to pinpoint if recovery came from the infection running it's course or from the drug.  No side affects, but anxiety taking a steriod in such an unusual way.
2097	renova	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Wrinles seemed less defined	Rash, red eyes	Apply once dayly
2637	toradol	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	for  back pain	None. She did an anaphylaxis schock and she did not receive any benefit .	Shock anaphylactic	It was used for  back pain . She did a severe reaction ( anaphylactic schock). We did the right treatment .

2145	caduet	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	cholesterol/high blood pressure	apparently lowered cholesterol and blood pressure	"Awful!  Difficulty sleeping, extreme fatigue.  Weight gain. Swollen knees, ankles and feet.  My knees were severely affected -- difficulty getting up and down stairs, could not get out of a car by myself.  When I stopped taking the drug, my knees improved to the point where I am freely ambulatory, but they are still stiff with some pain.  I have had to consult an orthopedist, who tells me he has seen MANY such cases.  X-rays show I have the knees ""of a person 20 years younger,"" but the muscles have been grossly affected."	In place of the Caduet, which I stopped against the objections of my internist, I am using natural substances such as policosanol, CoQ10, and pycnogenol.  I am also losing weight, and have professional therapy to try to regain strength in my knees.
3486	diazepam	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	stress	The drug calmed me down and stopped me from crying constantly.I only took it when absolutely necessary which was a huge benefit, unlike the anti anxiety drugs given out now which you have to take every day for long periods.Valium works instantly and I never had any problems at all with it. I do not understand why it is not given out instead of all these other antidepressants which are readily available and cause huge problems and come with awful side effects.	None to speak of except for slight tiredness.	To be taken 3 times a day, but I only took as & when necessary.
109	celebrex	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	arthritis	I started out with 100 mg twice a day and after about 3 years I've had to increase dosage to 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg at bedtime. It seems to keep my arthritis fairly under control but I have never been able to just take it once a day but I've also had arthritus for 35+ years. Unfortunatelt cold fronts and weather changes still bother my joints. This mediicine keeps me active and pretty much able to do most of what I want to do.	I haven't really had any noticeable side effects.	See above. I am concerned thaqt the dosage might have to be upped after a few more years.
691	accutane	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	severe acne	My skin cleared up and my pores shrank significantly. My skin looked flawless. My pores have remained smaller long-term (5+ years post treatment).	My skin got very dry, including my lips. I had to use a significantly heaver moisturizer and lip ointment to keep my skin/lips from cracking.	"I had monthly lab work and doctor's visits to make sure I was having no ill effects, which I did not. I suffered no psychological symptoms or depression, in fact I felt less depressed because my skin looked so much better.

I would encourage patients and doctors not to be so frightened of this drug. It's a serious drug and bears monitoring, but lots of drugs are. I tried Retin-A and that made my skin look and feel horrible, as did other topical treatments. The benefits to your skin and your self-esteem make Accutane worth consideration if other treatments have not been effective."
3271	zoloft	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	relaxed	tired	Taking zoloft once a day IF YOU ARE REALLY DEPRESSED may work wonders. But try to gat off of it as soon as possible. Long term side effects are still not known.
1321	prevacid	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	acid reflux	I suffered from acid reflux symptoms which included mild stomach upset and a full feeling after eating. Prevacid eliminated these symtoms very effectively to the point that I did not need repeated doses of over the counter anti-gas medication and antacids.	Taken daily, Prevacid unfortunately caused severe side effects which included dizziness and a woozy feeling like I was over medicated. The side effects were so severe that I often was unable to work and needed to lie down and occasionally took a nap.	Prior to taking Prevacid, my symptoms required daily doses of anti-gas medications and occasional antacids. Although Prevacid was very effective, I discontinued use of it and switched to over the conter Zantac because of the side effects. As a note, I am very sensitive to medications and often experience side effects from different medications and thus refrain from any unless experiencing severe symptoms.
1004	actiq	1	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	chronic pain	"Without question, Actiq is an extremely effective drug if you are in chronic severe pain and have no responsibilities.  Actiq relaxes the body and the brain becomes numb and able to handle ongoing pain effectively.  It is fast acting in the subcutaneous, ""lollipop"" form and within minutes you are comfortable.
The flavor is also quite pleasant."	"Actiq, when taken as directed, induces a feeling of numbness. and slurred speech is common. Thinking becomes confused and it is not unusual to fall asleep in mid-sentence. Actiq slows breathing and causes extreme tiredness.  Actiq are highly addictive and it is literally impossible to stop taking them without a medical detoxification.
Actiq delivered in subcutaneous form causes the teeth to rot after extended use of more than 6 months."	"Actiq should only be taken by individuals who are in severe, chronic pain where
tolerance to the drug will not become problematic.  It needs to be closely monitored and locked away out of reach of children or any adult who may have problems with addiction.
My  chronic  pain condition was followed by a Pain Center at a reputable hospital.  The use of opioids were used only after all other treatments for
my condition had failed.
Unfortunately, once Actiq was introduced to me, my medical problems worsened, although my pain was under control.  I was unable to function responsibly, began dealing with symptoms of withdrawal whenever I didn't take it, which at times became worse than my actual pain and discomfort.  I became more of a patient to my family and on a side note, at age 40 lost 4 molars due to the ingredients present in the ""lollipops"" I was taking.
I had no choice but to be hospitalized for an inpatient medical detox in order to safely get this horrible drug out of my body.  Fortunately my husband and I were fortunate enought to have the money to go through this detox program.
I have no memory of 2 years of my life, thanks to an ignorant, negligent doctor and the drug, Actiq.  
Believe it or not, my painful conditions are now completely under control now, and I am able to care for my husband and children, and work!  After my experience with Actiq I no longer believe in the use of pharmaceutical products as a whole, and owe my good health to diet, exercise and several natural supplements.  I have never felt better in my life!"

489	meridia	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	weight loss	I have been taking meridia for the last 6 weeks and have lost 16 lbs.  It has decreased my appetite and I am not thinking about food all the time.  Combined with diet and exercise this has helped me out a lot.	The only side effects that I have experienced so far is the dry mouth and the odd time I have a mild headache but that has since passed.	Meridia combined with diet and exercise has made loosing weight a lot easier this is the boost that I needed to change my life style.
4075	mobic	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	back pain	No impact whatsoever.  It was like I wasn't even taking anything.  The OTC ibuprofen I was taking before my doctor appointment was more effective.	None.  Seriously, I could not even tell I had taken a drug, there were no impacts whatsover, either positive or negative.	Took 2 tablets (15 mg) total, once daily in the morning.  Also took Zanaflex, but only at night.  The Zanaflex helped - for about 3 hours.  When I was just on the meloxicam, I was in terrible pain.  The injury being treated was mid-back pain, caused by straining/overusing my back muscles in a ski competition.  I have a 30 day prescription for meloxicam, but I'm calling the doctor tomorrow to ask for something different; this drug is totally pointless for me.
1261	provigil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	excessive fatigue	As a medical professional (newly graduated medical student now in first year of residency), I am able to feel more alert and focused during the day even after having been up all night.  As free time is scarce in residency, I am now able to study when I would otherwise be too exhausted to do anything.	I really did not have any side effects.  It has been reported that headache is common, however I did not experience that at all.  I did not have any problems with my sleep schedule either.	Recommended dose is 200mg once a day, can also be taken again in the afternoon if needed.
3121	ortho-tri-cyclen	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control method	"-Prevented pregnancy perfectly
-Enlarged breasts
-Regulated periods
-Lighter flow during menstrual cycle
-Cleared skin for (moderate) acne"	For the first month, there was slight depression/moodiness, but that may have been due to the fact my body was adjusting to being on birth control	"I've been on Ortho TRI-Cyclen for a year now, and have had little to no problems with it. Before going on the pill, I would have awfully irregular periods, and very bad cramps the first day of my cycle. Since going on it, my periods have become light, and regular. My breast have gotten larger, and my skin has cleared up. This pill is great! This being said, my results may have been so wonderful because I make ABSOLUTELY sure that I take it EVERYDAY at the SAME TIME.

Wonderful pill, great side affects after the first month moodiness clears up. Just be sure to always take it everyday at the same time."
1340	tegretol	5	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	epilepsy	i no longer had seizures. i was having a seizure everytime i ate food. my sizure responce was food.	my appetite increases. i gained weight i was tired all the time. i also had balance problems i also had periods of nasuea	I was givin an eeg. from that point my doctor decided i needed a fairly high dose It took 30 days before enough tegretol had built up in my system before the seizures were under control.
591	zestoretic	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	After trying a variety of high blood pressure medicines my doctor prescribed Zestoretic.  Zestoretic lowered my blood pressure to acceptable levels of 100/70 from 130/90.  The difference between this medicine and prior ones seems to be the diuretic.  After experiencing the positive benefits of the diuretic I began watching my sodium intake.  I avoid any food that contains 900 or over mgs of sodium per serving.  This pretty much eliminates most canned soups, dry packaged side dishes and frozen foods.  After 16 months of watching my sodium intake I have become much more sensitive to sodium and no longer use table salt	None	I take two tablets once a day at breakfast.
3137	malarone	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	malaria prevention	Malaria prevention.  Also patient did not intcounter any mosquito bites.	The patient felt mild headeaches, in addition there were mild symptoms of nausea	The pills were taken three days before the flight to South Africa, specifically one pill a day for ten days or duration of trip. Upon arrival home to the United States the pills were taken for a few more days.
2395	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	low under active thyroid	I became more active and lost 10 of the 14 pounds I had gained.  I have more energy, and feel like myself again.	I never had any side effects.  The only drawback is that you have to take the medication on an empty stomach or wait three hours after you eat.  However, they prefer you take it in the morning.  So what I do is keep my medicaton next to my bed and take it the very first time I wake up in the morning whether it's 4, 5, or 6 am.	I returned from vacation in August by November I had gained 14 pounds.  I did not know why.  I was eating the same amount of food.  I went to see the doctor and after a complete check up and blood tests they found I had a low under active thyroid.  As I think back, I did feel more tired, I did not want to join my kids and spouse to do anything instead I would go to bed early.  That is not like me.  I am the type of person who would get up and go anytime.  I thought I was just tired.  Now, I reflect and remember that I stopped doing things with my family, became less active and all along I thought it was because I was tired when in actuality my thyroid was off.
1164	zofran	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	nausea/vomiting	Completely controlled nausea and vomiting.	Some sleepiness	I was dealing with unrelenting nausea and vomiting for about five months.  A combination of other drugs was tried, and they had a limited ability to control the nausea. I had lost a lot of weight, and was at the point where the weight loss had left me pale and weak. When Zofran was added to the list of drugs I was given, I had immediate relief and was able to stop taking several of the other drugs.  I now take Zofran in the morning and evening and have stopped an unwanted weight loss and can enjoy eating again.   I recently had a biopsy where I had to have nothing in my stomach for twelve hours.  The prescribed pain killers after the procedure immediately brought back the vomiting, and my friend reminded the nurse that I usually used Zofran for that.  Within ten minutes after giving me a dose the nausea was gone and I was able to get much needed rest.
2735	elavil	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	fibromyalgia	I was only sleeping around 5 hrs per night. I felt sleepy ALL the time. I had episodes when my whole body would ache, every joint and muscle. It felt like someone had their hands around my neck, squeezing it until my eyes would pop out	I started craving carbs. I gained weight but I didn't care because I was feeling REALLY good. As the years went by, I had to keep increasing and was up to 100mg. I had VERY dry mouth, I got to where I couldn't talk because my throat was so dry. I had to have a bottle of water next to me ALL the time, and I chewed gum constantly. I had to take laxatives every 3 days. I was so sick of it, I went to my doctor to see what was wrong with me. She thought it might be the amitriptyline, so she told me to wean off of it and she gave me 30mg of Cymbalta to start. I went down to 50mg and already started to feel my mouth was not so dry. Not sure how the Cymbalta is going to work since I've only taken it 4 days now, but I'm hoping it works.	I started with 10mg.  I noticed a difference after just one week. It worked really GREAT. I was able to sleep with no problems at all. If I woke up for any reason, I'd just fall back to sleep right away.  It was a lifesaver to me. I wish I could still take it.
3439	tazorac	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hyperpigmentation, photoaging, mild hormonal acne	marked reduction in hyperpigmented (age) spots, marked reduction in wrinkles around mouth and eyes, skin surface became much smoother and softer.  Truly turned back time.  Visible results within weeks and first 2 months were remarkable, but over the last year, the benefits have continued and areas of brown discoloration I thought would need laser therapy are almost cleared up!  I also had some scar dents that have cleared up and/or mostly gone!	"dryness, redness, irritation and peeling - it took a gradual working up to the 1% dosage without having serious redness/itching-pain/dryness/sensitivity.  I had already been on retin-A so my skin was already acclimated somewhat and yet I still had side effects.  I discovered that it's most important to wait at least 40-60 min. after washing your face before applying and apply only the very least amt necessary to have the thinnest of layers (more than that and you just get peeling).  And imperative NOT to use soap - change to a cleanser - cetaphil or other.  also,  an hour or two after applying, add a strong moisturizer.  With time, i needed a stronger daytime moisturizer too.  Redness/itching/burning/ decreased significantly within 2-3 months but skin remains highly sensitive and prone to dryness.  Sunscreen is a must and it was hard to find one that did not make my skin sting though most of the time, that stinging didn't last long (5-10 mins).  Overall though, with patience and time and not pushing and rushing things..it was well worth it 
Oh, and sometimes, like when I travelled to dry locations, I had to stop treatment temporarily , or had severely dry and peeling skin.  I have since discovered vaseline as a great preventative for that ! :)"	see above (included in above answer)
1757	topamax	10	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	tourette syndrome	The treatment benefits from Topamax did not outweigh the side effects.  There was minimal reduction in vocal tics caused by Tourette Syndrome and significant reduction in appetite that led to weight loss of approx. 20 lbs.	Memory and cognitive impairment, eye pain and vision blurriness.	Topamax 50 mg was prescribed at bedtime for reduction of severe vocal tics.  Medication was prescribed by a neurologist.  The side effects far outweighed the benefits of this medication.
3535	lunesta	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	insomina	NONE	HORRIABLE taste in mouth with 15 minutes of taking it. Even breathing tasted bad as when the air hit my mouth and airway the taste was intensified. I tried to drink water to get rid of the taste and promptly threw up the taste was so bad. Within half an hour of taking the pill I developed a red rash on my face, and in an hour had a full blown lights and floaties migraine. To top it all of my insomonia was actually MADE worse. Two hours after taking the pill I am more awake and alert then I was BEFORE taking it.	This is by far the worst medication I have ever taken. I got no help, in fact the problem got much worse and the side effects were unbearable!
1058	oracea	4	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	rosacea	Cleared acne	Joint pain, back pain and cramping	Oracea 40 mg QD for 4 days.  Is clearing the cystic acne on face but will be discontinuing due to the pain and discomfort in joints and back.  Feels like the flu, which I do not have.  This discomfort is being caused by Oracea.
3394	spiriva	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	asthma	I used to live on my MDI(combivent). I started maintenance drugs Spiriva and Symbicort and it has changed my world. I, on adverage, dont have to take my MDI at all anymore. I have my days that I have to, living in Texas can be a nightmare of allergies. I can do more activities without feeling so short of breath. I have not had any major side effects yet...Overall after starting Spiriva I'm doing much better. For anyone with Asthma I would suggest they try this drug.	I have really had no major side effects yet. Maybe, if any, a headache and I'm not sure that is one?	Well, theres not a whole lot to say about the treatment details. I take one dose per day in the morning. Its a dry disk powder that you inhale. Its very easy, quick, and seems to work very fast.
1181	prozac	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	According to her & what I was able to observe  there was not much benefits to this treatment  .	"There was terrible side effects while on the treatment  but even worst when she tried to stop the medication.  While on the treatment the worst side effect was the suicidal thoughts   .  Also  constant dry mouth , headaches .
   when she discontinued the treatment   the dizziness  & the ringing in the ears were unbearable ."	"She had to take anti-nauseated pills  for the nausea  , dizziness  plus other   pills for the ringing in the ears . 

 She succeeded after two   agonizing months  & will never take prozac again.
 
 I think every doctor should inform patients of the withdrawal side effects of this  drug ."
2473	enbrel	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	ankylosing spondylitis	Little improvement for first week or so but then incredible turnaround. Went from regularly not being able to walk properly due to inflamed sacroiliac joints and general back pain and flu-like aches across whole body most days to a new woman! After 3 months have noticed the last couple of weeks some of the aches and pains starting to come back slightly towards end of the week but overall extremely positive.	Discomfort at injection side, seen little increased infection (i.e colds, flu etc) however only been taking for 3 months so far	Enbrel weekly - self injected subcutaneously, 50mg

2585	pilocarpine	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	high intraocular pressure (glaucoma)	The drug caused the iris to contract so that the drains that relieve fluid buildup causing high pressure are pulled open.  While using the drug the pressure in my eyes remained stable but high.  It had the added benefit of sharpening my vision for a long time so that I did not need to wear glasses for reading phonebooks,etc.	The iris atrophied.  It is now impossible for my pupil to open to adjust to changing light conditions.  The iris aslo scarred to the lense making a followup cataract removal operation complicated.  The drug sped up the formation of cataracts.	The drug in drop form was put in each eye three times a day.  It was a nuisance to have to carry it with me for mid day application.  The chemicals in the drops sting and leave your eyes watering for a minute or so.  Otherwise it was easy to use, although the proper technique for putting in the drops without touching the eyeball takes a little practice and a steady hand
2224	allegra	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	severe allergies	Almost immediate relief of allergy symptoms, freer breathing	None	I suffered from severe allergic reactions to almost all allergens.  My nasal passages would constrict & I could not breathe through my  nose.  As a result, my sinuses would clog up & I would experience severe sinus headaches.  Taking this medication only as needed -- when I began to first experience the severe symptoms -- has actually seemed to decrease my symptoms overall.  I don't need to use the medication as often as I did when I first began taking it.  In fact, my original prescription was filled 4/8/2007 for a quantity of 30 and I still have four pills left!
3649	retin-a	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Since using the Retin-A along with the Accutane, I have noticed a great improvement in the look of my skin.  There are less clogged pores and it definitely more smooth and even in skin tone.  Any fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished but it hasn't helped much with fine lines around my eyes.	It does cause the skin to flake and peel but this can be counteracted with a good moisturizer.  Also, my face gets red or flushed easily with the slightest irritant.  Lastly, not being able to stay in the sun is a downfall.	I use Retin-A 0.25% every evening along with 70 mg of Accutane a day.  I will have to continue the Retin-A for at least a year.
2598	phenergan	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	nausea	The medication ease the nausea and my stomach was at ease for at more than a week.  The medication relaxed the muscles in my stomach and released the gas trapped.	The medication made you very tired.  Soon after taking the medication you fell asleep.  After waking up, you feel groggy and tired.  The feeling is like you didn't get enough sleep and you will feel this way all day.	I was being treated for nausea cause by trapped gas in the stomach and intestines.
2201	enalapril	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	The treatment reulted in significantly lower blood pressure - in total a drop of over 30 points on both the upper and lower readings.	none	The pharmaceutical therapy was combined with moderate excercise (eg. walking 3 miles 3-4 times a week) and life style modification such as meditation, enhanced body-mind awareness and diet changes, such as cutting eliminating red meat and cutting down on hot spices, wheat, processed grains and sugar and milk products, while significantly increasing complex carbohydrates, lentils, and dietary fiber.
3718	lamictal	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	bipolar disorder	mood stability and two safe preganancies wtih healthy children.	none- one of the first times a bipolar medication has NOT caused side effects for me.	"The only downside from lamictal is you need to slowly up the dosage to a therapuetic level, so you can't take it if you are in a mood ""crisis""."
1524	glucophage	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	diabetes	helped lower blood sugar	severe ankle swelling, stomach pain	Took Metformin (2) times along with Actos. Lowered blood sugar somewhat, but the side effects were terrible. Cut dose back to just Metformin, dropped Actos completely. Along with diet change & excercise it has lowered blood sugar levels I would say 20%
1128	evista	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	slight loss of calcium in hip area	Other Osteoporosis prevention drugs have many side effects.  This particular drug has almost no side effects and has shown evidence in clinical testing to reduce the occurance of breast cancer.  The only side effects I had are leg cramps and apparently, only a very few women experience this condition.	cramps in lower legs.  I took a magnesium supplement and it reduced the effect.	It is expensive.  My health benefits are not very good, so it costs around $100.00 a month.  Other than the periodic leg cramps, I have no other side effects.
884	paxil	6	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	A more positive outlook and much easier social interaction.  Introversion diminished and friendly extroversion became more natural.  It was easier to start and finish projects because energy previously wasted on negative thoughts and actions was now available for constructive purposes.	"A total loss of any sexual sensation.  Prior to treatment interest in sex was low but paradoxically, when a feeling of psychological well-being produced a renewed interest in sex, the drug also removed the physical ability to engage in it.  Orgasm was impossible and physical arousal was too weak to be effective. 
The worst part was withdrawal following treatment.  It took at least 6 months of extremely gradual tapering off to withdraw, and I was on a low dose.  Any attempt to withdraw faster would produce chaotic mood swings from hysterical laughter to violent, yelling rages.  Every emotion, however mild, was magnified exponentially.  Sexual sensation also went off the scale with such hypersensitivity that ejaculations happened spontaneously without any physical stimulation - a sneeze or a yawning stretch would morph into an immediate ejaculating orgasm without any erection.  Throughout the withdrawal period a sensation of electric brain shocks extending to the arms and trunk would accompany any quick eye movement."	Just the one pill each morning.  This medication is such a double-edged sword that I could not recommend it.  The long term dangers of sustained treatment are too great, as evidenced by the severe withdrawal effects.  It really 'rewires' your brain and those effects may be unpredictable from person to person.

Previously I was treating my eczema with topical corticosteroids like hydrocortisone and fluticasone. I had been using topical steroids for years and had developed cystic acne. After a few courses of antibiotics for acne treatment I realized using antibiotics was pointless if I continue to use topical steroids. I decided to try an anti-histamine which surprisingly helped greatly. Enough so i could discontinue my hydrocortisone. Using loratadine helped my eczema be tolerable but not ""cured"". I also managed my eczema with a lot of moisturizing."	none, had a period of constipation for a couple of weeks, months after starting loratadine which has ceased currently.

Very shortly after beginning this drug, my hot flashes stopped.  I am hoping there are other benefits like preserving the integrity of my body, but it may be too soon to tell.  It definitely alleviated the hot flashes, however.	None that I have noticed, so far.	This drug comes in a very small patch which you change every three to four days.  It's worn on the lower abdomen.  That's it.  You really can't feel it, and don't even know it's there.

I was on Lexapro for a little over a year, but gained about 30 pounds. Due to the excessive weight gain I gradually went off the Lexapro. Well- about 5 weeks later my headaches came back. My Dr. reccomended Cymbalta b/c it ""weight neutral"" and also has pain relieving properties."	I haven't experienced any typical anti-depressant side effects with Cymbalta (dry mouth, nausea, heart racing, figgity). The only thing I have noticed is a few hrs after I take it I get really tired, and could use a nap. So, I'm going to try taking it later in the day so I don't crash in the middle of the day.	Cymbalta was presribed for me to treat my chronic tension headaches and mild depresion.
2226	allegra	6	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergies	The treatment benefits were only temporary.  While it made sneezing and watery eyes diminish, it did not address the issue of respiratory difficulties.  I found that it may have even increased my respiratory symptoms in this process.

3434	tazorac	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne/anti-agin	This drug did, in fact, erradicate the adult acne I'd been plagued with since turning 29.  I didn't have awful acne, but it was persistent.	When I first began using the product I suffered serious side effects, especially to my neck.  My face became very, very dry and red, and it hurt.  After several weeks of toughing it out, I ended up skipping a nightly dose, and I think that helped.  It allowed my skin to recover a bit so that when I got back on the reginme the following night, I didn't suffer quite as badly.  From that time on, my neck just itched . . . and itched . . . and itched.  After about two weeks, though, my skin acclimated fully.	I was instructed by my dermatologist to wash my face nightly with a benign cleanser, wait twenty to thirty minutes, and then apply a very light film of product to my face and neck.  Be careful not to apply the product directly up against the side of the nose or the nostrils, or you'll suffer irritation.

The retail theft occured while on just 5 mg of abilify. It effected my judgement/reasoning skills because I did not tell my doctor & allowed him to continue to increase dosage up to 15mg when I became expremely restless. Could not set down, paced for hours & called my doctor about this. Also during the 2 months I was taking this drug I charged a little over 15,000 on my credit cards that had no balance on them previously. If one did it was under $300. I still am currently unemployed & am having difficulty finding employement as a RN, due to my criminal record within the last year. If I had problems before taking antipsychotics, they were nothing compared to what I have now.	I am only taking ativan & getting psychological therapy & trying to get out of the legal mess the drugs seroquel & abilify caused me. It definitely made my life now & in the future much, much worse.

Several years ago a new doctor wanted to change me to Trileptal.  The experience was not good - a major seizure while he was experimenting with the dosage; dizzy spells came over me in the morning, sometimes during my commute.  Later the doctor switched to Lamictal.  I have been on Lamictal for several years now with no seizures and no side effects, with the occasional 'aura' (something like a headache that in the past has sometimes been a precursor to a seizure).

I had slept wrong one night and caused major inflamation in my neck muscles. Nothing helped; massage, Tylenol, etc. This did work. It allowed me to sleep without pain and eventually my neck just healed itself.
29	alprazolam	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	panic disorder, agoraphobia	Helped me be able to leave the house for the first time in months, quickly reduced my anxiety and I didn't have any attacks.	Barely any despite some slight confusion.	"This medication (and other benzodiazepines) has gotten a bad reputation because some irresponsible people have ruined it for those that actually need it. If people would take this drug as prescribed, there would not be as many problems and it wouldn't carry the stigma it does now.

I started having panic attacks when I turned 21, and the condition soon worsened into full-blown panic disorder. A year later, I couldn't hold down a job and was agoraphobic. I tried counseling and medications like Zoloft and Lexapro. The side effects from those made me feel worse than I did just not taking them.

Finally my doctor decided to put me on Alprazolam as-needed. 

It has been a life-saver for me. I would take the lowest dose (0.25 mg), and be able to leave my house for the first time in months. I visited friends, went to restaurants, and did everything I used to do before my disorder. I finally felt like I had my life back. I would take one whenever I anticipated a situation where I could have an attack, or when I felt one coming on already. Sometimes I didn't even need all of the 0.25 mg and could break it in half. 

Too many people abuse this medication by upping their dosage without a doctor's consent or using it when they don't need to, and now you are almost treated like a criminal at some pharmacies and doctor's offices when they learn you are taking it because they think you are a druggie.

I *much* prefer this medication over any of the SSRIs, which have horrible side effects. I felt like a zombie on those medications, had no sex drive at all, and didn't have any energy whatsoever. The doctors tell you those side effects will go away with use, but for days to even weeks you feel 10 times worse than you did before. It's just not worth it.

0.25 mg of Alprazolam as-needed for anxiety has helped me get my life back on track and really helped save me from spending days and nights locked away in my house. I highly recommend this medication for responsible people who just need something in a crutch and don't want to go on long-term SSRIs that leave you feeling drained and lifeless.

Yes, counseling and therapy are a better alternative to medication, but the problem is always finding a *good* counselor, and sometimes even then, they just don't work. I have seen 3 counselors and all of them have failed to help me with anything, all I did was waste a $20 copay each visit to have them tell me things that sounded like they came from an inspirational booklet. 

Taken *as* prescribed or as-needed, this drug is wonderful."
2262	lexapro	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	I felt less sadness.	i felt less of every emotion.  i felt emotionally flat.  Slept a lot.  When I wasn't sleeping, I really could not even have driven a car.  Made me a zombie.	I took a whole 10 mg tablet the first time and I wasn't right for two days.  I then took just a quarter of a 10 mg tablet and got the same reaction, but it only lasted for about a day. I was through with it a that point.
4013	celexa	3	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression and anxiety	Worked to well	dry mouth, tired throughout the day, yawning, lack of wanting to go out.	I was on 20mg celexa for about 6 months,  Ive suffered with depression and anxiety for some time now.  I was on wellbutrin for 2 years and loved it, but doesnt help much with anxiety, just more of depression.  So i tried celexa and loved it initially, but i guess you can say that i dint like it because it worked too well!  I completely changed.  I didnt care much about going out or what people and friends thought about me.  Im a contractor and started to get a feeling of not wanting to go on lots of bids or work long hours like i use to want to...which caused a big drop in income.  Paying bills at the last secound, started smoking again etc. I just had that 'i dont give a shyt about anything' attitude. For me this drug completely changed me for the worst.  Back on welbutrin again and feels great!

Gradual relief from severe TMJ and tension that began to feel like being frozen solid. Relief from restless leg syndrome. Ability to relax gradually over time. Relief from chattering teeth.	none really.	For years, after some kind of nerve damage after a spinal tap, I would start to have small seizures every time I would begin to relax. (GETTING TENSE DIDN'T HELP EITHER ;-) I had trouble laying quietly, let alone sleeping. My teeth chattered and my legs twitched like crazy and there was a very painful weak spot in my lower back. I still have the painful weak spot and pretty severe migraines, but this drug was a quality of life saver. When I took it at the same time as Topomax it was ESPECIALLY effective. I take 2 mg at night before bed, and sometimes another .5 or 1 mg during the day if symptoms were bad. It's exhausting to never be able to relax.

300	vivelle	6	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	total hist	Decreased hot flashes, minimal mood swing and axiety.	Severe appetite loss and some weight loss.	Ive been on the Vivelle patch about 3 month's now. Prior to the patch I was on a sublinqual tablet but that wasnt working so I tried the patch. Te only side affect fromthe patch is severe appetite loss. Some days I have no desire to eat at all not even a craving. This is starting to concern me considering that I'm not trying to loose weight at all. Ive lost about 3 pounds already and about 115 pounds at 5ft tall so this is a problem. Wondering if anyone else has experianced this and have any suggestions? Spoke with the pharmacist and he stated that it may go away but try it for another month. He didnt sound to sure about it either.
3303	zoloft	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"After about two weeks of being on the medicine, I started to feel a little better but I think it takes awhile for it to really kick in. The medicine has helped me by the following:

2268	lexapro	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression/anxiety	Lexapro worked very well to make me feel better, less anxious and unhappy.	I gained ten pounds in the few months that I took this medicine.	"I've taken several anti-depressants over the years trying to find something with the least side effects for me. Paxil caused my jaw to always clench, Prozac caused heart flutters.

My doctor was very insistant that Lexapro was not the cause of my weight gain. However, I insisted on trying something else (Wellbutrin). Within 2 months I had lost the aberrant 10 pounds."

Sun sensitivity, sensitivity of the skin, dehydration, tightness - they disappear after several months of constant use.	2-3 times x week
2320	lexapro	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Taking Lexapro has become a staple in my life.  I come from an extremely depressed family history including suicide in the family and extreme bi-polar disorder in my father.  Without some kind of anti-depressant I literally cannot sleep at night due to low positive brain chemicals causing me to wake every few hours and have a very hard time falling asleep.  Therefore I take 15 mg prophylactically of Lexapro long-term.  I would rather not be on anything at all but unfortunately have tried that in the past without success.  I do think this drug can be very good if it helps you, though it is not a cure all by any means.	The side effects for me included slightly lowered sex drive but not completely gone and climax is still possible.  I am drowsier on this drug than I was before and have lost some of my motivation regarding goals and dreams.  However, it is worth it to also lose the insomnia and crying spells.	I have tried 20 mg per day in divided doses (10 mg a.m. and 10 mg before bed at night) as well as 15 mg per day administered once in the morning.  I prefer the 15 mg although the 20 does work a little better as long as I divide the doses.  I am staying at 15 because I would like to take as small a dose as possible while still managing my depression symptoms.  I was happier overall on 20 mg however.  Oddly enough, taking 20 mg once in the morning rather than divided into a.m. and p.m. seemed to make my depression worse and I found myself crying more.  All in all the best for me is 20 mg with half in the morning and half at night.  However, for long term use I prefer to take 15 mg just once per day at night.

I was being treated for adult rheumatic fever with antibiotics and steroids and paxil.  I had a very hard time coming off of the paxil and I was very uncomfortable on it. The mental benefit was not worth the physical detriment.

Was having a weight issue, and with a blood test it was determined that the thyroid gland was ""sluggish"".  I was very exhausted also and it has helped somewhat with fatigue."	dosing is extremely important as it takes many blood tests to determine correct dosage.  Not having the dosage quite right will basically result in the same symptoms that you are having issues with.  I have suffered basically no significant side effects other than that.	Pill is taken early in the morning on an empty stomach.  It is basically prescription iodine as hypothyroidism is basically an iodine deficiency.  Symptoms that I experienced were basically weight gain and extreme fatigue.  It's taken awhile to get the dosage correct, and after switching pharmacies and getting a different drug manufactured by another company, I feel that maybe another blood test is necessary to confirm that the new pills are as effective as the others I had been taking for 5 years.

3941	prilosec	6	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	heartburn	It reduced the amount of acid that my stomach produced and therefore allowed my stomach and esophagus to heal to some degree. I also took it for years to control my regular acid reflux problems.	I developed joint pains and arthritis as well as constipation, stomach aches, and overall reduced health.	Eventually my body was so used to the Prilosec that it was almost impossible to get off. My body was working very hard to produce enough acid for protein digestion that whenever I stopped taking Prilosec there would be a huge backlash of extreme acid production.

349	neurontin	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	perepheral neuropathy	BENRFITS OF TREATMENT: Unsure - My legs ache. I don't remember ever having any real pain, other than an annoying ache in both legs. I feel as though I am walking in wet fishing boots.  There is a buzzing in my legs and feet. It has over the past several years crept up from my ankles to above my knees. With all this I do very well walking a slow pace - sometimes like a drunken Sailor. I walk down 101 stairs  tale a short walk and come back up 2 at a time (slowly) holding onto a rail (now).	Side Effects:: Memory and problem solving - Constant tiredness, lack of interest. Hard to concentrate on necessary Paperwork - i.e. Taxes (TurboTax) Last year I had no problem with concentrating or filling in the forms on the program. Now I have a hard time even sitting down to do it. I was motivated - now I've lost the drive to get the job done - and I know I have to do it. I have trouble understanding.

1956	lyrica	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	fibromyalgia	None!	"I was extremely tired both 1 month times I tried this! I already was tired from FMS and this more than doubled. I had no relief of aches or pain! Nothing! But, I wanted to try it the second time just to be sure.

Well, I am going to try it again. Gluton for punishment? NO! I want to find something to HELP Me! I want a better life without pain or less pain. But I don't want to be so tired I go from the couch to the bed all day long. 

This Fibromyalgia was a blow to My active life and I want it back!!  So I'll write another review after this 3rd try of Lyrica!!"	See above
2724	elavil	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	insomnia - early awakening	restful sleep	carbohydrate cravings leading to overeating and overweight.  I also tended to always needto increase the dose over the years. When I started using this drug, I was given a 50mg dose hs.  I developed a tolerance and the dose needed to be increased until it reached 300mg.	I was refered to a pharmacology specialist to see how I could be weaned off such a large dose in order to help control my weight because of the triggering of the carbohydrate cravings for which elavil is well known for.  I have partiall been switched to topamax( 150mg hs with 225mg elavil hs) and I almost immediately lost 15lbs)
549	aloprim	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	gout	I would get painful swelling in my feet.  I could not even stand the bed sheet to touch my feet.  One time while on vacation I was swollen up to my knees.  The medication makes my life easier.  I don't have to worry that when I wake up I won't be able to walk around my house.  I rarely have any slight indication that the gout is going to be a problem.	None that I have noticed. I used to have painful swelling regularly and now I don't.	I just take one pill per day.  I take it every day as a prevention.  I think it controls the uric acid my body produces  too much of that causes the fluid retention and the swelling.
1791	citalopram	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	I felt that i did not feel any benefits from this drug.	I felt more anxious than before starting on this medication, these effects lasted about ten days, i began having headaches which lasted about a week. I carried on taking citalopram for six weeks with no benefit, so my doctor increased the dose to 40mg daily. Four weeks later i decided to stop this medication as I felt like a zombie, as though my thoughts were on a go slow. I quit there and then, which i know is not advisable, but I just wanted to get this drug out of my system. The worst withdrawl symptom I had was the strange dreams/nightmares. I will never forget them, they were so vivid and funnily enough i had not had (remembered) any dreams for the previous five years.	Starting dose 20mg daily. Increased to 40mg daily after initial six weeks.
1498	metrogel	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	rosacea	Sometimes lessoned redness	burning sensation on occasion	Several years ago I was diagnosed with rosacea.  Metrogel was prescribed by my family doctor.  At the time I had oily skin.  It was prescribed to be used 2 times a day.  I was also told to use Cetaphil cleanser.  My rosacea symptoms were redness, burning skin that felt hot to the touch.  I used the Metrogel religiously as prescribed.  For the first 2 weeks, it burned on contact.  I hated it.  After awhile my skin started calming down and I stopped using the Metrogel.  Everytime my skin flared up I would use it again.  I'm using it right now.  I can't really say if the Metrogel helped at all.  Sometimes I think it is very irritating but I'm told to use it when necessary. Redness is sometimes better after use, but I don't know if it the result of the Metrogel.  I would like to find something better out there.
228	wellbutrin-xl	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	elevation of mood and clarity of thought.  Progress stalled out at 300 mg, but with increase to 450 mg can tell the difference.  I'm able to finally think and plan ahead and chip away at all the clutter I've not been able to deal with which accumulated while depressed.	none at 300 mg.  Possible tinnitus from increase to 450 mg, not evaluated by an audiologist yet though.  Did experience weight loss (7 lbs.) at 450 mg dosage.	Inital treatment included therapy and Lexapro in addition to Wellbutrin XL.  Now only on the Wellbutrin XL.  I see the psychiatrist every 4 months for re-evaluation.
37	zyprexa	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	agitation management r/t lewy body syndrome  demen	The Zyprexa minimized agitative outbursts	"The pt developed severe ""gait freezing"" , gait shuffling, severe muscle weakness, and gereral stupor"	Since many of these s/s are also s/s of the disease-Lewy Body Syndrome Demenia, it took research and experimentation by me and the MD to realize that it was the med adn not the disease in this case.  The pt has been taken off the drug and no longer has these pronounced s/s.
1558	methotrexate	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	rhematory arthritis	This drug definitely helped control flares and joint stiffness. It also helped defeat the incredible amount of hives. Hives were completely controlled.	Unfortunately, there were many side effects such as diarrhea, nausea, occasional vomiting, extreme fatigue, foggy mind. Bruising at the injection site was also very common.	One injection every week.
4125	chantix	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	smoking cessation	Loss of the desire to smoke and eventually the cessation of smoking altogether.	Fatigue and gas.	Literature says that desire to smoke should cease after 2 weeks.  It took about 3 1/2 for me.  Chantix effectively helped me quit smoking without horrible withdrawals and side effects.  It has been 1 year and 4 months now.  I am completely free of cigarettes now.  Chantix was the only thing that helped.
2061	prempro	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	menopause	daily hot flashes and night sweats are much less severe if any at all. sleep is less distrubed and mood swings are much less. i no longer feel enraged when i wake in the morning.  Depression is gone and i feel less tired (probably because i get more sleep).	none	prempro has saved my life
1284	provigil	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety and to avoid feeling misrable	none	stomach bloating,tired feeling,hallucination and no sound sleep	"I have been using modafinil since 5 days, 100mg for 3 days and 200 mg for 2 days along with citalopram 15(mg) as prescribed by my doc.Initially for 3 days (when I was on 100mg) it was ok,just slight irritability.But after taking 200mg felt the following-:

1.)Tired never before after 5hours

2.)Then began hallucination,felt like I am dreaming

3.) I became anxious,irritable and jittery feeling overcame me.

4.)Stomach bloating was so high that it bothered my heart a lot.

5.)Coudn't get a sound sleep.


Not sure whether this happened because of modafinil alone or the mixing of citalopram and modafinil. But it sure did bother me."
235	wellbutrin-xl	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Greatly benefitted depression. I started to take this just before my child was born, having had post partum depression with another baby, and I was anticipating my life to be at least as hectic, if not more hectic, when this child was born as when the older child was born. I was very  pleased with the antidepressant effects. I never experienced any depression at all once this baby was born. I did not experience hypomania like I did with sertraline, which was a huge concern of mine. I just did not become depressed when this baby was born.	Wellbutrin can make me feel anxious, which is why I have a prescription for clonazepam whenever I am taking wellbutrin. The worst side effect was the cost. I have no health insurance and wellbutrin xl is very expensive. I did not notice weight loss, as some others have, nor did I ever notice an increase in my libido. I tolerated it very well.	"I started to take wellbutrin xl at about six months of pregnancy and continued for approx six months, when the baby was about three months old. I usually took it in the morning, but often times forgot and took it later in the day. None of this seemed to affect how well it worked. Were it not for the fact that it is so expensive and that it can be toxic to the body, I would take it every day.

4065	mobic	6	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	arthritis/knee pain	"quite effective without the adverse effects of aspirin, naproxin etc.
because of the reported side effects of cox2  meds i take as little as possible to maintain a reletively comfortable exixtence"	only side effect was  sore tummy on the odd occasion i took it without food	i take 1x 7.5 tablet every other day plus omega 3/6/9 and halibut liver oil caps and walk as much as possible. I only resort to 1 tablet daily if knee is really bad. 15mg daily and i am pain free but i am not prepared to risk the side effects on an otherwise healthy  body
2531	lamisil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	fungal growth on feet	After having tried several over the counter treatments for this condition, this treatment was the only one that effectively treated the condition.  The itching and discoloration began to dissipate after a few days and symptoms were completely gone after two weeks.	none	As recommended by my doctor I continued the treatment for two weeks after the symptoms had disappeared.  The cream was applied liberally to affected areas twice a day.  I would recommend this treatment to anyone with persistent fugal skin growth.
3885	abilify	6	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	I've only been on it for a week but I've noticed a change already. I am more awake and it seems as though a fog has been lifted. I am thinking more clearly and don't feel so down.	None so far.	My doctor added Abilify to my 60 mg of Cymbalta because I was feeling really fatigued and unable to function.
1230	ultracet	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	herniated disk in my lower back	reduces pain	constipation, high feeling, loss of mental skills. I had a minor operation on my foot and sufered a servere reaction to the anesthesia. they could not wake me up for 2 days. during this time i also had seizures.	i began using this medication for back pain over a year ago.
137	valtrex	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	cold sores	It definitely reduced the size and severity of the cold sore but now I get the more frequently.  Like twice a month!!	ocassional diarrhea and headache.	I began getting cold sores about 5 years ago, when I was 35.  I would get them 3-4 times per year, especially when the weather changed.  My doctor prescribed me a 1mg tablet to take 2 of them in the morning and 2 at night at the onset of a cold sore.  It helped but the sore still ran its ugly course, even if I caught it right at the tingling point before it came out.  When I was 38, I went on birth control.  After about a year of being on Yaz, I began getting cold sores EVERY MONTH!  I told my doctor but she didn't think it was from the birth control - even though I read that BC suppresses your immune system, and anything that does that can allow for more instances of cold sores.  I went off the Yaz for 2 months, and STILL got cold sores during those two months.  So maybe she was right.  She then prescribed Valtrez 500mg once per day and I've been taking that since 9/09.  Still, like clockwork I get a cold sore every single month.  Either right before during or after my period.  So I think it's hormonal.  something is triggering them every month.  I've changed my diet completely, I take 4,000mg of Lsyine each day, I've tried the Red Marine Algae also.  No difference.  I'm a high stress personality anyway which doesn't help.  My doctor prescribed a mild sedative just to take the edge off and it does work great.  But still, the cold sores come like clockwork.  I just don't get it.  I'm starting a new job soon where I'll actually have to go to an office each day.  for the last 10 years I've been a road warrior, so I've been able to get around having to see people by making my own hours, especially if a cold sore errupts.  Now I don't know what I'll do.  It scares me and I'm stressed over that as well which doesn't help.  I feel plagued!  I don't know what else to try.  Maybe Acyclovir?
2445	wellbutrin-sr	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	It greatly helped with my depression which was caused by a divorce after 28 years of marriage. 3 months after my separation my Father died and my Mother became very angry and unresponsive with me.When I started taking this medication I was able to focus better at work and at home I was able to effectively deal with my emotions, I also experienced an increase in my libido. I am still currently taking the generic form of Wellbutrin SR (Bupropion).	I took Wellbetrin XL for a little while, but I didn't like it because I felt like my emotions were on a rollercoaster ride. I went back to the generic form of Wellbutrin SR and I felt better, I would like to try the name brand of Wellbutrin since I have heard that it is actually better than the generic.I don't recall any bad side effects,except a little dry mouth.	I take 1 tablet in the morning an 1 tablet at night everyday. When I am able to afford it I intend to try the brand name of this product to see if it will help with my libido now since I have had a hysterectomy and am experiencing low libido, weight gain, and depression of a different kind than I experienced in the beginning.
3606	retin-a	3	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	acne	I saw almost no benefits to this treatment with re: acne, though possibly there was exfoliation or collagen benefit. I believe it exacerbated my acne. On the mornings after the nights I used the cream, my acne seemed to come out much worse (particularly on the chin & jaw area where the condition was the worst).	"Side effects included:
- Stinging & pain
- Peeling
- Pinkness (exacerbated rosacea)"	"The cream was supposed to minimize my acne, but I think it did the opposite. Just putting the cream on was very painful & stung up front. 

At times, my face would peel for entire days (again primarily on the chin - or entire jawline area). 

As I saw it, the Retin A reacted negatively with whatever hormonal issue was causing the acne. 

I was forced to use injestable treatments, because Retin A did not work (antibiotics and birth control)."
353	neurontin	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	nerve damage	at the highest dosage, the generic, gabapentin, seemingly reduced nerve pain resulting from Peripheral Neuropathy following surgery to remove neuromas in both feet (although it is a very subjective pain, which is affected by other factors: tension, sitting for prolonged periods, etc.)	after taking the highest dosage for a period of 1 year or so, the medication seems to have dried out and damaged my hair, and made my skin significantly drier and scalier.	started at 300mg/day, gradually increased to 3600.  have since tapered off to 1200.
446	lorazepam	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	panic attacks	i could control my panic and knew i could. therefore, just having lorazepam with me was often enough. over the years, my attacks diminished, first in severity, then in quantity.	drowsiness. i couldn't take it and then be expected to work. this could get tricky.	one half to one pill at the first feelings of panic. better to let it absorb through the tongue for faster results.
3542	vivelle-dot	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hysterectomy	The treatment benefits was estrogen replacement.  This estrogen patch system significatly reduced my headaches.  Estrogen is not processed through the liver when delivered via a patch, therefore reducing hormone induced migrains.  I felt normal for the first time in years after my hysterectomy.  I love this medication.	The only side effect I have experienced is that the patch leaves sticky stuff on your skin.  The adhesive can be very difficult to remove.	Vivelle Dot is an Estrogen replacement patch that is placed on the abdomen every 3 1/2 days. It comes in several dose strengths.  It has significantly reduced my headaches due to hormone replacement.  He is also great for people who have trouble remembering to take a daily pill.  I highly recommend this product.
2297	lexapro	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression, lack of motivation	My obsessive thoughts completely disappeared. This was a huge relief because before that I was comparing myself to others 24/7. I was able to handle stressful situations calmly. Nothing could make me upset.	I did not gain or loose weight. My sex drive became non-existent. I was no longer able to achieve orgasm. This really became an issue only when my dose was increased from 10 mg to 20 mg. Ultimately, I stopped the pill because of this. Now, I am starting again (only 10 mg/day) because I am so lethargic, depressed, and full of obsessive thoughts.	My dose was increased from 10 mg to 20 mg after about 2 months. I took the 20 mg dose for one month but then I abruptly stopped because of the side effects. I did not have any problem stopping the pill (no withdrawal symptoms at all). My sex drive and the ability to orgasm came back.
2823	wellbutrin	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety/ mild depression	"increased energy. better focus. better sex drive. more ""alive"" than when only taking lexapro and loestrin."	dry mouth. for 1st couple of weeks, became VERY jittery after drinking coffee (this has stopped).	"i'd been on lexapro for about a year. my nephew (national guardsman) was killed 
in afghanistan... horrible details... negated good results of lexapro, so doctor prescribed wellbutrin/ generic bupropion. i tried to wean myself off of lexapro last month, but original panic attacks returned, so am back to the combination. am experiencing good effects."
836	relafen	5	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sciatica	The only benefit I received from this drug was the ability to get through my day without experiencing unbearable pain. My sciatica was not a condition that flared up continually; rather, it came approximately 4-6 times per month.	"Excessive sleepiness, lack of concentration, feelings similar to those that one would experience taking oxycodone.  I felt ""high"" for many hours after taking this drug."	"The plan was a permanent solution to my occasional flare-ups of sciatica.  My physician basically stated that there was no cure for my pain; therefore, I needed to be placed on a prescription regimen that would hopefully reduce the occurrence and/or frequency of sciatica.  Each bottle contained a 60 day supply with enough refills to last me an entire year.  I have 2 herniated discs, one at L4-L5 and the other at S1.  The herniation at L4-L5 was causing pressure on my sciatic nerve which runs down the length of the left leg.  For me, this drug was not effective; perhaps, if I had continual pain I would learn to live with the side-effects.  I did stop taking any medications for my condition and am learning to cope without prescriptions at this time.  It appears that eventually I will need to take medication but I want to avoid feeling ""doped up"" for as long as possible."
860	valium	6	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	It was beneficial for alleviating nervousness and feelings of anxiety. I took one half tablet or a full tablet depending upon how anxious or nervous I was feeling. If particularly anxious/nervous sometimes I took one tablet plus a half. I didn't take this medication on a daily basis, but only when I was going to be involved in a nerve wracking experience.	Only mild slightly woozy feelings. Exacerbated when I took higher dose of 1 & 1/2 tablets	This medication was prescribed to calm feelings of anxiety and nervousness that I experienced in certain social situations.
1843	yasmin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	birth control	I've been on yasmin four years now, it works so great! I have no side effects, just nausea if I take two at a time and that is hardly ever.  But my acne completely went away and no pregnancy the whole time I've been on it! Would definently recommend to anybody.	None	.
2572	klonopin	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	tia type seizures, stress	None.  I went from 140lbs down to 98lbs.  I did have reoccuring episodes (TIA like - diagnosed as TIA for lack of conclusive evidence or further investigation)  I now believe it was mostly stress and menopause related issues.	I do not know that all side effects were attributable to the Clonozapam alone or a combination of one or all drugs.  I did take just the Clonozapm and Lovastatin the first year.   Regardless, everytime I looked up a symptom on the web, it always pointed to MS.  My Neurologist did say we should investigate it, but we never did.  Anyway, I could not sleep for days on end, I had excessive hand tremors, voice tremors, unsteady gait, tintinnitus, eyesight problems, urinary problems, memory problems and a bunch more I can't even recall at the moment.  I weaned myself off the medicine in 3 months time and am very much improved but only after months and possibly years of being removed from all the problems.  I'd like to mention that at one point in time I took the cholesterol drug that Dr. Jarvis promotes...I can't remember the name and had to quit within the first week as it gave me pains in the front of my thighs that could take your breath away.  I know for a fact that that symptom was in fact attributable to that drug.  A good effect that came from that drug though was the almost immediate shrinkage of my breast cysts...I had many on both sides.  Upon starting on that drug, I could actually feel them draining, dissapating or whatever you might call it.  They have not returned, so I am very thankful for that aspect of the drug.  Because of the leg pain though, I found it intolerable.	I am not sure what you mean as I already told you that I was being treated for TIA like seizures with the Clonozapam and Aggrenox as a blood thinner for the same.  I also took Lovastatin for High Cholesterol.  In the course of all these medications I ended up getting a divorce.  The drugs did not lower my cholesterol... they made me more nervous and made me question what on earth was wrong with me?  I now weigh more than I ever have, and I started to gain wieght almost immediately after getting off of the drugs.  I could use to lose 20lbs, but I am not worried about it as I am so much healthier than I was during the time I was on all of the drugs.  I hope this has helped you in some way.  I am sorry that I can't be more specific, but I am in a hurry to put all of that behind me and build a healthier - drug free future.  I am very much a proponent of natural medicines these days!
4037	tri-luma	2	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	dark skin spots on face	slight lightening of dark spots. there was really no benefit beyond this.  seems like a waste of time and in fact, just regularly applying sunscreen seems to do a better job of lightening the spots	redness and irritation. increased sensitivity to sun exposure.  but only after about 30 days of applications or so	applied light amount once a day at night before bed
1276	provigil	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	fatigue	Was often so tired that I barely got through my work day and would go home and sleep.  My quality of life was pretty much non-existant as I didn't enjoy anthing because I was always too tired.  When I started provigil I quit feeling like I always needed a nap and was able to make plans with friends because I had the energy to do more than just get through 9 to 11 hour work days.	No negative side effects	Was prescribed 100 mg and could go up to 200 mg as needed.  On a regular day 100 mg was sufficient.  On long days or if I had activities schduled after work I would take another 100 mg tablet or I'd cut a tablet in half to take 50 mg rather than 100 .  I made sure I didn't take anymore after about 6:00 pm or it would keep me awake at night.
2945	mirapex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	restless legs syndrome	My legs used to jump pretty badly and so did my arms every night about 60 times per hour, that's once a minute.  Sometimes it would wake me up and other times I didn't even know I was doing it, but the doctor told me that it was still disturbing my sleep.  While taking this drug, my legs and arms only jumped about 3 times in a 6 hr period.  All documented on sleep studies.	I've heard that some people turn into gamblers.  Not a joke.  But I have never had any abnormal urges to gamble while taking it.  I am not a gambling person. In fact the medication has never made me want to do anything wrong or strange and I've never had trouble or side effects at all unless I suddenly stop taking it and then I can't sit still or sleep becuase I am jumping around.	I take a .25mg tablet every a.m. and then around dinner I take another one.  This keeps me from becoming jumpy in the daytime because I used to just be sitting there and my arm or leg would fly up or I'd feel the need to move.  I also take 1 mg at bedtime to stop my legs and arms from jumping in my sleep.  This has improved my quality of sleep immensely.
1019	vyvanse	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	add	Helps with concentration and staying focused. Helps to keep me from being hyperactive and fidgety and helps with memory to an extent.	If I am stressed, I seem to be jittery and the benefits are not as prominent.	I was diagnosed with ADD three years ago. Have tried several different prescriptions and found the best results from Adderall and Vyvanse.
3446	provera	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	irregular menses	The treatment benefits of taking Provera were very good. I had very irregular menses that lasted for long periods of time.  By taking the Provera day 15-26 of my cycle my periods began to normalize and become regular again.	The only side effects I noticed were during the first two days or so of taking Provera I was more tired than usual.  I also noticed I felt more bloated than when I was not taking it.	On day 15 of my cycle I took the Provera 10 mg for 12 days and then stopped to promote a period.  It took a couple of cycles for this to become effective, but utilizing the drug in this manner did take care of the problem of irregular bleeding in between periods.
1409	adipex-p	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	weightloss	Upon first taking the medication it significantly reduced my hunger almost to the point that I had to remind myself to eat during the day.  It also gave me alot of energy so working out didn't seem like such a chore anymore.  I felt more refreshed and awake in the morning instead of wanting to hit the snooze button over and over.	At first when I started the phentermine, it made me very thirsty and a little bit jittery but that wore off after about a week.  I also had trouble falling asleep at first if I didn't take the medication early enough in the morning and woke up quite a bit throughout the night. These side effects all diminished after about a month of usage.	First I had to fill out a patient questionaire & submit blood for some blood work that was required.  I was prescribed to take one pill after breakfast in the morning. I also went in for weekly weigh ins and measurements.   They also gave me some vitamins to take along with the phentermine but I did not take those since I hate having to take any kind of pills.  Overall I am very happy with the results achieved from taking phentermine and occasionally take them when I feel myself getting off track again.
1273	provigil	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	shift work insomnia	I couldn't tolerate the side effects, so I was unable to experience the benefits.	I experienced severe flew like symptoms and severe headaches that worsened with each dose.	I was only on this medication for a very short time because after 3 days my doctor took me off of it.
3312	zoloft	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	resolved depression within one week. I was told it did not work that fast, but I know it did. It is	None. I have not had any effects from the drug other than stopping the depression.	I take it most days. At times I have stopped taking it for 30-50 days and the depression returns. I believe it is good to occasionally stop the medicine to be sure it is still needed.
3052	seroquel	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar	Seroquel provides a good night sleep, which is very important for mood stabilization. It also helps to calm, and smooth over the rough spots of daily living, while not robbing you of your personality, ie, you still feel like yourself, just calmer.	slight weight gain, and a bit(not too much) sleepier.	Seroquel at night for sleep and mood stabilization
2644	aldara	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	scar revision surgery	aldara was used on several areas on my face where i had scar revision surgery to help heal surgical wound on face.  It was prescribed by my doctor to speed up healing.	there was reddening, thickening of the area the medication was placed. some peeling and itching occurred at the wound treated.	to put aldara on the surgical wounds 3 x per week for 8 hours at nite. treatment began immediately after the surgery and was used while the stitches were still in...the stitches were removed after one week and treatment with aldara continued.
2751	xenical	6	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	weight loss	The treatment benefits was a minimal weight loss, but not nearly as much as I expected.	I mainly experienced the following side effects: diarrhea, stomach cramps, indigestion, flatulence, oily stool, defecation urgency.	I think is a good medication if you follow a good planned diet, but don't expect to loose too much weight if you only take the pill and don't cut your calories or exercise more often.
3386	baclofen	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	Helped with sleep. Could reduce valium, trazadone without withdrawal symptoms	A little drooziness in AM	Was looking for another drug without as much addiction potential for life long sleep disorder. Found this through a friend, there are posts on the internet about it, also used for addictions off label. My MD agreed to try it.
3755	spironolactone	5	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	acne	Overall reduction in the severity of breakouts.	Extreme fatigue. For the first week I became so tired that immediately after coming from work I'd go to bed. I cut back to one pill a day and have greatly improved. Haven't had the nerve to work back to 2 pills a day due to the last reaction.	Take one pill after dinner. Wash face with medicated facewash. Use Retin-A micro in conjunction with spironolactane.
2810	wellbutrin	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Medication helped with depression, my irritable bowel syndrome, appetite control, and there were no sexual side effects	dry mouth, difficulty sleeping	I was treated for several years with the above medication, it worked better than anything I had tried. I was able to taper off the medication--NEVER quit abruptly--and have been doing fine. I began running to help with the depression and IBS and, in my opinion, it works very well. I still have times of irritability, but that's normal life, right?
1358	crestor	2	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	high cholesterol and triglycerides (21.1!)	cholesterol and trigl. went down	after 1 year severe pain/cramps in the feet (plantar fasciitis), over the 2 years about 20 kg weight gain, after 2 years very swollen legs: lymph oedema and now (2 1/2 years) i can hardly walk, so much pain in lower legs, lower back. I stopped with crestor and after 1 week; no more leg pain, i can walk again, no more tight feelings in my feet. NO MORE CRESTOR!	"used tablets for 2 1/2 years, did not realise that the cramps after 1 year could be a side effect so i kept on taking the tablets, still didn't realize it when i got these enormous swollen legs. 
By the way Ezetrol gives me dizzyness (vertigo) so I chucked him away too."

4115	chantix	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	smoking cessation	Eliminated nicotine cravings and made smoking cessation very easy.	Slight stomach naseau if not taken with food.	I set my quit date for 1 week after I started taking the medication, but did not get discouraged when I was unable to meet that goal because I noticed a drastic decrease in my cravings and knew that I could eventually beat this addiction with the help of Chantix. I reset my quit day for 1 week beyond my original date and by my second quit date, I was no longer craving a cigarette. I was able to quit smoking after only 2 weeks on the medication. I no longer craved one when I woke up, after I ate or when I got in my car. It was amazing and I like to call this my little miracle drug. =)
2626	depo-provera	1	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	contraception	I did not get pregnant while on the depo shot... but then again my sex life was shot due to the constant bleeding.	Side effects were horrific. I gained weight, developed horrible acne, and i was severely depressed the entire time. When choosing the depo shot i was excited to not have to worry about taking the pill, lightening or stopping my periods, and the guaruntee of contraception. Boy was i wrong. All of the previous side effects were bad enough, but after the first month on the shot, i continued to have my period for nearly 2 months straight. for some reason my period never stopped. The worst part about this contraceptive is that once you take the shot, there is no going back. I highly recommend a different birth control. I am now on the nuvaring and so far i am pleased with the results. Mild nausea at night the first week but that is my only complaint. Much better choice if you are looking to avoid pills. :)	I recieved the shot at family planning about 3 years ago. Please do yourself a favor and look to other options before choosing this drug. My experience was the hardest 3 months of my life both emotionally and physically.
53	flexeril	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	muscle spasms	I am able to get good restful sleep and that is so important in my pain management.	Sever tiredness, not able to leave the house after taking the medicine.	Pain management, I take one to two pills a day as needed.
4101	chantix	2	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	smoking	It seemed to help make me not want to smoke. I seemed to not even think about smoking at times i would normally smoke. I think it would be very efective if the side effects werent so great.	I felt weird, hard to describe, but not like myself.I couldnt sleep, I had weird vivid dreams, nauseated for about an hour after taking pill.	I quit taking this med after about  a week and i am now still smoking.
3779	metronidazole	10	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	tooth abscess	"Personally, i found metronidazole to be an equivalent to a concentration drug, it severely improved my intelligence and my overall concentration, i realise now that this drug, as it may be depressing, a new chapter in my life.

during the medication i received, i was severely depressed, however it got me thinking deeply towards why i was indeed depressed, and thus, i came to a solution.

it completely destroyed the bacteria that was within my abscess and treated me within 3 days, and aided my mind alot.

Within my experience with metronidazole, i have only to thank it for my A* papers and my mental health.

With that i have only this to say:
Take it, it aids the physical problems you have, and if your like me at all, with greater ambitions than any human can dream,  This will make you realise all the problems you encounter, and it will cleanse you of your worries."	The side effects are the same as the benefits to me.	"400 MG 3 Times DAILY

3899	dispermox	3	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	tonsillitis/strep throat	Cured the tonsilitis/strep throat	Vaginal Yeast Infection, itchy red rash over entire body except face. Arms and legs had the most severe rash.	Instructed to take two 250mg capsules every 8 hrs for 10 days. No discussion about possible side effects or what to do should they occur. I thought my skin had come into contact with something that I was allergic to because I didn't realize it was a drug reaction since that rash started on the 8th day antibiotics.
795	ambien	7	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	restless sleep	Is very helpful with insomnia.  Was able to put racing thoughts that run threw my mind at rest.  Was able to get into a deep sleep.	Could still wake up in  middle of the night and not be able to fall back asleep. I would sometimes fell groggy in the morning, especially at the begaining stage.  It seems as if the effectivness starts to wear off with continued use.	I take 1 pill everynight before bed as needed.  Sometimes I could quit taking it when my sleep cycle was normal.
3268	zoloft	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety disorder	The drug did seem to make me feel more confident at the beginning, however towards the 10 11 months it didn't seem to work anymore.	Definitely lower my libido. Sleepiness when I first started taking it.	I just had to take the medication, there was no suggestion on counseling.
2635	depo-provera	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hormonal imbalances and pregnancy prevention	After the first two shots I had no more periods until after being off Depo Provera for nearly 3 months. Also I didn't get pregnant, which was the goal. Before getting on birth control I had been a very moody person, fighting often with people who were important to me and whom I really didn't want to fight. On the shot I still had mood swings but they were not nearly as strong.	After getting off the shot it took nearly 2 years to get pregnant with our second child; however that was to be expected as it took over a year to get pregnant with my first (Depo was my first experience with birth control). There was mild weight gain, once I started dieting and exercising I was able to deal with it though. Some mild acne but nothing anyone besides me ever noticed.	I'd visit the doctor's office once a month. At my original clinic, I would simply walk in and a nurse would inject me; after we moved to another state I learned I would have to wait 1.5-2 hours for a doctor to see and inject me, even with an appointment it could take a while. Once I had received it though I was good to go for 3 more months.
1883	doxycycline	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	deep gum pockets	So far so good. Will know more after six month mark when x-rays are taken to see if pockets are closing. One area that was highly inflamed before the deep cleaning appears to be healing well. No inflammation there and more pink as opposed to the red color it was before.	I was told yeast infections are a common side-effect with antibiotics. I noticed the beginnings of one after about four weeks so I started eating two 6 oz low-fat organic yogurts a day and I haven't had that problem again.	one year low-dose doxycycline. About five months into the treatment.
3814	solodyn	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	acne	I started this medicine to help my acne, but after a couple of weeks there was no improvement at all.  In fact, my skin was worse. I've taken other antibiotics in the past and they were much more effective at clearing up my skin.  So I stopped taking the Solodyn.	I haven't taken Solodyn now for a week and I am experiencing very itchy skin, achy joints, and fatigue.  The itchy skin is mostly on my scalp and neck. Today I had itchy hives on my leg as well.  The joint pain is mostly in my right hand and wrist. It hurts to make a fist and then open my hand back up. I've had allergic reactions to other meds before, but they would stop when I stopped the medicine.  For some reason, these nasty side effects are lingering.	none
661	suboxone	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	opioid addiction	"Suboxone is beneficial for two reasons:

1) It eliminated the opiate withdrawal when I was kicking my original drug of choice.

2) As a maintenance drug, Suboxone eliminates the cravings that I would normally have for opioids, as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids (Heroin, Oxycodone, etc.) so that there is no temptation to take these drugs.

Instead of struggling every day to avoid taking opioid drugs (and all of the terrible thing that come with being in active addiction) I can take Suboxone and move on with life. 

Suboxone may have quite literally saved my life."	"My only major complaint is that since Suboxone is an opioid (though different from Heroin, Oxy, etc.) it causes constipation. 

Due to Suboxone's opioid blocking effect, if pain medication were needed in a hospital emergency setting, there could be complications. If I came in to the ER with a broken arm and they gave me a shot of Morphine, it would do absolutely nothing. Though this hasn't been an issue for me yet."	"I am a drug addict, and although I went to rehab to get off of opiate drugs I just couldn't seem to stop. So I went on Suboxone, which is a new alternative to Methadone treatment.

While Methadone is a normal agonist opioid ('agonist' means it gets use high) it can be dispensed to drug addicts to keep them from withdrawing from their drug of choice because the Methadone lasts so long. But Methadone must be taken every day at a clinic and cannot be taken home, addicts can STILL use drugs while on Methadone if they choose too, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get off of, and Methadone still gets users high.

Suboxone is a great alternative because it can be prescribed and bought at the pharmacy so you can take it at home, it takes care of your drug cravings but it doesn't get you high (not exactly, anyways, but it does satisfy the Opiate Receptors enough) and it's really not all THAT hard to get off of if you must (the withdrawals are are VERY manageable)."
3696	effexor-xr	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	clinical depression	I could not see any benefits. I certainly did not feel any more emotionally balanced or stable than before.	This medication plunged me into experiencing menopausal symptoms. i took a blood test and my GP told me that I was not menopausal and gave me under arm deodorant which stung for the excessive sweating. My skin became extremely dry. I have no more natural vaginal secretions. My hair became very dry and I am experiencing small bald patch sin the front hair line.my sleeping pattern is absolutely awful. I look tired and haggard all the time, with enormous eye bags.The pain in my knees became a lot more severe	"I was prescribed this medication when the medication I had been taking for 2 and a half years became ineffective. I was not informed of any side effects. Every time I went to my GP to discuss symptoms which I was worried about, they just patronised me.

I no longer take any medication for my condition and although I do not consider myself to be well, some of my symptoms have reduced. The others such as incontinence, dry skin, lack of natural seretions, I am just trying to live with or trying to find products which I hope will one day help me."
149	zmax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	lingering infection - ear, sinus, throat	This treatment was easy to remember to take at only one time daily.  Although I didn't miss any dose times, if I had, the directions state to take the missed dose, unless it is almost time for the next dose time which would be the following day after the missed dose.  If the latter being so, then one should wait for the next dosage.	I've experienced no side effects with this medication as in opposition to some others which have given me problems, especially stomach discomfort/upset.  I do usually follow-up with yogurt or another form of pro-biotic after prescription antibiotics.	Take 2 tablets the first day by mouth; then, one tablet on days 2-5.  Don't take medicine within one hour before or two hours after aluminum or a magnesium-containing antacid.  Finish all of the medication, even if symptoms of the illness disappear prior to full prescription time demands in length.  Store medicine @ room temperature, away from heat and light.  Medicine may cause sensitivity to sun; avoid exposure to sun.  Notify physician if swelling, rash or hives, breathing difficulties become present.  Do not do anything that could be dangerous (Ex:  driving, operating machinery) until you know how this medicine will affect you.

2077	metformin	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	metabolic syndrome x	Reduced AM fasting glucose	When first started taking the drug, patient experienced diarrhea.  Lowered the dose and then increased it gradually instead, also splitting it into one dose in the AM and one in the PM, and the side effects disappeared.	Patient had almost all the markers for Metabolic Syndrome X / Insulin Resistance.  Physician decided that Metformin might be help the Syndome X, plus it would have the added benefit of keeping patients slightly elevated morning blood glucose levels more stable.  It is not clear that the drugs had a large effect on most of the Syndrome X symptoms, however patient has been on the drug for 8 years and it reduced the AM blood glucose levels to a normal level.
2667	prinivil	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	diabetes	Apparently, this ace inhibitor has positive effects against retinal and renal pathologies associated with diabetes and other cardio-vascular diseases.	Excessive prolonged coughing spells, especially at night, occasional diarrhea, isolated, patchy skin rashes on torso and extremities and itchy scalp all noticed within a week of starting this drug and has been persistent since.	My doctor prescribed this medication as a prophylactic measure, since I have had Type I diabetes for the last 33 years. Recent tests have shown traces of protien in my urine possibly indicating early signs of renal failure.
332	neurontin	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	neuropathy back pain	ABSOLUTLEY NONE FOR ME.	I TRUSTED MY DOCTORS AND KEPT INCREASING THE DOSE FROM THE INITIAL 300MG, 3 X DAY TO A TOTAL OF 3,000MG PER DAY. MY JOINTS BEGAN TO ACHE AND SWELL AND EVENTUALLY I COULD HARDLY WALK WITHOUT EXTREME PAIN. MY HUSBAND HAD TO ACTUALLY HELP ME IN AND OUT THE TUB. MENTALLY, I FELT WOODEN AND SPACEY. EVENTUALLY, I DECIDED TO DISCONTINUE THE DRUG AND UNLIKE DENIALS FROM MANY DOCTORS, THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM WITHDRAWAL FROM THIS DRUG WERE HORRIBLE. I EXPERIENCED EXTREME ANXIETY, INTENSE SWEATING, AND TERRIBLE NIGHTMARES. IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 3 MONTHS BEFORE I BEGAN TO FEEL HUMAN AGAIN, EXCEPT FOR THE EXCRUATING PAIN FROM THE NEUROPATY IN MY BACK.	I SUFFERED A THORACIC HERNIATION WITH SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION AND UNDERWENT A DISCECTOMY BUT UNFORTUNALY 3 MONTHS LATER SCAR TISSUE GRABBED A NERVE AND I UNDERWENT A RHIZOTOMY TO SEVER THE NERVE. I WAS LEFT WITH SEVERE DEEP NERVE ROOT NEUROPATHY OF THE SPINAL CORD. THE TREAMENT WAS NARCOTICS AND AN ANTI-SEIZURE. THE NEUROTIN WAS BEGAN IMMEDIATELY BUT AS DESCRIBED ABOVE WAS NOT EFFECTIVE AT ALL FOR PAIN RELIEF. IN FACT, IT EXACERBATED MY PAIN. I AM NOT BEING EVALUATED FOR A SPINE STIMULATOR.
856	valium	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	feeling more relaxed and able to go to work, the breath slowed, shaking stopped and mood improved	no side effects and no problem when stopped	just as the anxiety arised I took 10 or 20 drops depending on the strength of the symptoms and after a while I was normal again
1042	vyvanse	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	add	I needed to switch from straterra which made me very very depressed quiet and i slept for like an hour each night with that drug it was horrible. I switched to Vyvanse and the first time i took it, it was like an anti deppresant at first i was the normal happy hyper me but i could still focus very well on studying but when i started comming down from it that was the worst i was dry heaving with a TERRIBLE HEADACHE for an hour and then i would just throw everything up it made me very irritated i would twitch ALOT and my heart beat was fast and very heavy but after my second day my body started getting use to it and i havent had anymore problems with it.	"throwing up alot, bad headaches, twitching, crazy heart beat, loss of appetite (which is a plus in my eyes), and happy thoughts (like ""wow im soo beautiful"" for some reason would pop in my head alot), as well as some negative thoughts and worrying about homework constantly which is fine to because i would get it all done."	So far the throwing up has stopped and the headaches come and go no food even looks good to eat no cravings very easy to diet ;) and passing all my finals was AMAZING. This drug makes strattera look like tylenol!
505	paxil-cr	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	obsessive compulsive disorder	It allowed me to feel good enough to ignore and not be bothered by persistent thoughts and anxiety that I could not ignore before. Basically it leveled me out, where the anxiety didn't affect me anymore.	Getting on the drug was tough, because I endured insomnia, sweating, loss of appetite, high-anxiety, shaking, hands, and restlessness.  After about 2-3 weeks, however, all those symptoms went away, once my body got used to it.  I did have some weight gain, but I was really skinny to begin with.	I've dealt with anxiety since I was a kid as well as obsessive thinking.  It continued to build until I was 17 and I had a major panic attack, which I could not calm down from.  My psychiatrist put me on Paxil CR and I worked up to 25 mg.  The dosage made a big difference, though I still had moderate levels of anxiety, but I could function.  About a year and a half ago I was hit with another major attack that send me into a relapse for about 2-3 months, then I upped my dosage to 37.5 mg and within a week I felt fine, even better than I felt before.  Now a year and a half later, I found myself in another relapse and after a week I released that all this time I was not at a high enough dosage because my anxiety and obsessive thoughts would still creep in and cause me distress.  So my psychiatrist agreed that I was not at my ideal dosage and I am now taking two 25 mg in the morning which equals 50 mg, which is still a fairly moderate dosage considering other patients that were on 80 to even 120 mg.  I just started taking it, so I should start feeling even better within about a week or two.  I've accepted that I may need to be on this for the long haul, which is fine.  I look at is as nutrition for the brain, or like taking insulin for diabetes, it allows me function and enjoy life.
320	ativan	2	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	sleep problem	At first, could actually sleep. The sleep issue has been life long and various natural things helped but not always.  As stress increased, nothing helped,not even the Ativan.	"Loss of energy.  Huge increase in anger and irritability over seemingly non-issues.  Personality changes to being more depressed and pessimistic.  World view was negative, and everyone was an 'asshole'.  Did not want to do anything or try anything or go out.  Not even things normally that were turn ons ie. movies, dancing, sex, food
After 6-8months on the drug, it helped not at all and sleep was down to 1-2 hours per nite."	"Very simple, just take drug at night before bed.  Doctor prescribed for no more thatn 3 nights per week, but as sleep deprivation increased, so did the taking of the Ativan.  Sublingual helped better than pill.  Took drug up to 5 nights per week.  
Ran out of Ativan at some point and realized after a 3-4 days that was sleeping better and felt better mentally, emotionally and physically.  Realized that the drug had severely affected his personality and motivation.  sex drive and pleasure increased with each week off the Ativan.  Swore to never use it again because the difference in how he felt was like night and day, once he got off the pills."
3697	effexor-xr	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	My symptoms of depression were eased considerably.  I felt more like myself and began to take pleasure in activities. I stopped feeling sad and crying. I was able to concentrate again.  My appetite returned and my sleep patterns normalized.	The drug made me nauseated the first month I took it. The only other significant ongoing side effect I experienced was constipation.	I began taking Effexor XR when I was severely depressed. I took it once a day for approximately five years.  My symptoms included crying, lack of interest in life, inability to concentrate, loss of appetite, and sleeping more than usuual. I could barely get out of bed and I could not function. Within two weeks of beginning treatment with Effoxor, I began to feel take more of an interest in normal activities and was able to eat and sleep normally.
2051	prempro	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hot flashes	I had severe hot flashes all day and night. The night episodes kept me awake most of the night with alternating hot, sweaty flashes, followed by teeth-rattling chills.  Prempro eliminated the vast majority of episodes so i could sleep	There were no side effects that I was aware of	I took 1 pink pill each day, in the morning after breakfast.
1008	darvocet-n	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pain after surgery	The Darvocet helped with the pain very well in the beginning after returning home from the hospital, but within a week and a half I began to feel as if it weren't helping as much and I needed more. After my two weeks were up on taking it, I gradually just didn't need it any more.	During treatment I would get very weepy and depressed any time I was awake.  Of course I slept for hours after I would take it.  Other than those two things there were no side effects.	I had surgery for endometriosis that left me in the hospital for over a week.  The doctor had to cut my stomach totally across the bottom to rid my body of the diseased tissue.  I'd been on morphine in the hospital, then came home taking the Darvocet for the next two weeks.
3708	ranitidine	5	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	rash	Decreased redness and bumpiness by day 6. I believe the benefits were associated with the prescribed medication. However, I was also using a histamine blocking topical cream during the course of treatment.	None noted	Rash of unknown origin. Intense itching, redness, and bumpy texture beginning on neck and slowly migrating around to appendages. Took prescription described above, as recommended. On Day 6, I noticed decreased irritation associated with rash.
1319	prevacid	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	pre-barrett (errosion of the esophagus)	the prevacid allows me to eat and drink certain foods/fluids that I normally could not tolerate anymore without great discomfort i.e. spicy foods, coffee, chocolate, tomato products, and alcholic drinks, which I only drink occassionally such as red wine.  If I skip the prevacid for any reason, I almost certainly will be very uncomfortable.	It seems to give me a tendency to gain weight in the abdomen.  I did try some alternatives, including Nexium, which was not a good substitute at all!	I have been on prevacid for approximately 6 years as a a prophylactic against the pre-barretts.  I have tried to slowly come off the drug (it is the only one I use) but I would venture to guess that unless I changed my diet significantly, this is not going to happen.
4047	amoxil	10	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	infection from grazing an ankle on coral	"I very mildly scratched my left ankle (right on the protruding bone) while snorkeling in the ocean. 
The abrasion was so small that I didn't do any first aid other than wash the area off when showering.
Over the next 3 days the are became inflamed and I began to apply antibiotic powder to try to dry the inflamed area.
On the 4th morning the tiny scratch had developed to the point were the abrasion was an oozing sore about the size of a quarter and my foot was red and swollen making it impossible to put on a shoe.
I immediately went to a local doctor who prescribed amoxilin tablets.
The drug was very effective and the effects could be felt within 24 hours."	The drug upset my stomach mildly. Otherwise no side effects noticed.	"I was given a 3 day prescription which is the reason I am submitting this report. 
I believe antibiotics should be prescribed in a course of 7 - 10 days. 
This practice as far as I know was very popular in Hong Kong and it still might be general practice.
In my case I did not want to return to the doctors office and be charged again for another consultation + purchase additional amoxilin as I was not covered by medical insurance at that time.
Instead I went to a local pharmacy with the package of antibiotics I received from the doctors office and asked if I could buy 12 tablets. They were more than happy to sell them to me (at a fraction of the cost I paid at the doctors office) and I followed through with a 7 day course.
The results were very positive and within 24 hours I could feel relief and I knew that the infection was being affected by the amoxilin. By the 3rd day the swelling was greatly reduced and other than a nasty wound on my ankle bone I felt very good. I continued the remaining 4 days and besides a scar on my ankle at the site of the infection I completely recovered."
1157	septra	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	mrsa skin infection	My daughter suffered from an outbreak of painful skin boils on her lower back and stomach, probably 6 total over a few weeks.  They would heal individually after draining (also painful) but more would continually form.  The doctor diagnosed them as caused by MRSA and prescribed Septra along with daily washes with hibiclens soap.  It took 5 days for one very large, undrained boil to heal, but it did heal without draining.  More importantly, the boils stopped forming.	Made her sensitive to the sun, easily sunburned	She was given an oral suspension (8 mg/mL trimethoprim and 40 mg/mL sulfamethoxazole) of which she needed to take 7 mLs 2 times a day for 10 days.  She took it once in the morning after breakfast, and once before bed.
3456	tamiflu	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	swine flu	'Was diagnosed with H1N1 and was ill for at little past 3 weeks.  My doctor gave me a prescription for Tamiflu (2 x day for 5 days) on the 3rd day after becoming rapidly ill (onset of high fever -- temp went from 102.8 to 103.2 pretty fast).  Within a few minutes (15 - 20?) after taking it, I noticed I would feel better, and I'd start coughing up mucus from the lungs.  The feeling wore off after a few hours.  I was able to complete the full 5-day course.	I think I remember not being able to taste very well.  But that could've been a side effect of the flu. And after taking Tamiflu the first time, I kinda remember being able to breathe more deeply than normal.  That effect wore off after a few hours.  Seemed to get used to the medication & didn't experience anything else.	Prescribed Tamiflu for 5 days (one capsule twice daily).  Couldn't do anything buy just lay there.  Tried to make myself drink liquids and eat something (when I could start eating).
603	risperdal	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	psychosis	I did not experience any benefits whatsoever.	I suffered increased anxiety, more dilusions, several migraine headaches, insomnia and tremors.  I became even more unable to function than I was prior to taking the drug.

I tried to taper off of it and fould it very difficult the lowest doesage i can take is 100mg.  a little drowsy in the morning but after a couple of cups of coffee im fine.	sleepiness	My advise: have a sleep study done to make sure its a psych. issue instead of a medical issue because i also suffer from sleep apnea and  now use a CPAP
40	zyprexa	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	schizophrenia	There was very little benefit to me. I was having psychotic episodes every day. The drug puportedly taken to stop the episodes did nothing. The best thing it did was make me drowsy and help me sleep.	The side effect mainly was weight gain, especially around the abdominal area. I've been on a medically supervised diet to lose the weight I gained from the drug and have lost weight but not around my abdomen, it seems the Olanzapine can cause this type of weight gain.	I see a psychiatrist monthly. I have tried every drug recommended for Schizophrenia and none of the drugs have worked. I still have psychotic episodes.
1841	yasmin	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	contraception	pregnancy prevention	dry eyes, anal fissure - both were diagnozed by my phisicians. Initially I didn't attribute these side effects to Yasmin, but both improved dramatically once I stopped taking the medication.

2301	lexapro	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/anxiety	Significantly decreased depression and suicidality, improved sleep, more stable moods and increased energy.	Initially Lexapro lowered sex drive but this seems to have returned to normal. Occasional dry mouth. On 10mg Lexapro failed to relieve depression and associated symptoms.

At 15mg patient is able to feel emotions and manage minimal depressive symptoms while undergoing accompanying psychotherapy treatment.
113	celebrex	1	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	arthritis	The benefits were highly good in the fact that it immensley eased the pain in the joints of my mother.When she stopped taking the medication she was faced with accute pain again, so she kept on taking it.	The side effects at first were that if she didnt take it the pain would come back.   She was eventually diagonsed with large cell carcinoma of the lungs.  She had an exam before taking celebrix and was clear but after 2 years of taking it she had cancer. whilst in hospital she learnt that fellow patients also taking the same medication also developed large cell arcinoma of the lungs. Is it a coincidene i may ask?.I also remember she was short of breath.	"Treatment details is as followed she took twice daily with food.
sometimes she forgot to take her medication soon to realise that the pain was coming back.  So hence she realised she had forgotten to take it.   It clearly worked to relieve the pain of arthritis."

In some cases, it lessened it too much."	There were strange sensations when 2+ doses were missed. Certain sounds seemed exaggerated.	This was part of a treatment for Adult ADD.

1468	cymbalta	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	sever depression	This medication saved my life. The depression had gotten so sever that I was unable to function properly. It has made me feel like a 'real' person again. It has not done much for the anxiety, panic, or OCD. The Xanax helps with that area. I will be going to the psychiatrist in 2 weeks for the anxiety, panic, and OCD. Hoping to stay on the Cymbalta. I was on Lexapro 30mg from 2000-2006. Then switched to Celexa (cost reasons) 60mg from 2007-2008. The Celexa just about costed me my life. It was ineffective for the Depression. Try not to take Celexa for cost reasons, Lexapro shows much more promise in its effectiveness.	"Weight gain, which is to be expected when you ""feel better"""	Depression and Anxiety

3847	voltaren	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	osteo arthritis	Without the Voltarin, every step I take makes my joints feel like cracking glass and they ache constantly.

I only stopped taking it as the condition itself lessened.	None	I would apply it to my skin, after washing, either at night (best time), or in the morning.  I would also use a good spf to protect my skin from sun in the day
122	valtrex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	genital herpes	"After having this virus for many years I resolved that I was going to look for a possible suppressant. As the medical community acknowledges once you have contacted the virus it will be awaiting an opportunity to break through - especially in times of stress or tiredness. Prior to taking Valtrex I was having a viral herpes attack for about 10 days at a time at least four times a year, sometimes 8 times a year.

Valtrex is an amazing drug!

My experience has been that  if you take a tablet each day you will not transmit the virus to your 
partner provided that you pay attention to the first signs of the virus and abstain from intimate sexual encounters for five days or so or until you can feel or see no more signs of the virus.

To be honest it frustrates me that so many people suffer from this virus but are not informed as to how to treat the problem.

Hope this helps and gives encouragement. For me it has been on par with a miracle.
 
Since taking the drug once daily I have had one only one potential outbreak in the past two and a half  years- at the onset of the potential outbreak I increased the dose to 3  tablets a day twice a day day for four days. This treatment suppressed the outbreak and the symptoms which I felt appeared very slightly and then disappeared within 48 hours."	To be honest I have had no side effects that I can determine.	"1 tablet a day in the morning.
If symptoms beginning 3 tablets three times a day for 5 days or until symptoms have disappeared."

2028	protonix	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	It has totally neutralized the effects of my reflux.	No side effects encountered.	I started getting reflux after I had gall bladder surgery when I was 24. I had tried just about every reflux drug out there, but they either didn't work or had unacceptable side effects. When I first tried Protonix I couldn't believe how normal I felt within a couple days. It works so well for me, I forget I have reflux sometimes. I haven't noticed any issues with foods or coffee since taking it.
3609	retin-a	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	After I built up a tolerance, I had little peeling when I applied it only once a day. Used in combination with Erthyrom. caplets (and also topical, used occasionally), I have been able to control deep acne cysts. While the Erthyrom. is probably the major factor, the Retin-A is a good addition.	Peeling which can chafe the skin and interfer with putting on face makeup. However, I have built up such a tolerance, I would have to apply Retin-A 2-3 times daily to achieve major peeling. It is hard to measure the anti-aging effect, as I don't know what I would look like without having used Retin-A.	I use once at night. Because I have built up a tolerance, I have no adverse side effects. If I do have occasional peeling, I remove/stimulate it with a Buff Puff.
396	relpax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraine headaches	Relpax would take the migraine headache away, including secondary symptoms such as neck aches, jaw pain, and nausea.	"Side effects were minimal.  I'd feel tired/lethargic following the initiation of it's effects, but the fatigue might be related to the Migraine headache rather than the drug (??).  I would sometimes get a ""rebound"" migraine headache of decreased intensity approximately 2 days after the treatment."	"Relpax was prescribed on an ""as needed"" basis for my migraines.  It was taken after the onset of migraine, usually when I realized that it would not go away via conventional over the counter headache medicines.  It starts to take effect at approximately 1-2 hours after I take the pill.  This medicine has been a ""life saver"" for me.  It allows me to function and go on with important things in my life even when I get a migraine."

1106	effexor	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	In comparison with other antidepression medications I have taken prior to the effexor, It actually began working faster than the others (after about 2 weeks).  Most antidepressants usually take closer to 4 weeks to see improvements. Depression symptoms were significantly reduced.	I experienced moderate constipation as well as excessive night sweating.  Would become completely drenched in sweat during sleep. Also experienced sexual side effects (low libido). The thing I really don't like about effexor is that if I miss a day for some reason, I begin to experience feelings of dizziness within 24 hours.	150 mg daily

This is a good thing because I do not like pills.  This medication helped tremedously.	a little nausea. This medication has a high risk of addiction. When you take it be very careful that you do not misuse. The lortab reduces the pain on the first pill however as you take the medication it seems to take more pills as you go along to recieve the same releif as first.	take one to two tablets by mouth every 8 hours as needed for pain.
1665	climara	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hot flash sleep problems	My moods have improved dramatically.  I would wake at least 3 times a night and have difficulty going back to sleep (sleep was always a problem), but now sleep is much better.  Hot flashes were intense and distracting, and have since stopped.  I originally took Premarin which gave me headaches.  The patch and it's consistent delivery has helped immensely to reduce number and severity of headaches.	The only drawback to using the patch is a mild allergy to the adhesive.  Sometimes the patch slips and has come off several times in the bath, so I've had to pull out a new one.  I do not like having to take progesterone separately in pill form, or at all, but with a uterus it is necessary.  I'm also concerned about long-term effects.	"I originally began using HRT 5 years ago to help with very severe menopausal symptoms.  I had tried all the natural remedies as I was very concerned about taking a medication:  herbs, soy, etc.  I walked 30 miles a week and did yoga, none of which helped.  In desperation I visited my OB GYN who suggested I go on HRT, stating that quality of life needed to be considered.  Shortly, thereafter, the reports initial study was released, and again I spoke to my doctor who said that she thought the results were over inflated.  I switched to estradiol because it's considered more effective, and the patch bypasses the liver with delivery directly through the skin.  I've since weaned myself off several times, only to have the symptoms return.  I'm concerned about latest studies and have thought about weaning myself off again, and then think, ""quality of life""."
518	requip	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	restless leg syndrome	While standing, my legs were fine, but aching, cramping legs were keeping me from getting any sleep.  My doctor suggested I try Requip, and its been the best thing I have done.	I have experienced no side effects, except sleeping at night.  The warning says that it might make you drowsy, but that's also why they say to take it at night.	I take Requip about 1-1/2 to 2 hours before bedtime.  It permits relaxation of legs so I can sleep.
706	accutane	4	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acne	I had the Accutane treatment in 1997 and the short term results (6 months - 1 years) were fantastic, with the exception that the treatment left a big scar on my face and there is nothing I can do about it. After a year I began to have acne breakouts again. Now, six years later, I am also having breakouts in my back and in new places like my neck, chest, behind my ears and (believe it or not!) some in my belly. When I when back for another opinion, they wanted me to have a second Accutane treatment -- no way! Also, after the treatment I can't live without chapstick... My lips are always very dry.

4007	celexa	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression, irritability	The benefits of Celexa have been surprising and welcome.  Over the passt 15 years I've been given every anti-depressant the doctors could think of.  Most had no effect at all, some had such uncomfortable side effects that I couldn't take them long enough to find out if they would help at all.  One (I can't remember the name) actually lifted my depression almost immediately and made me feel great, but after about 3 weeks I was suddenly plunged into a depression that was darker and more frightening than any I'd experienced before.  I stopped taking it.	The side effects I experienced with Celexa were heart palpitations during the first few weeks of taking it, which later subsided.  Yawning was also a side effect, but it went away after a couple of months.	I take 1 1/2 40 mg. tablets of Celexa once a day.
406	restasis	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	dry eyes	Restasis dramatically improved issues related to dry eyes, the primary problems were discomfort (the feeling that something was in my eye) and obvious redness.  Both issues disappeared when I started taking restsis.  There was a short period where I ran out of restasis and stopped, after about a week the dry eye symptoms had reappeared, only to do away when I resumed treatment.	there were not any side effects.	1-2 eye drops twice a day

3064	oxycodone	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	post surgery	benefits were the pain relieving benefits	Side effects were a little troubling to me.  Although the pain was not diminished completely, I noticed that when I had severe pain, the meds did absolutely no good.  Perhaps if I'd taken more than the recommended dosage, it would have been effective, but I did not want to do that.  It also had a negative effect on my brain.  I could not think clearly, I felt like I was in a fog.  I also spent alot of time sleeping which was another side effect I did not like.	Took this med following surgery for pain control.
2494	remeron	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	depression	No apparent benefits.  Had virtually no effect on my depression and it quickly became intolerable to use.	Extreme drowsiness, weight gain.

After using for some time, however, breakouts ceased and skin became nearly acne-free,	Dry skin, minor irritation	Applied Differin to skin in the evening, most evenings for several years. Acne was improved after a period of 3-4 months. Treatment contiued for a period of several years.

I spent 6 foggy days feeling like I had the worst case of the flu ever. All I did was sleep and urinate for 6 days -the other end was so constipated I didn't go for four days. My stomach hurt less before my gall bladder surgery than with this drug.  I will NEVER take macrobid again and I don't know how a responsible pharmaceutical company can manufacture a drug they know can produce worse problems then it cures.	two pills per day with a lot of water.
2618	buprenorphine	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	major depression	"Subutex is mostly used to help opiate addicts withdrawal more comfortably from opiod drugs such as Vicodin, Oxycodone, and even Heroin. However, I was started on Subutex because my doctor and I were having no luck finding another med that would augment my current depression medications of Effexor XR and Adderall (which were only partially working). My doctor had found research suggesting that Subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking ""opiate""), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. My doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! I have had almost ALL good results from this medication. It has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. The following are the benefits that I have noticed from taking Subutex:
     1. Quick-acting - because Subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.
     2. Gentle effects - I have definitly not experienced any ""highs"". Just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.
     3. Also helps somewhat with anxiety by having a calming effect; in normal doses this happens without any tiredness.
     4. Have not noticed ANY of the side effects that I have found with other psychiatric medications such as weight gain/loss, personality changes, sexual effects, etc. Also, in case anyone is worried that Subutex is a ""partial-opiate agonist"", I must emphasize that this med DOES NOT build a tolerance or make you want/need to increase dosage. I have been on this dose for four years without ever even thinking about needing more. HOWEVER!!! You must understand that - as is the case with ALL psychiatric medications - you cannot simply stop taking this medication without tapering your dose first or you will experience withdrawal effects. The one saving grace about Subutex, though, is that it has a very long half-life and will remain in your system long enough to prevent any type of withdrawal even if you miss a day or two of medication."	None.	I take two 8mg tablets in the afternoon by putting them under my tongue and allowing them simply to dissolve. I do this again at night as I get into bed. That's pretty much it!
1983	fiorinal	5	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	tension headaches	It assisted the ibuprofen and cortizone in pain relief.	I had no side effects.	I have severe tension headaches on a every other day basis.  Occasional swelling in the top of neck. if ibuprofen didnt do the job, fiorinal usually topped it off.  but this medicine alone didnt do much for me. I was prescribed 1 to 2 pills every 6 hours when headaches occurs.
1905	doxycycline	4	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	I originally began this treatment for acne and I'm still in the process of my acne treatments. However, after a little over two weeks of treatment and seeing an improvement in my skin, I went in for a pap smear and found out that I have asymptomatic chlamydia. I was prescribed 1 gram of Azithromycin and while doing my research found out that the exact same dosage I've been taking of doxycycline for 1-2 weeks is considered an effective way of treating chlamydia, but clearly that did not work for me.	There was one morning I only had an 80 calorie granola bar for breakfast and I took my dose and I ended up having terrible nausea. Will never make that mistake again.	So far my acne has improved. I'm hoping it goes away, my main message is to point out it did not treat my chlamydia.
2350	propecia	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hair loss	My hair loss was stopped and I eventually grew new hair at the hairline and where the hair had receded on the side. I do not know if it affected my crown.	I noticed a slightly lowered libido and possibly a more slowly growing beard. My libido seems to be back to normal.	I have to take 1mg/day to stop hair loss. I did not notice results until recently after having taken it for 6 months and I am hoping to notice even more once I have been on it for a year.
531	trazodone	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/difficulty sleeping	I took it before bed, and it helped me get to sleep. It also helped me cope during a difficult time emotionally.	The drug is an anti-depressant. The side effect was sleepiness, which is also therapeutic when taken at night.	Ongoing treatment for several years with 50 mg at bedtime.
161	zomig	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	persistant migraines	Elminated 95% of Migraines/Headaches!	"Within about 15-30 min, I start feeling mild tingling in my throat, back of my neck & chest. Its a little scary the first time, but it only lasts for about 10-15 min and then my migraine disappears with the side effects! No drowsiness or feeling groggy like others have complained of in my experience. I have found that it is more effective and works more quickly if I'm able to lay down in quiet when I ""feel"" it starting to work."	My insurance covers it like a normal RX, but it only comes with 10 pills for the duration, but still worth every penny. I have tried ALL KINDS of other migraine meds, with absolutely no success. Zomig was my last hope without seeing a specialist (again) and trying combos of meds. Over the past several months, it has cured almost all of my migraines (it doesn't help sinus headaches, but does help alcohol induced headaches-I get them even after one glass of wine). The mild side effects are completely tolerable considering I'm only sacrificing 1 hour, at most now, as opposed to 1-2 days. I can be a real person again!!!
1663	climara	4	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	menopause, memory loss, night sweats, low libido	nothing noticeable really, night sweats improved (slightly), memory, not as fuzzy	"Weight gain 4 lbs, my weight has  always been stable, bloatiness/gas (uncomfortable)
hair loss (more than usual and thinner), depression (crying for no reason)"	Change patch every 7 days. Very difficult keeping the patch on. I'm going to ask the Dr. for different type of patch. Heard Vivelle is smaller and stays on bettetr.
3114	ortho-tri-cyclen	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	pregnancy prevention	Benefits were the prevention of pregnancy, regular periods, shorter periods, and less intense pms symptoms.  My breasts went from a full C cup to a full D cup!  I'm on lexapro so that might be the reason i didn't experience really bad mood swings or any depression like some people said they have.  Nothing really changed other than that and it's great to know when i will get my period.	For the first month of taking ortho tri cyclen i was a little moody.  When my period started the first month i was very moody but that only lasted about 3 days.  The second month of my period my pms calmed down and now i have no mood swings and only one day of cramps.	I take the sunday start pills everyday in the afternoon.
2422	synthroid	8	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	The drug Levothyroxine 100 mics daily that I took for hypothyroidism was advantagious for my metobolic effect. I did have more energy and felt more alert and awake, as before where I felt lithargic and brain dead.If I inadvertantly skipped a day of medication, I felt like I would notice my sluggishness a few days later.	I had no side effects.	I have since stopped taking the Levothyroxine 100 mics daily. My provider explained to me since I was still feeling tired was to switch to the brand name Synthroid 100 mics daily. I have noticed a big difference in my energy level and alertness. I can't believe I have gone this long (15 years) feeling tired and out of sorts. I wish now I had been taking the brand name all along. No telling what things I may acomplished.
2733	elavil	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression/insomnia	"This medication was prescribed for its side effect of drowsiness.  Although it is mainly used as an anti-depressant, in the tricyclic family, it causes considerable drowsiness at even a low dose of 50mg.  This immediately helped with my insomnia.  It also caused no daytime ""hangover"" effect and the dose can be increased easily."	The major side effect of drowsiness is desirable in my case, but it also has a marked side effect of weight gain.  In addition, there is a dry mouth effect that seems to resolve after a month or two.	This was prescribed by my psychiatrist after trying several newer hypnotics.  The newer medications such as Ambien and Lunestra caused sleep disturbances, particularly altered dreams states.  In the case of the latter, it is prohibitively expensive.
1604	xalatan	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	glaucoma	lowering of intraocular  pressure /keeping it under control	A slight change in the coulour of the treated eye.	"My juvenile/pigmentary (open angle) glaucoma was diagnosed when I was 26 in 1989 (my mother also had it). I was prescribed 2 kinds of eye drops which were effective for some time, but after a while, they couldn't control the intraocular pressure in my left eye, so I had to undergo a trabeculectomy in 1992.
Now I put drops only in my right eye (Cosopt 2 times a day and Xalatan once a day before I go to sleep). My eye pressure has been under control ever since."
2522	motrin	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	prostatitis (chronically)	"The symptoms and mal feelings of my prostate disapeared - but not completely (perhaps 70% of the Problems disapeared).
Sexual Funktion and feelings of prostate improved remarkable.

(Only 70% of improvement perhaps my personal problems were not solved with Ibuprofen - and such problem put a lot of stress on prostata in some men)"	"There were hardly any noticeable side effects.
The only thing I had to care about, was to take the medicine (Ibuprofen) with food/ a meal because otherwise it would cause gastric problems.
And I took the second daily pill with dinner and left some ours before go to sleep.
Perhaps Ibuprofen causes a light drop in bloodsugar - but I�m not definitely sure about that."	"I had a bakterial prostatitis in the winter (likely from a combination of psychological and personal stress, bike riding in very cold conditions).

1786	citalopram	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Some symptoms of depression - crying all the time, dark thoughts - were lessened, although hard to know how much benefit the treatment gave all told or whether I would have come through it anyway as I had in the past.	"When started on treatment: vivid images when eyes closed, trembling, anxiety, feeling of detachedness
Throughout treatment: Insomnia and disrupted sleep patterns, some dizziness at times, muscular twitching, fidgeting and spasming, weight loss due mostly to fidgeting all the time
Coming off treatment: what others have termed ""brain shivers"", a sort of brain zing which was very disturbing, crying, feeling like the depression was coming back"	20mg once daily for 5 months, weaning self off over 1 month decreasing dosage until 10mg every two days then stopped
1191	prozac	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	The drug seemed to effectively treat the symptoms of depression for a year or so.  After the first year or so the depression seemed to come back now and then - although it did seem to be cyclical.	Nausea if taken on an empty stomach, shakiness, dry mouth.	There were no other details of the treatment.  I changed to another drug that worked more effectively and have been on that one for several years.

2256	lexapro	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	I have clinical depression with aggitation and anger. This medication seemed to take the edge off the anger as well as decrease my depressive symptoms. I started at 10mg, then shortly increased to 20mg, which left me feeling too drugged. It was only after 12+ months of taking 10 mg that it was increased due to increasing depressive symptoms.	Initially the medication made me very drowsy. I began taking it at bedtime, which seemed to eleviate that particular concern.  I think there may have been some weight gain, but I am not certain that it was specifically related to the Lexapro. Also, I did initially have difficult acheiving orgasm, but this side effect seemed to diminish within 6-9 months.	I'm not sure waht you mean here- I started on the medication over 2 years ago at 10 mg a day. The dosage was increased to 20 mg after about 12 months.  The side effects were limited, and mostly not perticularly bothersome.

2588	oxazepam	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety due to relationship stress	I would get heart palpitations and major stress hours before my ex would come and pick up our daughter for visits; I also had difficulty sleeping if I had to deal with any issues with him; I would take one of these pills, only if I felt I needed and sometimes an hour before he would pick her up, and I would feel much calmer.  It was a life saver for  me until I got through the emotional upset and was able to detach.	Virtually no side effects, other than very slight drowsiness several hours after taking it...almost not noticeable.	I was on a very small dose.  And I only took this when I felt I needed it.  It was a life saver and kept my body from experiencing intense stress like shaking, heart palpitations, and emotional upset.  It did not change my mood.  It only controlled the negative physical effect that I was allowing this person to have on me.
2687	prinivil	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	hypertension	My mother had slight high blood pressure and was prescribed Lisinopril along with the water pill. The medication was doing its job, lowering BP to normal.	Patient started with a sporadic cough. Any fragrance at all no matter how light the fragrance was would trigger a cough attack. Patient thought it was allergies. It then worsened and she was coughing day and night. She couldn't even sleep. It became so severe she was coughing all the time, when she talked when she ate. It was exhausting and debilitating, the cough was killing her. She then thought it was some lung problem, although she is not a smoker.  She went to the Dr and Dr did a few allergy test and lung x rays.  Well, then finally Dr checked high blood pressure medication.  Yes, of course!!! it was the medication.  She stopped taking it and the cough was completely gone, just like magic.	Patient was taking a low dose of Lisinopril 1 pill a day for slight high blood pressure. She took the medication on and off for 5 years.  She would take it when she felt she needed it.  Sometimes for about 3 months in a row and other times just 1 time a week.

810	ambien	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	Made me sleepy enough to shut down and go to bed, although it typically still took  me hours to get to sleep. The sleep that I got from this medication was deep and refreshing.	Extreme drowsiness the next morning/afternoon, dependence, slight headache.	I have had insomnia for as long as I can remember, as it is a symptom of my illness. I usually go to bed around 7 AM if at all, and I don't mind it usually, except when I have responsibilities the next day and I am unable to fulfill obligations due to exhaustion. The first few times I tried Ambien, my doctor prescribed me Ambien CR which is extended-release.. I was taking the 12.5 milligrams. This medication gave me extremely bad headaches and didn't really affect my sleeping pattern. I went back and asked her to prescribe me another dosage, and she gave me the lower 10 mg dosage, not extended release. This dosage makes me feel very groggy at night, and a little drugged out. I have noticed dependency issues developing with it, even in my short time taking it.
2232	allegra	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinusitis	"I have a recurring sinus problem wherein my nasal passages get blocked and throat and vocals are affected.
This is aggravated by my smoking as well."	The drug was considerably free of side effects. Though i don't know whether this was due to the drug, but i did get sleepy more often than usual.	"As mentioned,I have a recurring sinus problem wherein my nasal passages get blocked and throat and vocals are affected.

1927	zithromax	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	pneumonia	It cleared up my coughing within 2 days.  I could sleep far better at night.	I had mild diarrhea, though I'm not sure if it was due to the drug.	I was told by my doctor to take the medication once a day for about 5 days.  The best results came within 2 days, and seemed to plateau after that.  I requested another prescription so I ended up taking it for about 2 weeks, but I seemed to see little improvement during the 2nd prescription.  It was probably because the bacteria was kept under control, but my body was taking time to heal.
1143	grifulvin-v	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	fungus	The benefits of the treatment were clearing a fungal infection that plaqued me for a few months.	I did not experince any treatment side effects. However, I did get pregnant while taking the medicine, but I did not have any complications.	I had to take 3 pills everyday for six weeks to clear up the fungal infection. The treatment was not hard, but it was effective.
3832	lumigan	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	longer eyelashes	The Lumigan made my lashes grown longer and thicker. I didn't need to use as much mascara.	I got itchy eyelids. The itching was fairly mild.	I put a drop of lumigan on an upside down teacup. Then I applied lumigan with a very fine artists type paintbrush. I would paint a thin line just above the lashes on top and just below the lashes on bottom. I would then use the remainder on my eyebrows. After about 6 weeks I noticed my lashes were longer and thicker. I washed the paintbrush carefully after each use and was careful to keep the line thin. After the first week, I began to use it every other night.
425	imitrex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraine	Once a day, sometimes 2 in a 24 hour period depending on the severe headache	none	I have had migraines since I was 9 years old. Through JR high I would finish a bottle of aspirin in a week and a half. About every 3 or 4 days they were horrible with nausea , cold pack on my head, stay out of the light. About 9 years ago I developed cluster migraines. They last all day, nite for 4-5 months. I was introduced to imitex in 2005. THANK GOD!!!  They have been increasing in cost terribly. I went through sinus aerials, allergy tests, bio feed back. etc. Nothing helped. I thought I would take my life when these clusters started. Not only could I not function but I had to sleep sitting up. Lying dowm made them worse.  I have no side effects.  But the imitrex is not working as well and I take aleve with it. Treximet is not strong enough.
2001	vicodin	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	i got my toothpulled	I took the drug shortly after having my tooth pulled.  I never noticed a great amount of pain, and contribute this to the laughing gas and novicane during the proceduce, and taking the vicadin shortly after the procedure. I took the vicadin drug twice because after several hours I started to feel pain again.  It was effective in reliefing my pain.	After taking the drug, I became sick to my stomach.  I threw up everything that I had consumed prior to the procedure.  This feeling stayed with me for several hours.  I initally thought I was sick, because I did not eat when I took the first dosage.  I then took another dose, but this time I made myself eat a little something, (I could not eat much at this point), but it mattered not...I got sick again.  I threw the rest of the presciption out.	The prescription was given to me prior to having my tooth pulled.  I never filled the prescription because I really did not notice any pain.  After the procedure, I immediately went to have the prescription filled.  I took the medication while I was still numb from the novicane.  As the novicane wore off, and the two tablets I took wore off, I took the vicadine once again.
3407	proscar	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	hair loss	I noticed hair regrowth in small amounts but did not know my genitals were shrinking.  A friend told me of his testicles shrinking on the drug and so I examined myself and realized that what once was, was no more.	Testiclular Atrophy (permenent shrinkage). I actually have one testicle now smaller than the other.  I pray everyday that the pain will go away and that my buddies will come back but I dont think they will.  As for penile shrinkage, imagine a button on a sweater.  This drug is poison and Im looking for a class action suit.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!!!!	1mg a day
4030	tri-luma	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne, melasma	lightning of dark pigments	some dry skin especially under eye area	Applied once at night as directed.  Applied sunscreen in morning of SPF 30.  Some dark pigmentation was lightened significantly but some places didn't lighten enough to go unnoticed.  Acne was not helped, suprisingly, but the treatment did not make it worse either. Overall skin appearance looked more uniform.
3098	triphasil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	contraception	General Medical:  The treatment is for contraception.  I used it for weight control, skin problems and as a contraception, it was very effective for all of it except that when i left the medication I experienced severe hair loss which i was not warned about	severe hair loss after terminating the pill, but no others whilst on it	Daily dose usually taken at night
3006	cipro	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	possible uti	none...I am reguired to write fifty words bon the treatment benefits but since I had to discontinue the drug or die there were no benefits and I would be telling a bald faced lie if I said there were and but I will keep on typing so that I comply with the request for the fifty word minimun	"severe heart palpitations
severe panic attack involving racing morbid thoughts with fear of dying
that stuff is poison...google side effects
I also suffered head aches and leg and foot cramps and this was from only three 500 mg doses which is very scarey in my opinion"	Cipro was started while waiting for the results of a urine culture after it was found that I had blood in my urine and I had a high white blood cell count in the urine specimen. The thought was I had a severe infection so she opted to hit it hard with the most potent medicine available
4004	celexa	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	when the drug actually kicked in, after about 10 days as i recall, it was an amazing experience.I got out of bed and was walking to the bathroom to shower. I was whistling!!!I stopped and thought, hey whats going on here. I realized I felt great, like a heavy weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I felt better than i had felt for a hell of a long time. Never forget it, a fantastic feeling.Truly helped me to cope with the stress of business and relationships.I have recommended it two occasions both had a similar experience to my own.	quite severe night sweats and yawning,dry mouth,ejaculation disorder (not always a bad thing)	not sure what you mean by this. Was in relationship counceling and the psycologist suggested I was depressed as well as stressed. she suggested citalopram. saw my gp who prescribed it. never looked back. I did slide back in to depression a couple of years after first taking the drug but recognised the symptoms and got another script from my doctor with the same positive results.
602	risperdal	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	bi-polar mania with anger issues	it controls my anger pretty good.	NO SEX DRIVE whatsoever.. NO energy, just apathy. always hungry. muscle pain, my mind is a total blank. no interest in living a life..	i started out on 1 mg a day. then this clinic upped it to 3 mg once a day.. this is over a 10 yr. period. finally in 2009, this MD upped it to 6 mg a day, just in case. that is it. i am a zombie. i am trying to cut back to 3 mg, a day. i have NO LIFE!!! my wife seems to hate me because of loss of sex.. i dont blame her.. there are other anti-psychotics out there. resperidone is the WORST one...
2194	clonazepam	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety insomnia	reduction of anxiety, better sleep quality, reduced gi symptoms (stress related)	Drowsiness in the morning.	Initially this drug was prescribed short term for a significant life crisis.  I did not use it much as such, I did not feel short term effects for daytime use.  I did, however, learn that taking 1 mg prior to bed would better the quality of my sleep, stop me from waking up in the middle of the night with anxiety and allow me to sleep longer. Overall, this improvement in sleep quality allowed me to function better in the daytime thus allowing me to deal with the stressors on hand.  I have reduced the dose to .5 mg nightly with the same effects and less morning drowsiness.  I intend to continue to lower the dose until I am off it entirely.  That said, if the sleep disorder/anxiety returns, I will not hesitate to return to using the drug.  Hope this helps someone.
3289	zoloft	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depresson/anxiety	It works very well for anxiety. As for depression, it works but when I get into an episode of MAJOR depression, it seems to be somewhat ineffective at those times.	Dry mouth	When one of my past psychiatrists tried to get me off of Zoloft, I was okay for a while, but then after a month or so I developed considerable anxiety and depression and had to get back on Zoloft for that to subside. In other words... Zoloft is highly addictive when you have considerable anxiety/depression.
2520	motrin	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	severe headache	Ibuprofen generally took away the pain especially when taken early in the onset of the severe headaches.  At times when the pain was already established prior to taking the medication the pain was less effective - sometimes mildly and at other times not at all effective. Ibuprofen in this dose was the medication that best took away the headache pain over any other medication. If it did not work I might try an over-the-counter acetominophin (sp) product.  These were sometimes effective for mild headaches but for the severe headaches if ibuprofen didi not work, generally nothing did.	There did not seem to be any side effects of the ibuprofen. I almost always tried to make sure and eat something or drink milk when taking the medication as indicated to take with food.  I didn't experience any problems even when taking the maximum dosage suggested, 3 within a 24 hour period.	I get severe headaches about every two or three months that can last for three to four days.  Sometimes the most sever headaches seem to be what I call a combination headache, wherein I may be experiencing the routine headache associated with premenstrual cycle but may also be effected by sinus or seasonal weather/ pressure changes or tension headache.  It seems the hardest to treat is the combination of the premenstrual headache with the sinus headache.  I often took both ibuprofen and an over the counter sinus headache medication with some effectiveness.  There have been a few times when nothing took the headache away all day and I may even vomit just from the pain. Some severe headaches were accompanied by sensitivity to light, noise or even smells.
1044	vyvanse	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	focus	..	..	"I am 27, When I was in 9th grade I became ill with lyme disease. It was so severe that I was out of school for two years, and instead of going back to school and graduating HS at the age of 20 I got my GED and joined the Army. I had a MOS that did not require much thinking on your own. And because of that I was very successful. I made rank quick, was very respected, became the NCO of the year twice, became a Drill Sgt. and because of all my military success I had no problem getting into a tier one college. out of all my deployments and undescribable situations Ive been in, nothing compared with the stress of college. once identifying that I had a learning problem. I was prescribed Vyvanse.
I am now going into my senior year and I am ranked in the top 5% of my class. Vyvanse has given me focus and direction. With the good comes the bad. I have lost alot of muscle(I think it all went to my brain). I become aggressive and some times its hard to put into check before I lose control.
and I always have the desire to drink alcohol. For the most part I am able to have self control, but its not easy. I plan on continuing Vyvanse through Grad school. I would recommend this drug, You just need to have a good sense of self awareness, and keep your eye on the prize."

It also indirectly boosts mood by allowing some level of function during a chronic illness where things can easily spiral downward.	There were no side affects until reached 600 mg / day.  This is above the normal dose but within dosing guidelines.	It was a shot in the arm without any side affects. It is NOT a magic bullet but can provide some relief in a chronic situation.

1504	metrogel	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	rosecea	less red spots, helped remove red spots...which were usually worse after hot shower, but I enjoy that so I use the metrogel after that when symptoms are worse and it seems to help. I enjoy  coffee, wine, hot spices, hot showers, really only limit sun exposure and the rosecea seems better. Also in the morning if I notice red spots it seems to help.	none	rub into red areas 1-2 times a day
3502	maxalt	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraines	"After about an hour, headaches disappear. This drug works better for me than other drugs taken before the year 2000, such as Imitrex and Zomig which I took for migraines. Imitrex sped up my heart which scared me. Zomig took 2 hours to work for me.
Maxalt changed my life as I finally am able to function instead of wasting a whole day in a dark room in tears from the pain of migraine. I do not miss work days anymore."	"Dry mouth and increased appetite which is preferable to the throbbing head pain and nausea of migraine.
Sometimes I feel a bit sleepy but not so much that I cannot function or drive. Maxalt is more gentle on my system than Imitrex and Zomig. On rare occasions, I have to take 2 Maxalt in a 24 hour period. I do not feel addicted in any way. I always carry Maxalt with me just in case. Works best at first sign of migraine."	In the 70's and 80's I just had to suffer from the pain and miss work days and cry in a dark room. I would take OTC sleep aids just to escape the agony. Found a Dr who prescibed Imitrex about 1989 which helped, but then in the late 90's my new doctor who also was a migraine sufferer suggested I try Maxalt and it has been what I prefer. My headaches are fewer now, probably because of Menopause which I am now using bio-identical hormones, biest and progesterone.
782	naproxen	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	arthritis	I fractured of my ankle 30 years ago and about 3 years ago I developed arthritis in the same joint (but nowhere else) which was very painful and caused swelling, redness and reduced movement.  I tried all sorts of treatment (aspirin, ibuprofen and a number of recommended natural remedies, the best of which can be said they made things no worse).  I was prescribed naproxen and this has worked really well, so much so that I have thought on a couple of occasions that I have been 'cured', but within a few days of stopping the tablets twinges reappear.	None noticed	One 500mg tablet twice a day
988	antivert	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	dizzyness,, vertigo, nausea,	Restored me from total incapacitation to a full function.	Some drowsiness until I got used to it.  The side effects are totally insignificant compared to the benefits.  I usually take 50 mg at bedtime. The side effect of slight drowsiness is actually beneficial as I get to sleep faster and can function the next day with out the horrendous effects of dizziness, vertigo and nausea.	I had my first episode of incapacitating dizziness, vertigo, nausea and vomiting in about 1972. I was a practicing Orthopedic Surgeon at the time. I was bed, flat on my back for about two weeks, when a fellow M.D. prescribed meclizine for me. Within a few days I was back at work, fully functional.  Since then I have ad about three significant episodes of acute dizzy, nausea and vertigo.  Each as been less severe.  At the onset I take as many 50 mg meclizine tablets as I need to stop the process in its tracks. That can be up to 6 to 8 tabloids.   Once the ephisode passes, usually in a fe days, I go back to my routine of one tablet at night. This drug has been a true godsend for me.
3146	tylenol	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	headache	I believe that there are multiple treatment benefits of Taking Tylenol for my headache. Tylenol is safe, inexpensive, and does not require a physicians prescription. Additionally, it is available almost everywhere and therefor is convenient.	There were no treatment side effects from me taking Tylenol for my headache.	There are no deatails to report. My headache was gone within 30 minutes.

"Sleepiness; feeling ""out of it"" or not quite connected. It is not possible to work or drive when on the medication. Must be taken at night or when you don't need to perform (such as on long flights)."	Take Xanax an hour before an anxiety inducing situation, or at night to reduce panic/anxiety attacks until the Lexpro kicked in (about a month). After taking Lexpro for several weeks, the Xanax was no longer necessary.

749	flonase	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	nasal allergy	For many years, every Spring I would get very troublesome nasal allergy symptoms--tingling,burning, itching, sneezing, etc. After a few days, these symptoms went away. It really surprised me because I had tried many other medicines that didn't work, that also caused severe drowsiness and dry-mouth. Some years my symptoms were so bad that I couldn't go out to a restaurant or movie because I was sneezing so much. Taking this medicine gave me my life back!	I experienced no side effects at all from this nasal spray. This was great  because I had significant side effects from all the pills I had ever tried for my hay fever/nasal allergies (dry mouth and drowsiness).	One or two squirts of the spray into each nostril once a day during allergy season.
2790	wellbutrin	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	The medication treated the depression without the sexual side-effects that accompanied several other medications for depression.	Unfortunately, the drug seemed to correlate with an increased severity of a pre-existing condition: tinnitus. The tinnitus which was moderate to begin with became severe and ultimately led me to stop taking the medication. The tinnitus, though still present, is markedly less severe and decreased almost immediately after stopping the medication.	I was prescribed Wellbutrin, was on it for approximately 5 months and gradually stopped over the course of a few days.
1947	hyzaar	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hypertension	Pills helped to lower my blood pressure.  Also helped to relieve water retention.

Not anything major however. sexual functions and urination were just fine.	The prescription was to take a tablet twice a day. I felt more comfortable taking it once  a day instead.
1178	prozac	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Lessening of suicidal ideation and an increased ability to complete daily life tasks.	There was a decreased ability to have orgasms and a general numbing not quite stupor in which I existed. There was also a major decrese in appetite.	This drug resulted in an unanticipated weightloss of over 20lbs - I went from 128 to 108 lbs. The weight loss decresed the incidences of bulimia. The drug was effective in that I no longer felt depressed per se, but then I didn't feel much of anything. Any combination with alcohol should be avioded - majorly increases its effects!
2239	allegra	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hives	the hives were controlled	afternoon tiredness and sleepiness I usually do not experience.	"I am to take this in the morning daily.  I am afraid to stop it because I fear the hives will return, but the sleepiness and lethargy in the afternoon is not pleasant.  I am considering cutting the tablet in two.  I have stopped the pill altogether for a few days to see what happens since I was told to ""take as needed""."
1307	fexofenadine	2	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	allergic rhinitis	There were no benefits as the sniffling, dripping, coughing continued even on the medicine.	Dry mouth.	Perscribed to help with the following symptoms: drippy nose, sinus congestion, post nasal drip, coughing, and sneezing. Medicine was taken as directed with no real help. The only side effect was being a little dry.
3529	lunesta	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	ptsd/insomnia	"For years I was sleep deprived due to working conditions.  Rarely would I enjoy the luxury of a full night sleep. Typically I would take hours to get to sleep and had extreme difficulty remaining asleep. Dreams were too realistic and often I would be more tired in the morning than upon retiring to bed. Taking Lunesta has allowed me not only to get to sleep but return to sleep.  If I wake in the middle of the night, for example to go to the bathroom, I am awake and not stumbling. The vivid dreams are gone and I have experienced no groggy or hungover symptoms that you sometimes hear of when taking sleep medication. 
It has truly changed my life and I am so grateful for my Dr. for his prescription."	It has been over a year and I have yet to see any side effects, other than increasing the dosage from 2-3mg.	One tablet, taken each night when I was already in bed and ready for sleep.
851	ritalin-la	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	adhd	This medication enabled me to think clearly.  My thought processes were more coherent.  It assisted me in concentrating and therefore I was able to complete tasks --- finally had follow-thru! I was able to manage my time better.

None	I had been off birth-control for a year & hadn't gotten pregnant so my OB/GYN recommended I take this drug to regulate my ovulation.
3375	lipitor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high cholesteral	It lowered my cholesteral considerably.  My total cholesteral was over 300 and my LDLs were over 200, but after being on Lipitor for three months, my total cholesteral is now 186 and my LDL is 86, so I am in good shape.  In addition, I have experienced NO side effects whatsoever, so I am pleased.  The only drawback is that it does not come in generic form, so my co-pay is $40.00 per month.	I experienced NO side effects whatsoever.  I have been on many medications over the last 10 years and normally experience at least some small side effect, but have not with Lipitor.  I do get my liver function tested every few months, and so far it has been fine.  This is not a problem for me as the benefits outweigh any hassle of getting tested.	I take 10 mg of Lipitor daily and get a liver function test every three months.  So far, this has been fine, but I will need to be tested continually as long as I take Lipitor.  I don't mind this, as the benefit of having a healthy cholesteral level is more important to me than any hassle of getting tested.  If at some point my liver function appears to be unhealthy, I'm guessing my doctor will have to reevaluate my situation, but for now, it's fine.
3162	prednisone	5	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	severe hives angiodema	When i was having a severe reaction normal antihistamines would not stop it so i needed to use panfacort which stopped problem within 30 minutes and the residual effects lasted on a a day or two.	felt ill at times , lightheaded.	"Took this when i had idiopathic urticaria and angiodema. At first it wsa prescribed inthe short term to try to ""Dampen"" my immune system but it didnt help. I kept using then sporadically to help when a severe reaction was coming on or i needed to be problem free for the day. Helped at the time but was not a long term solution"
82	ventolin-hfa	1	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	asthma	None	Increased difficulty breathing, strange taste.	I have a prescription for albuterol for sports related asthma. I usually get the Proair inhaler but the pharmacist insisted this was the same and gave it to me. The first day I had it, I went for a run. As usual, about 10 minutes in my chest begins to tighten and I cannot breath. I took a puff of the Ventolin HFA inhaler. No effect. I stopped running. I took another puff. No effect. Still cannot breath. I am now bent over with my hands on my knees struggling to intake air. I took several more puffs from the inhaler. No effect. I am now struggling to remain conscious, I am getting light headed and everything in my vision is pale. I begin to lay on my back, taking a few more puffs of the inhaler. No effect. My throat is now beginning to seize from the sheer force it takes to inhale tablespoon-sized breaths. I have a headache and hear a high pitched whining. I try several more puffs of my inhaler. No effect. I lay on the ground doing controlled breathing for several minutes. I tried a puff of Ventolin HFA here and there with no effect, so I gave it up. I'm laying wondering if this is my last day on Earth. About 15 minutes of pure agony later I catch my breath slightly. I now have an enormous headache and am dizzy. I get to my feet and start to walk toward my apartment (across the street). Along the way, my chest seizes up a couple more times, and a couple more times I use the inhaler. No effect. I now have to wait another month before I can afford a ProAir inhaler before I can even exercise again. I think Ventolin is for underdeveloped little kids who think they have asthma but actually don't. I have real asthma and this stuff almost killed me. The puff that comes out of it is nearly invisible, the puff from a Proair inhaler is actually noticeable and...a 'puff'--about 15x more comes from the Proair compared to the Ventolin. Even waking up in the morning, the slight tightness I have then, Ventolin does nothing for. My girlfriend doesn't understand why I wheeze before AND AFTER I use the Ventolin. Well, it's because it doesn't work for me--in fact, it almost killed me. Everything in this story is true, but I may have taken more puffs from the inhaler than I listed...any ?'s feel free to contact me: thecrookfromthebrook at yahoo.com. Thank you and take care.
1379	biaxin	5	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	sinus infection	My sinus infection felt better, although being unclogged, I constantly am spitting up mucus (especially after eating or drinking anything but water).	Metallic taste in mouth, Constant back pain, slight Nausea, Constant Tinnitus (nonstop ringing in ears), irritable (possibly due to lack of sleep due to the tinnitus and back pain), continuous stomach pain (strong after eating).  The ringing in my ears and back pain(thoracic region) is driving me crazy, but I have to stick it out so that if treated again with this antibiotic in the future, it will be successful.  Counting down the days!!!  I just keep looking at pictures of the beach.	twice a day , 7 days
750	flonase	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	congestion	I have rhinitis almost all year long. Usually it gets worse in the cold season. I have tried many other medicines, but they either have too much side effect, or don�t work for me at all. This nasal spray clears the congestion in 10 minutes, doesn't last for the whole night, but the pretty pleasant smell make me feel good.	as any other drugs that suppress the immune system, I believe the fluticasone Propionate nasal spray is also make people more susceptible to infections than health individuals. But I guess if the congestion is so bad that one cannot get a quality sleep, it does more harm than the side effect of the nasal spray.	I started using it right before last Christmas, hoping to get better before the holiday. It cleared the congestion for the a few hour after the first time I used it. I keep using it twice a day. for about five days and my nose became much less stuffy and less runny. I didn't completely treat my rhinitis, but I could sleep better. I am happy with the result.
809	ambien	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	insomnia	Definitely made me fall asleep. Very fast acting, about 10 minutes after taking it, I feel groggy.	"MEMORY LOSS. If you don't go to sleep immediately after feeling groggy, you will continue on with your life unbeknownest to you! I called people I never call, ate lots of food, watched movies, and had conversations, all of which I haven't the slightest recollection of. 
It is my belief that the long term memory effects must parallel the short term. 
Also I experienced vivid nightmares and hallucinations.
Habit forming despite denial of drug company."	Recreational drug. Not worth the side effects for the benefit. Try something natural, tylenol PM, or any other sleep aid but this one!
2356	propecia	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hairloss	All but stopped my hair loss.  After a couple of months I noticed that i had virtually no hair in my hands after washing it as opposed to 25-30 hairs before... also no more hair on my pillow, whereas before is was quite obvious it was falling out. Visually there is no more loss.  I don't know if it is growing back, but as long as it stays i'm cool...	I havent had any side effects that people have claimed, and erectile function is normal. Also, my sex drive was relatively low before, so i dont think that has changed.	one a day.... rarely miss a day...  like some people, I dont like taking a pill everyday, but...  but 2 dollars a day to keep your hair... definitely worth it!
1000	armour-thyroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	mild hypothyroidism	cost savings and more control versus combo of Levoxyl and Cytomel.  Without insurance, I got my doctor to write a year's worth Rx and ordered in from Canada.	None with Armour.  Cytomel got out of hand and I lost too much weight and my hair started to fall out.  Armour is more naturally balanced.	ongoing medication, helps get circulating T3 into my system, boosts metabolism and energy, makes me fee normal.
2498	remeron	3	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression	Hardly any except I felt so physically tired that I couldn't even feel depressed.	I was so exhausted that I could hardly get out of bed and get to work. At work, I just wanted to put my head down and go to sleep. As soon as I got home around 6pm, I had to go to bed. It was ridiculous.	I just started treatment for severe depression. I sleep okay, but have nightmares all night, which is why my doctor recommended Remeron. I am going to ask for a change in this because even though it has only been a few days, I am barely functional.
141	valtrex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	recurring cold sores	This works EVERY time I get a cold sore. Stops the cold sore in it's tracks, immediately!!! Took one at first sign of tingling. Now that I have a prescription, I rarely get them anymore.	No side effects, cold sores disappeared.	Take two 1 gram tablets at first sign of cold sore, take 2 more 12 hours later. That's it... cold sore is completely gone!
866	valium	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	muscle pain/spasms - legs	medication allowed the patient to relax and helped reduced pain in legs. This resulted in reduction of Restless Legs Syndrome and also allowed the patient to have a good nights sleep. Minimal soreness in legs next morning.	Slight groginess next morning.	Take 5 mg valium between half hour and hour before retiring for the night. Only use when leag pain is going to disrupt sleep.
1485	cymbalta	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	dystimia	"When you are in a mild depression or dystimia the worst thing is that you are unable to think or concentrate, you feel sleep and tired all the day. It's like 
having a permament cloud in your mind. I think that this treatment is helping me a lot: now I have a sharper mind, I feel more energetic and I can concentrate properly."	The most annoying side side is insomnia and tremor. I take deprax to induce sleep but even with it I woke up very early. You can get used to some side effects like dry mouth, vivid dreaming and weight loss but tremor, although not serious, is very noticeable. I experienced delayed ejaculation at the begining but not now.	The treatment consists of Cymbalta 60mg and Deprax 50 mg, but it has been changed many times. The most difficult has been to induce sleep for some hours without feeling too sleepy in the morning. I tried with Loramet and Diazepam but their effect last too much, it's impossible to concentrate. Deprax 100mg is the best I've taken to sleep. Now I'm taking just 50mg and I don't fall sleep so quick but it's fine, I have enough rest.
1326	prevacid	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	I can eat and drink more normally without as much acid reflux and vomitting.  My condition results in slow digestion and intollerance of some foods.  With prevacid, I eat small amounts and avoid irritants.  I have had refluz episodes in my sleep.  With religious use of prevacid, this rarely occurs.  I can eat a larger variety of foods. It has made a positive difference in my quality of life.	I have not experienced negative physical side effects that I am aware of.  This drug does not aid with digestion of food.  I still have nausea and vomitting but, not because the drug doesn't work.  My doctor explained my other symptoms result from food in stomach several hours after eating.	I have tried every prescription medication for acid in stomach and had gall bladder removed.  I have modified my diet and avoid irritating foods and drinks.  With prevacid twice daily (normal dosage is once daily) I can eat and drink with less nausea.  Without it, my diet would have to be clear liquids and pulverized solids.  It has made a tremendous positive difference.  I do not want to stop taking it unless something better is approved.  It is not a treatment for the paresis.  Reglan is the only FDA approved prescription drug for my condition that I am aware of.  I cannot use it without horrible side effects.
1643	sumatriptan	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	got rid of migraine pretty quickly, in about half an hour, but was not as good as imitrex, the brand name. Imitrex would get rid of the migraine more quickly and more completely.   There would be times, perhaps one out of three, where I would  consider taking two of the 50 mg sumatriptans	fatigue- more pronounced when I first started taking this drug	I take sumatriptan at the onset of a migraine.   It works best if I am just beginning to notice the pain over my eye.
4148	percocet	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	buldging/ruptured disc	Pain is now under control to some degree.  Still have pain throughout body and down legs.  Before the medication I would not be able to get out of bed for sometimes days.  Even when I could get out of bed I would not be able to sit up or walk for more than 30 minutes before I had to lay down.  Now I am able to be up all day, walk and sit up for more than 3-4 hours at a time.	"It sometimes makes me feel ""high"", vision problems, coordination problems."	Switch from Percocet to Lortab every 3 months.
509	pentasa	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	pentasa	Pentasa seems to be an effective anti-inflammatory drug, minimizing pain in my intestines/colon.  I have been close to remission for a couple of years now, and I attribute it primarily to the Pentasa.	I don't feel as though I have any discernible side-effects with Pentasa, but when paired with Purinethol I do have side effects such as extreme fatigue and headaches, leading me to believe the problem lies with the Purinethol. I do have intermittent constipation, which could be attributable to a number of factors in my life, but is also a side-effect of Pentasa. I also have mild headaches, muscle pain, and anxiety which are listed as possible side-effects with Pentasa, but to the best of my knowledge these symptoms were occuring prior to my starting Pentasa.  Perhaps the Pentasa exacerbates the problems, I don't know.  I know that I do worry about kidney problems, which is one of the more serious side-effects of this medicine.	"Twelve years ago I became ill with what was diagnosed two years later (!) as Crohn's disease.  I have used a variety of medications, ranging from more serious drugs (Prednisone, Remicade)to less ""harmful"" drugs (Metronidazole, Ciprofloxacin, Asacol, etc.). I have been on the Pentasa for about 8 years, during which time I was using Purinethol for several years.  A year or so ago I weaned myself off of the Purinethol and remained on the highest dose of Pentasa for my weight, and I am doing well (knock on wood).  I have constipation issues as opposed to my previous diarrhea problems, which may be attributable to the Pentasa, and is manageable through diet and over-the-counter aids."
3129	cytomel	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	I am now wide awake--for the first time in YEARS!!!  My body aches have lessened greatly.  I am alert.  I can keep up with the housework.  I have a better memory, concentration, and overall mood.  I have regained my creativity.  My appetite/desire to overeat has decreased, though I still have an appetite.  I just eat like a normal person, now.  I don't suffer from emotional or boredom eating.  I am steadily losing weight--8 lbs. so far.  I also have the energy and desire to exercise, something that I couldn't do before.  I feel like someone handed me my life back!	It took time to figure out when to take the medicine.  From everything I've read, I am supposed to take it in the morning.  But, that made me wide awake, even at night, and it interfered with my meal schedule.  So, now I take it around 11 P.M.  I still sleep well, something new for me, and can easily wake up, feeling alert throughout the day.  I've NEVER felt this way before.  It's awesome!	"Synthroid--50 mcg. + Liothyronine--25 mcg., both daily, around 11 P.M.
+
magnesium--400 mg. + Vitamin D3 (alternating between 2000 mg. and 4000 mg.), daily   (My body's not absorbing the Vit. D3 very well--will get rechecked in a week.)

Have these levels checked by your doctor.  90% of people are deficient in Vitamin D and low in magnesium.  These are essential to your body's wellness."
3020	cipro	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	epidimytis	Got rid of my raging epidimytis and prostatitis. The pain started to subside within 2-3 days. Within the first week almost all symptoms were gone. Minor symptoms persisted until the 11-12 day. By the 14th day all symptoms were gone. BUT - the side effects were awful.	"Let it be known that I have been treated once before with ciprofloxacin, where I experienced no side effects. This time was a little different...

- muscle pains in thighs, chest, and traps. 
- tightness of chest 
- joint pains - specifically on the outsides of my knees. some pain in wrists, elbows, and upper back.
- semi severe pain in lymph nodes of neck w/ little to no swelling.
- complete anxiety that i had lympoma; both swollen lymph nodes and anxiety are side effects of Cipro
- general anxiety
- made me poo a lot. (kinda funny in retrospect)
- low sex drive
- pain in lower rib cage, a little higher than the kidneys. could not identify weather muscular or otherwise.
- pain in diaphragm
- pain in neck
- pain in upper jaw (only experienced this once for about an hour)
- pain in jaw would often radiate to pain in temples
- ringing in ears/dulled hearing (this would last for about 5 minutes at a time)
- very slight muscle twitching (only sometimes)
- i would get ""pins and needles"" very easily
- i was colder than normal for the entire two weeks
- i was very irritable - but i can't decide if my short temper was a side effect of the drug, or if it was caused by the drag of having so many side effects.

Other than the frequent bowel movements, I had no stomach or nausea problems. My bowel movements were very normal, and stomach aches were never an issue. 

All of the side effects became persistently worse, starting off as very minor side effects and progressing to a moderate stage. Some of the side effects (particularly the lymph node pain) didn't start until the second week."	14 days of this crazy drug solved my infection, but the side effects were killer. Ask your doctor about alternatives before starting ciprofloxacin.
3338	clarithromycin	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	strep throat	Immediately took the pain from the Strep away.	Terrible taste in mouth, 4 and a half hours of constant dry-heaving, painful and sudden headaches, body aches.	The side effects were so terrible, never felt so badly in my entire life. WOuldnt recommend for anyone unless they have a strong stomach
1774	citalopram	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety disorder	I sufffered from dibilatating panic attacks, but they only lasted 15-20 minutes max. I was taking klonopin every once and awhile which helped a little, but by the time the klonopin kicked in the attack was over. It got to where I had an attack at least every other day. The Citalopram kicked in in about 2 weeks and I've had only 1 episode since, granted I've only been on it for 2 months but it has worked wonders for me.	None that I have noticed.	20 mgs. once a day.
1203	prozac	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Less depressed, I could consintrate on daily life better. I was happier, less anxious, stopped worrying so much.	I felt manic at times, surreal. I was thirsty a lot, and forgot to eat.	I was suppose to take 20mg daily for treatment of depression, it helped my depression but i often felt manic and 'not myself'
1206	prozac	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	pms	none, I felt worse. This is probably a drug that works for some people but didn't work at all for me in fact I felt much much worse. Unfortunately, I didn't review the contraindications.	I got a rash on the back of my neck that lasted for 1 year even though I only took Prozac for 2 months. Also, I couldn't sleep as a result of taking Prozac. It seemed like after I stopped taking it I still had it in my body because I couldn't get rid of the rash on my neck and it was very annoying. Thhis is the first time that anything like this has ever happened to me.	i took it once a day for PMS
121	valtrex	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	herpes	To lessen the severity of an onset or outbreak of genital herpes.	I had no noticable side effects to taking the medication.	I started taking the medication at the first signs of an outbreak (usually a brief sharp pain at the site). The medication seemed to shorten the actual outbreak time and lessened the pain and discomfort.
2580	klonopin	4	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	anxiety	Less depression.  Had more energy to do things.  Able to get involved in activities that I would otherwise not engage in.	Had daytime drowsiness.  Constipation.  Had to take a stool softner on a daily basis.  Lowered my blood pressure a little.  Slowed my heartbeat a little bit. Increased appetite.  I gained twenty pounds in a little over two years.  It slowed my metabolism.  I could eat one low calorie meal in a day and not lose one pound.	I would see a psychiatrist once a month.  The doctor would ask me how I was feeling and would change the dosage if neccesary.
1772	citalopram	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I feel that the citalopram helps keep me calm. I no longer have mood swings as often. No longer feel the need to just stay at home bymyself. No longer want to leave work because of depressed moods.	First 2 days wicked nasea. I do sweat more than usual. Trouble sleeping at times.	I started taking 20mg pills for a few months. I noticed that it would feel as though it was wearing off by 7pm or so. My doctor prescribed me up to 30mg for a week and then to 40mg for the rest of the month. Things seem better than on the 20mg. However I still get depressed at times and nothing seems to ever go right. Perhaps therapy will help which my doctor mentioned. Going to continue on the 40mg for a few more months and see if it helps if not I will make another apt at the doctor and see what she thinks weather we want to try and up the dose or try something different.
3304	zoloft	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"Highly motivated vs my previous state of, ""why do I get up in the morning""? Nothing upset me- even something that would put down a generally happy person."	Harder to climax, although I didn't necessarily lose interest in sex drive.

4121	chantix	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	smoking	WOW. I find this drug to be a powerful cocaine antagonist and nicotine antagonist.	mild constipation but relieved with fiber rich diet and liquids, strange taste and some deja vu/strange mental sensations. Cocaine Antagonist (positive)	"I took this drug with the intentions of quitting smoking. I also however, discovered on accident that this drug just about completely blocked the euphoric effects of cocaine and then subsequently blocked the ""crash"". All that would be experienced was a racy heart and undesirable ""too much caffeine"" feeling with nausea. This drug has a SERIOUSLY powerful effect on the euphoric of stimulants and needs to immediately be put into treatment plans for stimulant abuse. For Its indications, nicotine, It definately does its job here too my cravings for nicotine are pretty much extinguished though there still seems to be slight reward in an occasional cigarette, just goes to show how much I feel this drug stabilized my ADHD downsides such as deficient dopamine function in my brain. It worked better than bupropion. I understand Chantix has some issues with side effects but hopefully they will work those kinks out because this really looks to be a miracle drug."

206	elidel	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	skin rash	It was a cream base that was easy to apply, twice a day.  It seemed to help with an allergic skin rash due to detergent irritation.  It was not as strong as a higher dosage cortisone cream, but it was still effective.  There were no side effects of note.  The cost was higher than over the counter preparations.  All in all, it was a good choice for stubborn skin irritation issues.	None	Apply thin layer twice per day.   Non oily, cream based formula.
1660	climara	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	menopausal	Climara patch almost completely stopped the severe hot flashes and severe vaginal dryness. It also has improved skin tone and elasticity, moderated mood, improved sleep (by decreasing hot flash frequency). The side-effect of pain in liver area from estradiol by mouth has gone away using a dermal patch.	The only side effect from the Climara is mild itching after removing the patch. Another side effect is actually produced by the progesterone I have to take to balance the estrogen, and that is an aggravation of my IBS - abdominal pain, gas, bloating. So I take the progesterone only 7 days/month now and the side effects are minimal.	After being miserable with frequent (20+ times/day, 7-10 times/night) and severe hot flashes (sometimes like a sudden sunburn, skin turning red and burning) for a number of years, I went on hormone replacement therapy. Estrogen by mouth had more side effects, so I went on the patch, which I have to change only once a week. The recommended accompanying treatment of progesterone caused more problems than the estrogen: a combination patch which is available is more convenient, but I found by trying it that progesterone really aggravates my IBS symptoms. To lessen that effect, I went on an estrogen-only patch and use a separate progesterone only 7 days/month. This is currently making me have periods again, not a fun thing, but I feel much better overall because my IBS symptoms are much less severe and less frequent.
1954	lyrica	8	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	fibromyalgia	I feel alot less pain taking the Flexeril (only at night) and the Lyrica.	I feel sleepy and have days where in have trouble concentrating.	For Fibromyalgia, in the morning I take half of a multi-Vitamin and 50mg of Lyrica. 5 days out of 7 days, I excercise for 20 to 30 minutes on a tredmill. In the evening, I take half a multi-Vitamin, 100mg of Lyrica, and 5mg of Flexeril
3046	seroquel	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bipolar ii	Seroquel is the first medication that really seemed to work for me. I have taken it along with several different combinations of meds, but the Seroquel has remained in my regimen for the past 5 years. I play with the dosage and make my own changes (25 mgs at a time) based on how I'm doing, so I've taken between 200 and 400 mgs at any given time. The effects I attribute to the Seroquel include lessening of depression, anxiety and aggression.	Dry mouth, vivid dreams (I remember most of my dreams from the past 5 years), extreme lethargy (the Wellbutron helps counteract that)	I currently take 200 mgs at night before bed along with 200 mgs of Lamictal and Wellbutron. No therapy anymore.
1332	prevacid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	excess stomach acid.	Reduced acid production to normal levels.	At prescribed level of 30 mg/day I suffered fatigue and bacterial overgrowth in the stomach. At half this dose I was fine. But, needed dosage levels are different for different people.	The secret of taking proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor inhibitors lies in finding the right dosage and the right time of day to take it. Zoton Fast Tabs are tablets which dissolve on the tongue and can be broken to alter the dosage. I found that half my prescribed dosage of 30 mgs/day was enough for me and so break the tablet in two.
3401	proscar	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	bph	my urination problems (urgency , frequency , etc ) practically disappeared and I no longer had get off my bed to urinate several times during the night	there were none	I took one pill a day every evening with a glass of water after dinner .The treatment was supervised by a proctologist
3051	seroquel	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bipolar disorder / insomnia	"Initially I was prescribed it to knock me the hell out after 4 days of beautifully manic insomnia. Then after the mixed episode ended they spiked the dose over the course of a few months to 300, where it sits. 

The effects, compared to when I was in the episode I'm very stable. Occasional bouts of mild, often topical depression, but otherwise okay. 
As for insomnia, it's gotten to the point where I'm almost dependent on it to sleep. Considering beforehand, even while not in a noted phase I would have serious problems sleeping, this is a welcome effect."	"I'm very slow to get going in the morning. I often hit my snooze alarm 10-12 times (only 5 minutes a piece), but that could also stem from setting my alarm 3 hours before I have to be anywhere.

The worst problem of it all is that it stuffs up my sinuses to the point where I can't breathe through them when getting to sleep. Combine that with dry mouth and you get some very uncomfortable nights. I've found that keeping a supply of corn chips and water next to my bed counteracts the dry mouth until I go unconscious and stop caring.

Also, something which I'm not sure if I can blame the seroquel for; I sometimes get very mild but discomforting pains just under my left collarbone. Not like heart-chest pain (from what I'd imagine it's like), but a different pain. Hopefully my heart doesn't explode randomly."	"Dec 08- Zoloft, sparked a 3 week long mixed phase with psychotic features. 4 days into it I was prescribed 25 mg seroquel.

Jan 09-April 09, Increasing doses of Seroquel, up to 300. Also Wellbutrin, starting at 50 and eventually reaching 300. The wellbutrin made me considerably more depressed than I was before, and I stopped taking it. Since then it's been the seroquel, and I've been mostly stable since."
3322	danazol	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	ovarian cyst	After a month taking, the cyst is shrinking considerably. It was a few cm big. By the end of three months, the cyst was completely gone. I'm cyst free since then.	It stopped my menstrual cycle but after three months, my period came as usual so it's not a big problem. But the worst side effect for me was I got acne which was severe and left pitted scars. Not only that, I noticed my skin (whole body and face) after the acne stopped was very very dry and aged very fast. It took long time for my skin to become somewhat normal again. Hairs on my legs were getting longer and more prominent too. And another side effect was weight gain with enormous appetite which you could feel was not normal appetite. I gained about 8kg and then lost it which result in sagging skin on my face.	The treatment was easy enough. The gynaecologist prescribed Danazol for the ovarian cyst I had and it was very effective. The cyst was gone and didn't come back too.
4023	celexa	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression/panic disorder	I'm only four days in, but I already feel more like myself than I have in a year and a half.  The effects were almost immediate.  I've taken more responsibility, had more energy, and been more outgoing already.	Nausea, Restless Leg Syndrome, dry mouth, teeth clenching, bouts of fatigue, mania (temporary...first night only), insomnia, acne, inability to edit myself in some social situations	With continue chemical therapy using Celexa, I look forward to massive improvement in my overall mood and personality.
269	ditropan	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	incontinence	The medicine has stopped her wetting both day and night and worked within a week of her taking it. She is over the moon and so am I!	My daughter complains of a pain in her bladder area and some constipation and her face looks a little flushed. I am considering lowering the dose to 2x 2.5ml per day	She has had 4 years of bladder infections and has had various scans and tests. I think that she has never been able to read the signals from her bladder properly due to all the infections. This medicine which was prescribed by the dr on a trial basis seems to be working well. We will try to wean her off it slowly after a little while
4090	mobic	3	Ineffective	No Side Effects	neck and back pain/  whiplash	Honestly I have felt no change in my symptoms. If anything it feels as if they are getting worse. I constantly am getting sever headaches and my symptoms have not alleviated. I have not experienced any type of symptoms. I am also extremly tense to where the tendons in my neck do no sit flat.	For me i didnt have any side effects.	1x a day with food & milk
2923	tramadol	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	arthritis	When I began taking Tramadol I had severe Arthritis pain and could not sleep more than 3 hours a night. Tramadol relieves the pain without making you feel drugged up. I had to take up to 6 tylenol or 4 ibuprofens and it still did not touch the pain.	There was mild drowsiness in the beginning or with taking the full allotted doses but no other adverse side effects.	I take 2-4 Trmadol daily for my arthritis pain. Always 1 before bed and one upon waking if I begibn to feel pain during the day I may take another. my blood levels are monitored every 6 months to make sure there is no liver damage from this and/or the Ibuprofen I take.
1364	permapen	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	viral bronchitis	Absolutely no benefits, did not seem to get better even in a week.  Through research I learned that penicillin does not treat a virus and that a virus must run its course.  No idea why my doctor precribed Penicillin.  Would rather he had been on the up and up about it instead of precribing a worthless treatment.	No side effects at all, just took an antibiotic I did not need and do not see any health benefit in that at all	Doctor diagnosed me with Viral Bronchitis after and xray.  He then prescribed Penicillin to treat it.  Worthless treatment, since Penicillin is totally ineffective to fight a virus.
854	trimethobenzamide	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	vertigo	The trimethobenzamide significantly reduced nausea and brought it down to a perceptible but comfortable level.	None.	After being diagnosed with temporary vertigo, I was given prescriptions for this plus Meclizine for dizziness. The two combined brought the vertigo completely under control. There were no side effects. I took the medication as originally prescribed for two days and then, at my doctor's suggestion, reduced the amount to as-needed. The trimethobenzamide made it possible to eat normally, with no uncomfortable feelings of nausea.
1472	cymbalta	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety and depression	"a feeling of caring but not really caring. I feel like i become emotionally involved to deeply and this drug has kept me on the ""surface"" for lack of a better term."	dry mouth and nausea for first 4 days. started taking at night only and didn't notice if it was making me tired, switched to day and seems to make me feel as if i need a nap but i am studying biology right now. might switch to nights again	30mg once a day for 2 weeks, then 60mg
135	valtrex	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	cold sores	If drug is taken at very first sign/symptom of cold sore, the drug will elliminate it within that day. If the cold sore has fully surfaced it will still help to speed healing (usually within a week). This medication is not a cure for cold sores.	I have not noticed any side effects and have been taking this drug for a couple of years. It is important to note, there is no cure for cold sores (herpes). I don't know how the drug works but it seems if I am run down over the course of several weeks I may have to take the drug several times to keep a cold sore from surfacing.	When you first feel a cold sore coming on take 4 pills with water, wait 10 to 12 hrs and then take another 4 pills. I have heard of people taking a daily maintenace dose that should ensure you never see a break out of blisters appearing, however, if not on a drug program, this would be very expensive, and depending on how many times you tend to break out, probably not necessary.
2425	synthroid	3	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism after thyroidectomy	Had to take a thyroid replacement, so it did that, but not as well as I would have expected.	Was very tired, had memory problems, weight gain.  Had trouble moving around, joint pain.	Synthroid was prescribed as thyroid replacment hormone after total Thyroidectomy due to nodules, etc from Graves disease.  Was determined that 75 mcg was the correct dose.  However after 2 years of taking Synthroid and endocrinologist unwilling to try alternative medication, I found another doctor who did some additional testing.  She found that I was low in Free t3 & t4 and the prescribed Armour thyroid.  I feel much better on this thyroid replacement than I did using Synthroid.
1434	tirosint	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	hypothyroidism	No improvement at all in symptoms.	Over the past few months I have developed borderline hypertension, increased bruising, my hair texture and skin continue to worsen.	At 14 I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and this was corrected through medication (thyroid disorders are prevalent in my mother's family).  I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (TSH 14.5) this past December and evidence of an auto immune disorder.  Since, I have been on 50mcg daily, my TSH tests normal but  there has been no improvements in symptoms.
853	nystatin	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	yeast diaper rash	Daily application, cured the fungal infection despite side effects.  Over the counter use of lotrimin AG did no work, and prescription alternaitve medication using miconizole nitrate (same as in monistay) cost upwards of $200 / tube, as my insurance did not cover much of it.	caused localized eczema that had to be treated with hydrocortisone cream, which is risky as that can cause damage to the skin under the diaper area.	had to apply with each diaper change, along with a otc diaper cream or applied with aquaphor, and twice a day had to add the otc hydrocortisone cream.
3158	prednisone	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hives	This medication completely erased symptoms of the hives.  The first time that I took the medication the hives were already 2 days old, therefore, it took about 2 days for them to clear up. Now, if I ever feel the itch or see the blotchiness I can take one dose of this medicine and the hives do not progress and they are clear within one day.	There were no side effects noticed with this medication.	Take 2 tablets once per day.
824	zegerid	5	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	gerd	Reduced symptoms of acid reflux	diarrhea	The insurance company no longer covered Protonix, but substituted Omeprazole. It is not as effective at reducing episodes of acid reflux as Protonix, and the dose had to be doubled to approach the same level of efficacy.
890	paxil	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I believe that I suffered from depression my whole life.  I feel like the first years of my life would have been very different if I had some treatment for my feelings.  My whole family would agree that I am much much happier and have a feeling of peace in my life.	I am not sure if it is only the drug but I have almost no sexual feelings. Could just be my age...who knows.	"I'm not sure what you mean by ""treatment details"" but I saw a psycotherapist for several months and she prescribed the paxil and ok'd the paroxetine.  I share my treatment with anyone because I think that depression is not the best descriptive word for what was troubeling me.  Thanks for your work!"
3809	solodyn	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	acne	Solodyn virtually eliminated any acne I had, both on my face and body.  It took about a month to see dramatic results, but some results were visible within a few days of starting the medication.	I didn't experience any side effects until about four weeks into treatment, at which time I began breaking out in very mild hives.  They were so mild, in fact, that I originally thought they may have been caused by a lotion or cosmetic that had gotten on my skin, or maybe by something I had eaten.  The hives would come and go throughout the day, appearing very sparsely on my face, neck, and/or hands.  A few days passed, and I realized that they must have been caused by the drug, so I stopped taking it and the hives went away after a day or so.  I want to stress that these hives were very mild.  I have had allergic reactions to drugs in the past (which may have made be more susceptible this time) and every previous experience I've had with drug-related hives has been much, much worse and possibly life-threatening if not treated.  Perhaps that would have been the case with these as well if I had continued taking the drug, but they didn't seem to be particularly alarming, just mildly annoying.	I took one pill every morning at the same time each day.
414	imitrex	2	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	migraines	"I initially switched over from Axert since my insurance covers more of the Imitrex prescription.  Imitrex just isn't right for me.  I experienced almost all of the side effects such as flushing, sensations of tingling/prickling, weakness, drowsiness, dizziness, and fast/pounding heartbeat.  On top of that the packaging is just HORRIBLE!  It comes 9 to a package.  The packaging is a tri-fold ""booklet"" that is very rigid and has individual blisters for each tablet.  It's about 6 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches, folded.  I  like to have migraine meds on me at all times so I ended up cutting the tablets out of the booklet so they would fit in my wallet or purse.  Definitely going back to Axert!"	flushing, tingling, prickling, weakness, drowsiness, dizziness and pounding heartbeat.	Take 1 tablet by mouth. Max 2 tabs per 24 hours.
1592	xanax	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety/depression	I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably higher dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck.	lethargy, loss of appetite.	I was started at .5mg, the second strength of dosage, 2 times daily. I became afraid of it because I was taking it to calm me from coming down off opiates, however, I was already on a medication to stop me from taking opiates, which was actually not supposed to be taken with alprazolam because of concerns that both medicines cause respiratory depression.
2237	allegra	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergies	Treatment benefits were the cessation of allergy symptoms such as itchy eyes, itchy ears, itchy throat, sneezing, nasal drip, congestion and borderline asthma; however, during high allergy season, the regular dosage was insufficient, the beneficial effects lasting only about 12 hours, instead of the intended 24.  Then it was required twice daily to relieve symptoms described above.	Increasing the dosage to twice daily during high allergy season resulted in horrible side effects such as severe headache, nervousness, heart palpitations, dizziness, inability to concentrate, irritability, and the loss of appetite. I had to stop taking it altogether for four to five days, before I felt comfortable in taking it again.  Now I take only one/day regardless of the extent of allergies.	Treatment details included, at first, a dosage first thing every morning, around 6am. During moderate allergy season, this lasted me until the following morning, but as soon as I got up at 6, symptoms came on full strength.  The Allegra did not take effect for an hour and a half.  So I started waking up at 5 to take it then, so that as I prepared for work I was able to do so without runny eyes, nose, etc.  But during the heavy allergy season (dogwood), I would take one at 5am and one at 6pm.  Within two weeks the side effects had me back to my regular dosage.
2442	wellbutrin-sr	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	adhd	Motivates, keeps me focused and helps me stay calm and alert in the same time.  Not as noticeable as stimulants but more steady, no ups and downs, and it works round the clock reducing the rebound from when Concerta wears off after approx 10 hours. Stabilizing effect on the mood too.	Insomnia the first week.	Only been on Wellbutrin for three weeks and already feel a difference in my ADHD symptoms. Been on Concerta for years, but needed a drug working round the clock.
747	flonase	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	nasal allergies	It cleared up my nasal allergies, my stuffy nose, post nasal drip and as an added benefit it also helped prevent getting hoarse.	There were no side effects, but I was careful to only use it when needed and not to use it for more than 1 month at a time.	I would use as directed for the first few weeks, then cut the dose in half for maintenance.  It take about a day and a half to start working and about 3 days to work fully.
476	remicade	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	crohn's with fistula in ano	Fistula is considerable reduced. Almost healed. Fluid developing in the fistula is also healed. Frequency of stool passing is also reduced to twice a day.	No major side effect. But itchy scalp and bumps like a pimples in scalp which turned into dried patches/scabs. Weight gain also. Swelling in legs after 1st dose.	"All three doses given through NS (IV). Before given Remicade, Injection efcorlin (Hydrocortisone sodium succinate) were given every time.

Ist dose given for ten minutes and waited for any reaction. No adverse effects were noticed. Then it was completed in 6 Hrs.

IInd dose was given on 2nd week. This dose was completed in 3 Hrs.

IIIrd dose was given on 6th week. This dose was also completed in 3 Hrs."
1960	lyrica	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	neuropathic pain aand fibromyalgia	None	Extreme swelling of face, hands and feet, as well as, raised welts on skin	Patient was being weened off of 3600mg/day of Neurontin on to Lyrica. As the dosage taken of Neurontin lessened and that of Lyrica increased so did the side effects. Patient was taken totally off of Lyrica and, successfully, placed back on Neurontin.
456	phendimetrazine	10	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	weight loss	A total of 20 pounds lost in one month.	Although I reached my goal weight, the drug made me very restless, anxious, moody.  I also experienced headaches, and falling asleep was not easy while on this drug.  Dizziness, light headed.	Take one 35mg pill in the morning and one after lunch to curb appetite.  I fond myself able to stay more active and run longer at the gym. It's a toss up if the results were worth the side effects.  It's obvious that a drug this strong that makes you want to run a marathon and not eat can't be good for you!
1709	retin-a-micro	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Skin became smoother, fewer breakouts	Dry skin was easily remedied with moisturizer.  My skin is aggravated by sunscreens and that concerns me, but using Clinique moisturizer has assisted with the dryness and I have not experienced any irritation.   For sun protection,  I just put on a hat when I am exposed to the sun and thus far I have had to problems with sun irritation.	I use the retin a every night as needed if there is a breakout for about 4 weeks.
766	azopt	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	glaucoma	Although this is not available in generic, I am using the generic versions of alphagan and betagan in conjunction with this drug. Each drug was used independently to determine side effects before they were combined for treatment. (This was a many visit process! But the results have made it was worth it) This combination lowered my intraoccular pressure to the point that it was not necessary to have surgery - my next step since other combinations did not work.	Occasional burning when put into already irritated eyes.	In conjunction with the above mentioned drops, I have had consistently lowered pressure with no side effects.
993	armour-thyroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothryroid	Not as tired, thicker hair, not gaining weight as easily	Have not experienced any yet	Once daily in the am
3179	desyrel	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	poor sleep quality	Able to sleep throughout the night without waking up, not groggy in the morning.	Dry mouth in the morning up on waking, dry eyes.	"I take 50 mg at night 1/2 hour to 1 hour before I want to go to sleep. I stay asleep and don't wake up every hour like I did before starting it. I feel refreshed in the morning. 

It does make my mouth pretty dry, especially first thing in the morning. I also have dry eyes I believe as a result of taking trazodone and it makes it difficult to wear contacts because of the dryness."
793	ambien	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia	I had two arthroscopic surgeries to my right knee with little relief or benefit from the surgery. I was prescribed Ambien 10mg at bedtime as needed to help me sleep. On the nights I didn't take the medicine, I woke up all through the night. With the medicine, I slept well and soundly.	The only side effect I recall, which was very minor, was a sluggish feeling, only if I didn't sleep for a minimum of 7 hours. This was only on one occassion.	Post surgery to my right knee I was in considerable pain, and suffered insomnia because of it. Ambien 10mg was prescribed as needed at bedtime. I took it nightly for the first 3 nights post surgery. On the 4th night, I didn't take it, and woke up all through the night. All in all I took the Ambien a total of 7 out of the first 10 days following the surgery. It helped me to sleep very soundly and the pain didn't interupt my sleep. I had no ill effects from it at all. I still have the remaining 20 tablets that were prescribed one year ago.
2969	niaspan	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hyperlipidemia	My total serum cholesterol dropped from 280 to 198, LDL dropped from 225 to 122, HDL increased from 38 to 57. My triglycerides were already low due to a strict low-carb diet. My blood pressure was already low (104/70) due to verapamil therapy to prevent cluster headaches, and has remained low. I experienced no serum increases in liver enzymes, urea, or sugar.	I experience regular mild flushing, along with mild itching of ears and arms. These effects occur within an hour of dosage, and subside after 20-30 minutes. I do not take aspirin or NSAIDs, nor avoid fatty foods with the medication, as is recommended to reduce the flushing and itching.	I observe a strict Atkins Diet, with regular supplements of a good iron-free multivitamin, calcium citrate-malate, fish oil, glucosamine/chondroitin and coenzyme Q-10. Liberal use of Morton Lite Salt provides good potassium supplementation. I also use a psyllium-husk fiber supplement to consume  7g of soluable fiber daily in 3 doses, which by itself had significantly lowered my LDL and total cholesterol prior to commencing Niaspan ER therapy. I've been exercising on an elliptical ski machine for 30 mins twice per day, burning  1000 calories, and have lost  50 lbs over the last six months.
271	ditropan	4	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	hyperhidrosis	The drug helped to decrease hyperhidrosis	Significant side effects - very dry mouth, sensation of burning when urinating, dry throat, dry eyes	The drug is not intended for hyperhisdrosis. However, it was prescribed for its side effects to help my hyperhidrosis. Whilst it was somewhat helpful, the side effects were very significant such as very dry mouth, throat, dry eyes, burning sensation when urinating.
11	nasonex	1	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	swollen passages from allergies	drug helped alleviate stuffy feeling without much notice of any side effects.	"in the past year i have been having reoccurring pink eye/blifuritis bouts.

1402	adipex-p	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	weight loss	I experienced a weight loss of approximately 3 kg in 1 month. The effects tapered off in the second month with the total weight loss to be estimated at 6 kg. Subsequently I felt less urge to snack	I experienced mood swings, short temper, thirst. I was constantly thirsty and had mild tension headaches too. Often, I will flare up for no good reason but the outbursts went away swiftly. I also observed that I am quite bloated after food.	I took the medication for 3 months, 3 times a week to prevent addiction. The treatment is optional with Mediaxal another weight loss drug which I opted out. I noticed an obvious decrease in appetite during the first 3 weeks with a gradual return of my appetite. I went back for a review every 2 weeks where my blood pressure and weight was recorded. The medicine was supplemented with a low calorie diet and exercise.
1950	lyrica	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	fibromyalgia	There was a minimum amount of pain reduction.  I believe the medication works neurologically and you do not realize you still have pain.  The side effects were so severe I was afraid to drive the car.  My memory and thought process was deeply distrubed and I still felt pain. My thought process changed so quickly during a mid sentence I sounded as if I was on drugs.  The side effects were just not worth tolerating for the small benefit.  I could not help but think with the way this is making me feel mentally what is the effect it is really having on me.  This medication was meant for Diabetics that suffer nerve pain.  I feel sorry for someone who would need to remain on this medication if it was helping reduce the pain.  As all medications it is not going to correct the underlying problem just address the symptoms associated with the problem.  I would not recommend anyone take it.	Irrational thinking, disrupted thought process, Slow reactions while operating a vehicle	Prescribe to me by my DO as the newest drug for Fibromyalgia she did not know how the drug worked but wanted to me to try it to see if it reduced my muscle pain.  I took myself off the drug because the side effects were to severe and they did not lesson over time.
3276	zoloft	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression	Patient experienced no treatment benefits.	The major side effect was persistent thoughts of suicide - always by hanging. These thoughts developed after about three weeks of treatment and became more persistent as time went on. Patient stopped taking the medication after two months subsequently informing attending physician, who initially did not believe that medication could provoke that side effect in someone 50 years of age.	Treatment details are as described above.
2337	propecia	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hair loss	Increased hair growth in the thinning areas on the head, making the hair look fuller. I also experienced less hair falling out.	Increased hair growth on shoulders, back, and chest. Decrease in my sex drive	1 mg pill taken daily for hair loss on the crown of the head. I later changed doctors and instead of prescribing Propecia he gave me Proscar 5mg, which i was able to take one-fourth of the tablet and save about $60.00 a month.
3854	azelex	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	acne	I was not able to use the cream long enough because of the side effects.	The cream itched and burned severely to the point of being nearly intolerable for the first week.  The burning subsided in the second week, but not to the point of being usable on a daily basis.	Application of cream nightly 15 minutes after washing.  Product information advised waiting, but it still burned and itched when applying it after waiting.  it had no real visible effect during the time I used it.  I gave it a 2 instead of 1 because I felt a very subjective glimmer of potential improvement at the end of the period, but not enough to overcome the pain.
2090	selegiline	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	increase dopmaine levels	increased synaptic dopamine levels. This gave me an amazing sense of wellbeing and clarity.	Positive side effects: see above	I'm a healthy 36 year old with no medical conditions. I use Selegiline (L-deprenyl) purely to optimise my health and fortunately use a loop hole to import the drug into the country which does not have restriction importation for personal use
676	zantac	5	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	ulcer	the benifits of the treatment were that it stopped the pain. i could sleep at night. i could eat food that i could not eat before. because i was not in consent pain i could get on with my life	there were not any treatment side affects except that you had to take two tablets twice a day for the rest of your life. this was not a cure. I THEN FOUND OUT THAT THER WAS AN AUSTRAILAN  DOCTER WHO FOUND THAT IN SOME CASES ULCERS WERE ONLY A BACTERIA AND A SIMPLE TEST WOULD FIND THAT OUT AND IF THAT WAS THE CASE A SHORT COUSE OF ANTIBOTICS AND AN ANTI ACID FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME WHISLT YOU WERE TALIKG THE COURSE OF ANTIBOTICS, WOULD GET RID OF THE PROBLEM, WHICH IN MY CASE IT DID. NOW I DONT HAVE TO TAKE DRUGS EVERY DAY!	tablet twice a day
1698	retin-a-micro	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acne	This cream was very beneficial for the treatment of acne and some blemishes.  I had many pimples around my mouth after getting waxied there and nothing was helping.  Further as soon as one pimple went away another formed.  This cream began to work within several days.  I could tell that the pimples were getting lighter and new pimples that were forming would hardly enlarge because I applied the cream as soon as I saw a new one forming, many of them disappeared without even leaving a blemish affterwards.	I had no side effects because I was applying the cream correctly; only before bedtime and washed them off in the morning.  However I heard of some other person whp took the same cream but was not aware of those instruction and instead applied it in the morning and  had her face exposed during the day.  The cream worked somewhat for her but the spots where she applied them stayed irritated and would turn red when the wind blew in her face.  This condition remained for several years afterwards for her.  THIS CREAM CANNOT BE EXPOSED TO THE SUN! Otherwise it works beautifully.	The treatment was very simple.  At night (and only at night!) I cleaned my face with a mild cleanser or atleast with water and did not apply any other medication before hand.  Afterwards I simply dabbed a very small, thin layer of the cream over the pimple and allowed the cream to dry and then went to sleep.  In the morning I made sure to wash off the cream before going outside.  For very sensitive skin the area may turn red but this is temporary and simply means that instead of applying each day one must use it every other day.
659	seasonique	2	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	birth control	I assume this birth control prevented pregnancy effectively. My boyfriend and I used it as a back up.	I've been on seasonique for three months now and they've been absolutely miserable. For starters, I'm 19 and NEVER have break outs. As soon as I started this pill, I began breaking out every few days. This pill has made me gain about ten pounds. I've been spotting for a month and a half. I have horrible cramps everyday. I'm EXTREMELY moody and emotional. I cry about absolutely nothing at all and snap at the smallest things. I get crazy hot flashes, I'll be freezing one minute and sweating the next. My back also hurts at times.	switched pills
3970	norvasc	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	Small pill easy to take.  Easy to pack in a travel pack in an alternate pill case without taking the entire bottle.	I did not experience any side effects that I am aware of.  Of course, I am concered over having high blood pressure which has to be directly related to work-related stress.	Apparently, this will be long-term treatment.  My doctor and I had several conversations over high blood pressure.  Though I have increased my exercise routines, there is not a positive impact on my blood pressure.  After 1 month on Norvasc, my blood pressure was within the normal range.
2822	wellbutrin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression; intrusive suicidal impulses	Within a couple of weeks, intrusive thoughts of suicide abated.  Over the next few weeks mood lifted some.  At the time I started I was desperate & hopeless was quite surprised it helped as much as it did without usual side ffects of anti depressants-sexual sidew effects & weight gain.  Didn't cure depression but definitely helped severe suicidality.  And I'm against anti-depressants as 1st run for treating mood disorders but there is a place for them when exercise, sprirtual practice, good nutrition & life balance not enough-but these life practices absolutely indispensible for any health issue esp. Mood disorders.	Does have light stimulant effect which is great for the extreme fatige of depression But/And any activating chemical can also increase hostile, angry feelings so tweek the dose for you so you don't get over reactive with others.	Take 300 mg wellbutrin xr daily in morning, eat healthy whole foods, exercise-outdoors as much as possible, prayer; meditation, yoga, get rest, restructure negative beliefs into positive beliefs-cognitive & spiritual approaches
2812	wellbutrin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	Wellbutrin and Prozac stabilized my moods and kept me from slipping into depression. There really wasn't anything more to it, but I gather I have to write 50 words, so here they are.	None.	I'm not sure I understand the question. This was pretty simple - I had a tendency to slip into deep depressions without medication. The drugs prevented that without side effects.
2497	remeron	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia	Remeron (mertazapine) was a god send for me. I had chronic insomnia with sleep deprivation for 12 years and tried to treat it with OTC drugs. It appeared one night, not slowly over time. I tried several meds without success before my doctor suggested Remeron. It took a few weeks to take effect but it has been 100% successful for about 17 years now. I used to take up to 45 mg. at bedtime but have ratcheted it down to 15 mg. over the years. If I miss one dose I know it. Falling asleep is no problem. My problem is staying asleep for more than 2 or 3 hours night after night after night. . . Not fun.	No side effects. No hangover. No morning drowsiness.	Take about 1/2 hour before bedtime.
2877	avita	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	A considerable decline in the occurrence of new spots accompanied treatment. The acne has been practically eliminated if a good cleansing routine is maintained. Red marks have faded. Blackheads have cleared up. The overall result is clearer and smoother skin.	Occasional mild skin irritation particularly in the beginning of treatment.	Applied a small amount to the face once daily in the afternoon. Applied sunscreen during the day to compensated for the increase in photosensitivity
704	accutane	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Eventual Acne reduction.	Dry skin and eyes, flaking skin and bloody noses. However, the most pertinent side effect was depression.	After struggling with acne throughout my teens, I was put on accutane with promises of a 'miracle drug.' My acne eventually cleared, but severe drug-induced 'flare-ups' of more acne were common, as well as feelings of depression.
3342	lipitor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	incontinence	regulated bladder control to allow patient (me) to return to a regular life and not have to modify all movements by where the nearest bathroon is located.	none	Single capsule taken in morning.
3571	differin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	my acne cleared up within a few months, and now it is gone.	You cannot wax your eyebrows! It thins your skin, so you can't wax.	I used the gel once at night. I also took an antibiotic and yazmin. I believe I will continue to use the differin even after I stop the antibiotic, just for it's benifits.
592	sulindac	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	baker's cysts behind both knees	"After about a week, I started to see a small reduction in the size of the fluid-filled cysts behind my knees.  Over the 3-week treatment period, there was about a 25 percent reduction in the size of the cysts. There was also a mild reduction in the pain associated with the cysts. 

Another benefit was that I did not get upper GI pain & bleeding with this med, whereas NSAIDs had been causing black stools due to GI irritation & bleeding."	Within about 30 minutes of taking each dose of Sulindac, I experienced a colicky pain under my ribs on the right side.  The pain was not extreme, but it was noticeable and unpleasant.  Duration lasted 2 - 4 hours each time.  This side effect persisted throughout the entire treatment period.	"Due to longstanding knee osteoarthritis, I am prone to fluid-filled cysts on the backside of my knees.  The cysts cause pain, swelling, and reduced circulation to the lower leg.  The cysts interfere with walking gait as well.

In past I had used NSAIDs to reduce the inflammation of these cysts, however due to NSAID-related side effects, this class of drug was put off-limits by my physician.  His recommendation was that I try a drug in the pro-NSAID class, which is less irritating to the stomach.

In retrospect, I think that for me, the Sulindac was a trade-off: less stomach irritation exchanged for liver irritation with the Sulindac.  Due to this side-effect, my doctor reduced frequency of medication to once per day.  My response to the Sulindac was less robust than I had hoped for -- much less improvement than I had experienced previously with NSAIDs -- and it also took a long time (3 weeks) to reach the level of improvement that in past I would achieve in 3 days with OTC NSAIDs."

But now because of side affects I only take it once a week or when needed.
200	adderall	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression, ptsd fatigue	Definitely noticed right away that I had more energy, better concentration and motivation, and could actually focus for the first time in years. By taking this med, it caused a chain reaction that got my life moving forward again: I started by becoming able to get out of bed and get things done around the house. Had more motivation to help myself in other ways - better nutrition, better exercise, self care, etc. Then my body and mind began to kick in and heal itself more. Now the med simply acts as a support for me, but I am ready to start tapering down my dose!!!	Had trouble losing too much weight at first. But that levels off after a while. Had problems sleeping when the dose was increased too quickly. I have to make sure I take the full amount for the day at least before 12 noon or I will have trouble sleeping that night. Sometimes I get shaky/nervous, dry mouth, feel dehydrated.	Take 2 pills about an hour before I wake up in the morning. Then I take the third pill between 11 am-12 noon.

Will not take pill again.  The side effects of loosing a nights sleep, having severe head pain, and feeling like throwing up will result in not taking another pill as this drug does not agree with patient.
3559	differin	2	Ineffective	No Side Effects	acne	Benefits were intended to be no facial acne	There were no side effects noticed	Was to be applied externally to the affected area every night at bedtime afer washing.
2106	renova	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne, wrinkles	I experienced a some evening of skin tone, somewhat smaller pores and very slight improvement in crowes feet	itchy skin, burning sensation on face, rash and scaling/peeling	"During the first 6 to 8 weeks, my skin became scaly, itchy and rashy. After 8 weeks my skin began to tolerate the cream a little better but it continued to itch and burn even after one year of use. I never used more then a pea size per the insturctions but the itching, dryness and rash never went away. It was very difficult to wear an type of makeup that didnt irritate my skin, while using this product. I made the mistake of using this product under my eyes, i learned later that this cream is not intended for use under eyes and due to the drying affect of this product, it did make the fine llines under my eyes appear worse.

I did not see any improvement of the acne on my cheek, and in fact, suffered worse acne while using Tretinoin."
1406	adipex-p	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	chronic fatigue syndrome	Improved ability to focus and concentrate. Memory retention better. Improved energy. Mainly helped relieve brain fog that is common with Chronic Fatigue/Fibromyalgia. Especially noticeable while working. Able to function better and work longer, more like my old self.	Weight loss, decreased appetite. If take too late in the day, may affect ability to sleep.	Take 1 pill in the morning to treat ADD-like symptoms that started after a car accident. Took several years to get Chronic Fatigue/Fibromyalgia diagnosis and quite awhile after that before this medicine was prescribed. Tried most of the standard ADD medications to help with brain fog but bad side effects, worked for awhile then stopped, or no effect. Many doctors not comfortable perscribing this medication for ADD or ADD-like symptoms since it's a weight-loss medicine. I usually only take this medication during the work week and give my body a break on teh weekends.
3632	retin-a	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	adult acne	It was fairly successful for the acne.  I found it especially good at spot treatment if I felt a cystic type coming up.	It did dry my skin out and there was peeling in some places, like the sides of my nose.  I had to be very careful about not getting it any where around my lips, because if I did I would quickly get a fever blister on my mouth. I don't know why this happened, but it was bothersome.	I applied it after cleansing skin at night and made sure my skin was completely dry before I put any on and I used a small amount, which was sometimes hard to spread around.
2828	singulair	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	chronic cough and allergies	singulair dramatically reduced coughing spells and allergy symptoms, but if just one treatment was missed the allergy symptoms reaccured.	none	Take one 20 mg tablet each night before bedtime.
2294	lexapro	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	The benefits were that once I started taking it, I became less emotional when I got upset.  I could handle the small things better than before, which used to set me off.  It evened out my moods so that I was less tempermental.	If I missed taking a dose, I would feel a bit lightheaded, dizzy or have a headache.  Too many missed doses lead to a really irritable mood.	After a break-up, I was very depressed and upset all the time.  I began taking a dose of 20mg and within a few days, noticed a difference.  I had fewer dramatic mood swings, and was able to handle the everyday things that got me upset in a more reasonable manner.  I did not feel like crying as frequently as before the medication, and I feel it helps me keep a pretty even temper.  I continue to take this medication because I have been told I have a natural chemical imbalance, and this keeps me from being overly emotional when it is unnecessary.  Overall, I feel I benefit from taking it, and unless I miss a dose, I have no side effects.
1204	prozac	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	There really weren't any - I didn't feel any better as the stressors in my life were still there.  I did not feel any relief from the depression, as a matter of fact, I felt worse.	I couldn't sleep at night and would fall asleep during the day.  It sometimes made me agitated too.	I really wasn't comfortable with taking Prozac in the first place - I had a crappy HMO doctor who thought giving me a pill would solve my problem.  I really just needed a change in my life (job, living in DC) to reverse my depression.  In other words, I think my depression was situational, not a chemical imbalance.  I know that these do work for many people, but I think it's imperative that a person know WHY they are depressed before they hit the pharmacy.
2486	mirtazapine	2	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	clinical depression	Did improve my appetite, which was suffering as a result of the depression.	Mild weight gain. Period of tiredness for two hours or so after each dose. Very hard to wake up in the mornings.	Was prescribed as an alternative to Citalopram. Had virtually no effect on my depression whatsoever. In the period of winding down the Citalopram dose then the 7 weeks on Mirtazapine I went from mildly depressed / just about coping to suicidal, unable to cope and deeply depressed most of the time. Would advise anyone who gets rapidly worsening depression after a med change to see the doctor again far sooner than I did.
946	dysport	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	wrinkles	I had deepening frown lines on my forehead and between my eyes....the benefits were a decrease of the lines (wrinkles).	"I had a mild headache for a couple of days after my injections.  Also, my forehead felt ""numb"" as if I had had a tooth pulled. Now, when I raise my eyebrows, my eyebrows go up and the middle of my forehead stays still.  It looks a bit strange."	I had 300 units of Dysport injected into my forehead in about 5 different places. I was told to not bend over or lie back for a few hours or touch my forehead after the treatment.  I followed my doctors instructions. It has been over a week since the injections and there is still a mild wrinkle between my eyes.  The wrinkle is definitely not as deep looking as it was but it is still visible. I would probably have this done again although the results are not perfect.
3806	cialis	5	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	ed	Long lasting erection	achy joints similar to flu symptoms during the next couple of days after taking. Not bad, but definitely annoying. Aspirin helps relieve, but I did not like having to take a pill to counteract another pill.  I do not have the same symptom with Viagra.	Taken as needed for ED.  It is effective in as little as 30 minutes.  Time depends if taken on empty stomach or after a meal.
3010	cipro	1	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	puncture wound	Cleared up the infection but any number of other drugs would have done just as well, without the awful side effects.	"Cipro can have a devastating effect on connective tissue.  In my case, loss of elasticity, leading to wrinkled, drying, aging  skin on face, neck, hands; suddenly visible veins; heightened sun sensitivity; easy bruising; weakened, painful knee and ankle joints, insomnia. I subsequently discovered that these are all too common ""rare"" side effects, among many others, and none of them emerged until a few days after finishing the dose.   Unless you have no other options, this is a medication to be avoided."	I subsequently discovered that I was prescribed this drug for a condition that any number of other drugs would have cleared up just as as easily and was given way too much of it as well.  The whole experience has been a nightmare.  Nearly a year later, still suffering after-effects.  Do not take this drug without checking it out. Cipro was black-boxed by the FDA less than a week after I finished my prescription, and MDs still hand it out like candy.
1189	prozac	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	"relief of depression, ""floor"" under worst moods, increased confidence, less sadness. Allowed patient to function normally in work and social situations"	Loss of libido, occasional fatigue. Jittery feeling when dosage was temporarily increased to 40mg	Was originally prescribed medication by psychiatrist, continued prescription from GP after cessation of psychiatric treatment
835	tarka	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypertension	very effectively reduced my blood pressure to a good level and has amitianed it for the 2+ years I have been taking it.	My lungs feel heavy at times and that produces a hacking cough. It's not all the time, just occasionally. It hasn't been bothersome enough to ask about changing it to something else yet.	"I'm taking one pill that contains two different blood pressure medications.
It has been very effective in controlling my hypertension."
215	lo-ovral	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne and contraception	Within days, the acne disappeared. When taken continuously for 3-5 months at a time, the acne never reappeared and the hirsutism decreased substantially.  We then added laser hair removal and stopped the spironolactone.	Spironolactone caused occasional leg cramping.  The Lo-ovral caused some water retention.	Spironolactone was taken 50 mg a day and then increased after 3 months to 100 mg twice a day.  The Lo-ovral was taken each day.  The laser hair removal was every 6 weeks.  The acne was completely under control.  When the OCP was stopped, the acne returned.
1846	yasmin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control, menstrual cramps	"the treatment benefits were reducing acne, helping me to have a more clear complexion.  Also it GREATLY reduced my cramps.  And, to this day, I am not pregnant :)  The benefits of this ""pill"" were far greater than any others I have tried, and I have tried several different brands."	The treatment side effects were minimal.  In fact I can't think of any.  I have tried many different types of the pill where it had side effects on my face, barely reduced cramps, however this one didn't have any of those side effects and I continue to use it.	it was one pill a day, as any birth control pill is usually taken.  I took them properly and that is probably one reason why the benefits were great.  However I took the other brands at the right time to and they didn't work as well.
392	hydrochlorothiazide	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypertension	Decreased blood pressure, decreased cardiac load, decreased kidney load	Increased urine output, potassium deficit	"Hydrochlorothiazide was prescribed by my doctor as a first line treatment of my mild hypertension (140/90).  In addition he recommended exercise, weight loss and dietary restriction of sodium.
This drug did lower my blood pressure to 130/90 which he thought was satisfactory for now."
27	alprazolam	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety, panic attck, nervousness	I experienced Xannax more effective for anxiety and panic attacks.	"I didn't feel any alarming side effects from this medication even after using for  over 8 years. 
The feeling of dependency doesn't bother as we are sometimes addict of certain foods also."	"First I experienced the state of anxiety and panic at the age of 20. Starting with Librium I was successful to managed and control my mood and over sensitive nature.
Regular exercise, food and lively hobbies helped to relieve me form all sedative and tranquilizers.
It was, probably, job related stress and tension what triggered the state of anxiety and panic.
Now the above-mentioned medications are helping to perform my activities, mostly as a normal person."
3612	retin-a	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	skin damage	Retin-a provided the benefits of reducing sun damage of the skin. It reduced some fine wrinkles and helped with uneven skin.	The side effects experienced were mainly red irritation and peeling. There was also an occasional bout of acne breakouts. The use also led to a couple of times when the skin felt like it had been burnt or had a sever sunburn.	Treatment was for sun damage to the skin. The retin-a was applied daily in the evening. It was advised not to use it durig the day since it could lead to excessive exposure of the sun.
756	flonase	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	significant supression of allergy symptoms with the exception of the eyes.	none	In a very allergenic location the previous week I had suffered very bad allergies, watery, itchy eyes, itchy face and inner ears, intense bouts of sneezing, running sinuses. With the combination of flonase and zyrtec the symptoms were eliminated with the exception of watery eyes.
2263	lexapro	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	peri-menopausal syptoms	I was experiencing a lot of hot flashes and I think they have subsided in frequency, duration and intensity since starting to take the Lexapro.

I wento off the Prempro for 3 months and the hot flashes came back, seemed worse than before. I am now back on and have taken 4 days, hot flashes are beginning to get better and hopefully will completely disappear soon!	none	Prempro is a wonder pill for hot flashes and I will never stop taking it again!
1458	cymbalta	5	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	chronic neck/back pain, chronic tension headache	Quickly helped with depression and nearly eliminated pain soon after starting.  Effects lasted for roughly four months.	Initially euphoria (lasted about three days), afterwards urinary hesitancy (stopped after about two months), dry mouth, mild fatigue, anorgasma.	"Started using Cymbalta 60mg to primarily for chronic tension headaches and neck/back pain and the resulting depression from chronic pain.  Worked wonderfully for about three months then slowly lost effectiveness.  Tried increasing to 90mg with little response.  Ended up switching antidepressants and finding different means to treat the pain.
It was a good drug when it worked, but unfortunately it didn't last very long.  It also acts on serotonin like an SSRI and started my dependency on SSRIs."
1898	doxycycline	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	rosacea	It did help with the red blotchy skin that the rosacea was causing and the heat that I would feel when the rosacea would kick in. It also helped with pimples and welts that would sometimes come on during a bought of the rosacea.	Side effects were it caused my skin to become extremely dried out. Used more moisturizer which did not seem to help. I also became very sensitive to the sun which was a problem because even if i used sunscreen I would become blotchy looking.	The Dr. had me take one 100mg pill 2 x a day. Said I would need to use for an indefinite amount of time. After 5 months I went off of them because I couldn't be outside much.
1911	avelox	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	bronchitis	I had taken avalox several times before because I had become immune to other antibiotics.  Avalox seemed to work previously.	I almost died.  I made it thru the first set of double doors at the emergency room and colapsed.  I believe that this triggered me to get Rheumatoid Arthritis five months later.	Chemo likely for the rest of my life.
913	paxil	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression	there was none.	he didnt get out of bed for three days,couldnt get him to eat (he only weighed 120 lbs),had to forse him to drink water, became even more depresses very suasidal,out of it,  and lethargic.

He was just a M.D., did not get a syc eval.
2138	concerta	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	adhd	I did not have any other conditions.  Just an inability to focus, hyperactivity, and impulsive behavior.  I had a hard time staying organized and difficulty completing tasks.  I also had difficulty staying with one job for too long.  I had a hard time sustaining reading without getting really tired, and I also had a hard time controlling my emotional outbursts.  The  Concerta really helped me control all of those things.	Some of the side affects that I had were:  my stomach would hurt sometimes and other times it was difficult to eat without getting queezy.  I didn't have much of an appetite.  When the medicine wore off, it seemed to have a strong rebound effect and things became difficult for me during that last several hours of my day. I liked taking the medication, I just wish it would have lasted longer during the day.  By 3p-5pm it had wore off and that seemed to by my busiest time of day with the kids, dinner and house stuff all at once.	The treatment details were pretty basic.  I just took the medication in the morning at the same time of day every day.  I was allowed to skip it on the weekends or less busy times if I so desired.  I really don't have anything else to put for this section of the survey.  I'm trying to fill up the 50 word requirement though.  You shouldn't really have that requirement on this form.  It seems kind of silly to be writing with nothing left to say.
2370	propecia	6	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	thinning hair	Hair loss all but stopped - kept crown area full.	Brain fog, difficulty calling up names, places, or specific details at times. Very annoying. Slight loss of libido, erections affected very, very slightly (takes a small amount more time to achieve full).	Started years ago when I saw hair falling out slowly. Worked extremely well, but saw more negative reviews over the years and felt more sluggish (in my mind) over time. Decided its not worth it, and am off it cold turkey as of 4 days ago. Feeling tired, and libido is lacking. Hoping I get back to my old self ASAP. I would not recommend this drug to anyone... hair is great, feeling 100% is WAY BETTER. Looking back? I'd leave it alone.
3284	zoloft	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	irritability,anxiety	instantly i felt relieved. i am able to stand back a bit from things that would previously really upset me. i am therefore able not to let things get to me,fantastic. so now i don't  explode instantly in anger at things anymore, i tried to think myself calm and non reactive previously but it did not work. with zoloft i have a calmness when meeting things that would normally make me enraged .i have time and mental space to be rational and realistic and can choose a sane quiet and dignified response, not aggression and anger. hallelujah.	i felt very nauseous. and dizzy. but these subsided after one month. till then i made sure i ate something with taking the tablet to minimize the discomfort.  it was a very very unpleasant sensation of nausea and a kind of vertigo, but the benefits outweighed the negatives. even though it was quite a strong feeling of sickness, very very strong. it has passed now though. thankfully. i considered stopping the zoloft because it was so bad, but if i went back to my old pattern of sadness and anxiety and arguing my husband may seriously have left me. so i persevered. glad i did too. cos the sickness has disapated.	i take 50 mg tablet. one a day in the morning with food.

Waited 20 minutes after application before applying sunscreen, moisturizer, or makeup.
1396	ortho-evra	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	birth control	This was a the easiest birth control that I have ever used, I like the idea of worring about it only once a week	Two months after I started the patch I began to have really dark colored urine. I assumed that this was a side affect to the patch. I went to my doctor who saud that is was not related, but now it has been 3 years since I stopped the patch, and now have kidney disease. Maybe just coincidence, But in my heart I feel it was the patch.	1 PATCH CHANGED WEEKLY
2820	wellbutrin	3	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Did not take it long enough for any noticeable benefit.	My hair started falling out after the first week. During  week two, I saw my doctor and told her about this. She said it was not a known side effect. Internet research assured me the hair loss was not coincidental; others had the same reaction. I quit taking it a few days later.	"300mg Wellbutrin daily.

2832	singulair	2	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	allergies	Singulair seemed to work well at controlling my allergies. I the beginning I didn't notice any side effects.	After use Singulair I began developing pretty strong depression side effects including thoughts of suicide. At first I didn't realize that these thoughts and feelings of depression were connected to Singulair. After hearing about possible side effects on the News I stopped taking Singular, whiched ended the severe depression.	In the begining Singulair seem to work well controlling my allergies, however I slowly developed strong depression side effects. I've never had problems with depression before. The effects of the drug were slow and hard to notice any day to day change. However all depression side effects ended immediately when I quit taking Singulair. I'll never take this drug again.
2565	klonopin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety and depression	The drug has a very long half life and because of that property there is a long, smooth sustained effect of the drug. I did not feel highs or lows and hardly knew I was taking it except it helped my anxiety.	occasional dry mouth	I could not take any anti-depressant medications. I tried them all but had terrible side effects. My doctor is extremely good with medication therapy for depression and anxiety and decided I have a serotonin sensitivity and so put me on this drug which works on a different endorphin pathway called gabba. I have had terrific success on it and although it too has addictive properties like other Diazapenes, I have not had to increase my dose at all therefore he doesn't think true physiological dependence is developing.

132	valtrex	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	genital herpes	The sores became much less painful very soon, on the 2nd day. Overall, the healing was much faster, and there were only two pills a day to take (not 2 x 3 times a day, like with old-times Acyclovir), which was convenient	As I have a chronic gastritis, my stomach rarely agrees with oral treatments, so I felt minor irritation, a bit of heartburn, but nothing serious	"I had had herpes for years before I was prescribed Valtrex (previous treatments were Acyclovir). It was prescribed on the second day after the sores appeared and I noticed the improvement the next day - the pain was almost gone. I took two pills per day, one in the morning and one in the evening, for 7 days, after which the remission was longer than the previous ones (sometimes, the outbreaks happened as often as every two weeks), about two months. 
After that, I started taking 2 pills of Valtrex the day I started feeling the outbreak (a nasty, gnawing feeling in the area where the sores would appear) and if it does not prevent the outbreak entirely, it lasts much shorter, is much less painful, and each time the remissions are rather long."
283	xyrem	9	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	narcolepsy, fibromyalgia	Woke up feeling a little less like a zombie, No more insomia.	Out of sorts, falling if I get up when medication has taken affect.	I take this medication for severe narcolepsy. It has helped with the feeling of not sleeping at all when I would wake up the next morning. However, if you do not get into bed and STAY for about 3 hours you can fall and do things you don't even realize you are doing. I got up to use the bathroom a few times on this medication and once I fell into the bathtub and also have fallen asleep on toilet if I have gotten up to use the bathroom. It can take affect VERY quickly if you have an empty stomach. There was a time I thought I had at least 15 minutes before it put me to sleep but I hadn't eaten much and it kicked in in 5 minutes. I fell asleep talking to my Fiance. It literally knocks you out like when you are put under anesthesia for surgery. It can be very dangerous but it is quite affective for helping you sleep and go into the refreshing cycles of sleep.

1677	claritin	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	cold	Dr recomended this for a cold.

I noticed colours for the first time in years and I couldn't stop looking at the beautiful sky, grass and flowers. I felt alive, energetic, happy and positive, For the first time in years I wanted to get up in the mornings and LIVE. I wanted to go out in the world again, where as before I hid in my house because of panic attacks. I landscaped my whole garden and when that was done, I decided I wanted to work again and found a job. My marriage flourished after this new me and I fell pregnant 6 months later, at which time I had to discontinue, but that 6 months of Prozac was all it took to give me a new life.

Loss of appetite (a GOOD side affect in my books! I lost quite a few kgs and it did wonders for my self esteem).

3111	ortho-tri-cyclen	3	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	birth control	Prevented pregnancy, completely cleared up my (moderate) acne.	Taking Ortho TRI-Cyclen had a dramatic impact on my moods.  I felt slow, distant, and complacent.  I felt like a dumbed-down, watered-down version of myself.  The physical effects were also disturbing: I developed a dark brown discharge and grew black hairs around my nipples.  But the most extreme side effects actually occurred when I went OFF the pill, which I had to attempt twice before I could get through it: I experienced the most severe depression of my life, several week-long, heavy periods, hair loss, and very bad acne.	Typical: 1 pill per day.

2917	tramadol	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	ankle sprain	I was able to walk (although I should not have)and drive in total comfort. All the pain was aleviated throughout the period of time i was taking the tablets. I felt in full control of all of my senses, even though i was a little more relaxed than normal.	There was a definate difference in bowel motions. I simply did not go during the three days of taking the tablets. I feel that if i had, had to continue the medication for any length of time then i would have been most uncomfortable. I would have had to resort to some sort of laxative treatment.	After badly twisting my ankle I took the pain killer Tramadol . Although I was advised to take one tablet , three times per day. I did actually only take two tablets during the day. I felt the results were more than enough.They worked well enough and long enough to last me for a longer period of time.
413	imitrex	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine headaches	"Within 30 minutes for injections to 2 hours for caplets I was pain free and functional.

I had gone camping and run out of Imitrex.  I was in pain for about 14 hours when I was taken to a little emergency clinic. They gave me an injection of 50 miligrams and in about 15 minutes I was pain free and feeling normal."	Sometimes a little queasiness if taken on an empty stomach.  Sometimes a little fatigue and a feeling of slight slowness.	"My insurance only covers 9 pills every 28 days, so my physician prescribes 100 miligram caplets and I cut them in half to give more dosages.  The caplets work well if the migraine is caught early. I most often wake up with the migraine starting and will take my pill and lie back down with a cold cloth or ice pack for 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on how advanced the pain is. 

If I catch it really early the pain stops progressing and I feel well with in 30 minutes to an hour.

If the maigraine has progressed too far the caplets don't work and I use a self injection of the 50 miligram dosage which works within 30 to 60 minutes without much side effect.

If I take the Imitrex by mistake for a headache that is not a migraine I get queasy and tight in the stomach and feel hung over."
2491	remeron	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety, depression, panic attacks	Felt 'normal' rather than in a state of panic and anxiety. Thoughts were clearer and not racing. Felt calm and peaceful.	I was told patients can gain weight on it - i didn't. (apparently you eat more, that's where the extra weight comes from)....can make you tired, which for me is good, as i'm very hyperactive.	After trying many anti-depressants, anti-anxiety and panic drugs - sometimes alone, sometimes in combination, nothing really worked for years until i tried (and continue to use) Remeron. It has made a *world* of difference to me and my quality of life. Started out on 7.5 mg one per day - gradually increased it. Too much made me sleepy, but found a right balance. Wish i knew about the drug many many years ago.
2980	strattera	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	adult add	calming effect, helped with sleep, helped with concentration, reduced appetite, improved depressive symptoms	nausea at first, agitation at first, sleeplessness initially. it seemed to take away my sense of urgency for things a bit, which was good for alleviating anxiety but might have caused difficulties with timeliness at work and time management overall.	Long history of ADD symptoms eventually diagnosed at age 37. had to stop taking medicine because i left job and health insurance lapsed. this medicine was far more effective for me than adderal, which caused me to be very emotionally labile and sensitive, and caused dramatic blood sugar drops. i really wish i could go back on strattera, it really felt right for me.
1033	vyvanse	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	adult adhd	After taking Adderall XR for about a year, my doctor switched me to Vyvanse.  Vyvanse not only helps me focus and take away the symptoms of ADHD that I was experiencing, but it does so for about 12 hours.  With Adderall XR, the effects lasted only a few hours, and I experienced a crash after the effects wore off and I instantly because extremely cranky and irratable.  With Adderall XR, I also lost the desire to eat.  I am hungry with Vyvanse, and do have the desire to eat.  With Vyvanse, I do not feel the crash at the end of the day, and I do not experience any moodiness.  I am very please with this drug, and it has changed my life for the better.  I have reccommended it to other family members with the same problems that I have and they have shared with me similar success stories.	The only side effect I experience is times of having a slightly dry mouth.  The dry mouth I experienced with Adderall was much worse.	I take one 70mg pill a day in the morning. I don't take it with food and it does not bother my stomach at all.
599	risperdal	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety	In the case of a panic attack, this would soothe the anxiety and calm me down-a numbing sensation--a highly effective anti-psychotic in several situations--kept a low-level feeling of calmness and barrier to anxiety/stress	Unfortunately, weight gain was a marked side effect, and led me to take a lower dose--also in high doses, I almost felt like a zombie--totally numb and emotionless--a disturbing concept.	Prescribed by my psychiatrist to use in various doses over several years of use to use for anxiety and panic, and in conjunction with Klonopin as an effective measure to reduce a mixed/manic episode of bipolar disorder in an acute situation, and also at a low-level dose every day to reduce the chance of episodes from occuring. Good tool in anger management as well.

3343	lipitor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	elevated cholesterol	lowered lipid levesl	none	none
1067	botox	5	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	for wrinkle (line) reduction	Botox was administered to help reduce the lines appearing on my forehead and at the outer side of my eyes- crows feet.  The 100 and 50 unit injections were effective in reducing the lines for a period of about 5 months, but there were noticeable adverse reactions with the 100 units.  The 50 units were as effective but without the spasms noted under Treatment Details.  OF the 2 times 50 units were injected,  the last time the botox had been reconstituted for more than the recommended 4 hours.  There was concern of effectiveness, but actually it seems as though the botox was more quickly effective, and seemed more effective in reducing the lines that the previous 50 unit injection.  More detail is covered under the treatment details.	Side effects were twitching of eyes, especially upon smiling,,, spasms of cheeks.  Blurry vision.  This lasted for approximately 3 days.	"The first use of botox was 100 units. Injections were 5 injections on the upper-mid forehead. 3 injections were given around the outer side of each eye. Within 2 hours it was difficult to close my eyes.  The forehead was totally stiff. Upon smiling and talking my cheek muscles were noticably twitching.  Eye lids twitched, friends noticed my face spasming.
   I make note of this issue because of the fact concerning the stability of the botox.  I realize that botox is available in 50 or 100 unit vials, which are then reconstituted. The nurse stated that he had to use all of the botox (apparently he only had the 100unit vial)because it would be instable after 4 hours.    
   Since this time, I have had 50units of botox at two different times, injected in the same areas stated above.  There was no adverse spasms, be definite ""freezing"" of the forehead muscles.  The 100 units and 50 units lasted about 4-5 months before lines started to appear again due to frowning, smiling, etc.   I recently had only 10 units injected mid-upper forehead in 2-3 injections. Upon raising my eyebrows I needed (I thought) injections more lower mid section since the upper forehead did not move.  After one month, I find that I have a few lines above my eyebrow but in general, my forehead is less lined.
  My MAIN CONCERN is :  if physicians, agents  have only 50 - 100unit vials available, and they are only injecting 1 client, what do they do with the residual.  Is this why there is such a high cost  $11 - $15 per unit??  It makes me wonder if physicians are freezing or using the botox beyond the 4 hour expiration time.  Have manufacturers ever thought of packaging smaller unit packages to assure clients are getting ""the real"" stuff.  This last physician did not have the manufacturer's bottle for me to see, only a small syringe already pre-filled."
1459	cymbalta	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	chronic back pain/depression/anxiety	"Hello all !
Through the past two years I was diagnosed with Shuermann's Kyphosis, a degenerative back disease in the lower spinal column. Throughout the past two years I have been on and off intensive narcotic pain killers, Ie. Vicodin ES,Percocet,MS Contin etc.. I knew enough was enough, so like that I stopped taking them. I have no side effects whatsoever. I have been through and still ongoing physical therapy ( 4th session 1 session is 3 weeks ) and been too four Orthopedic doctors and spinal specialists. My doctor and I discussed a long term pain application to get me off taking narcotics. I am no pro, but I know that opiates are the best for bad chronic pain, which i experience every day in my life. My doctor and I talked about Cymbalta which can be used to tone down the pain level sensors in the brain so I am not experiencing so much pain. I also have high levels of depression, and anxiety. Recently my Aunt and Uncle passed away which they practically raised me when I was born in Ireland, and my Sister's deaths was even more of a add on. I felt myself slipping into a deep black hole, and was looking for cheap thrills just to keep myself from going crazy ( literally ). Anyways, it has been my third day on this prescription, and I feel like a new person. I find myself enjoying simplistic things, and taking initiative in my life to pursue my goals and education. I am currently unemployed and as a young adult it is very hard to maintain money flow with no job. I am enrolled and taking college courses which I have 2 more semesters left before I receive my degree. In one of my classes (Chemistry) We are assigned a Science experiment. Mine, will be for depression and pain levels which will I am using Cymbalta. I recorded myself for two weeks, and then the first day after each dose of the drug. I am feeling alive, and that classical person everyone enjoys being around. I have read a lot about this drug and how it fails or makes situations worse. But for me it is working, and I am consistent in my daily routine. I shall continue to document all of my feelings and side effects from this prescription."	I have no side effects at the moments. This drug is being used for a dual purpose action as stated in my recordings. I feel that this has a mixed review. For me I was given two weeks of trials, and then 10 refills. So my advice to any of you, is to ask your care giver for a sample of any drug you take before you make it a routine pill. It takes 3-6 weeks for a Human to become physically and mentally dependant. I am very pleased overall otherwise.	1 pill (30mg) Per day, in the morning.
3022	cipro	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	skin infection	None. The Cipro appeared not to work for my skin infection.	Extreme swelling of the lips.	I was approximately 44 years old. When fertilizing my garden, the wind kicked up and blew the fertilizer all over me. After washing it off, the skin on my midsection (around the stomach area) began to itch and turn red. Shortly afterwards, blisters appeared and the skin began to be infected. My doctor prescribed Cipro, which not only did not work but caused my lips to be extremely swollen, so swollen that the skin on my lips split in a few places and bled. I could actually easily see my swollen lips by simply casting my eyes downward. I stopped taking the Cipro and reported the condition to my doctor, who was at a loss to explain why the Cipro did not help my skin infection.

657	seasonique	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	have not stop bleeding	None	Bleeding not even Spotting	"Ladies: I am sure you may have done lots of researches by now regarding taking Seasonique (PLEASE do before you try to take this drug), and there are lots of negative than positive comments on this drug. I would like to point out a couple of my comments to share with you. I normally have 4 - 5 days menstrual periods every month. But I was not happy and tried to be on this drug because it described 4 periods only per year (WOW! what a great idea, especially I have small child, school, work, and husband). Guess what happen since then? I have been bleeding almost 2 weeks now, and from light to heavy, the worst part is I get all these uncomfortable cramps, keep waking up at night, my personalities change from good to bad, I have not been in a good mood since then. of course not, how can I be in a good mood when my vagina keeps bleeding on me every single day (I am sure no woman likes that), and so on. I spoke with my OB, and she said it's normal. I don't think so, it is completely not normal to me. I have been bleeding, and ruin my daily life style. No wonder it is called Birth Control. How can you have sex with your partner while you have all these symtomps in your body especially bleeding? I stop this drug, and can't wait to have my clean dates back.

Ladies: I am not saying all the women's body are the same. But if you want to be on this drug. I would advise you do more researches and read more comments before trying, and other advise is if you think it's a good idea for 4 periods per year, you may want to think twice. Because it's a mother nature for women that has 13 menstrual periods every year, trying to change it and playing with your hormones are the game, unless you like to gamble, then you may want to try this excitment drug, and hope you will win. Otherwise, please consider something else. I am so regret that I did not read all the comments and reviews before I asked my OB to put me on this drug. Therefore, I have to suffer what I deserve (I guess). I just don't want to see another woman to be suffered like me, as I finally found out there are lots of women out there are taking the same drug (before I made up my mind to throw this drug away) that are suffering the same symtomps but still want to continue and hopefully that will work one day. For me, ""no is no"". You can call me chicken or looser or whatsoever. But let me tell you, it is defintely not fun if the drug makes your life changes from okay to worse!

Final words...... Good luck if you are on this prescription, and I hope you win, if not, you defintely need these words ""Good Luck""! :)"
2437	wellbutrin-sr	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I began to notice the positive benefits within a few weeks.  My mood brightened, I stopped feeling grief and self-loathing, began to remember what I liked to do. I also had increased ability to concentrate, increased energy, increased sex drive.   I was no longer depressed.  I stopped taking the medication after a couple of years, and the symptoms of depression did not return.	I actually felt pretty upset during the first couple of weeks - shaky, a little manic and sensitive.  That did go away, though.  I also had occasional insomnia throughout.	I met with my physician four weeks after I began taking the medication, then 3 months later, then every six months. I did not attend talk therapy or receive any other treatment.
1477	cymbalta	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	"It itnitially helped a great deal. The first 2 days I slept and I felt really good for a change. My aches and pains seemed to vanish. I had energy and felt motivated. My ""quick to aggravate"" temperment diminished as well."	The first 2 days on it I slept. Then by the fourth to fifth month, I started to experience heart palpitations at an increasing rate daily. I was weaned off and restarted 6 or so months later and once again, by the 4-5 month range, the palpitations started to increase again. During the first round, I had a dimished appetite and lost 15 lbs. During the second round, it didn't seem to affect my appetite either way.	I was started on 30 mg po qd for 2 weeks then increased to 60 mg po qd.
2276	lexapro	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	helped anxiety & black moods, headaches.  Made my life a happier place to be in, especially for my family.  Have had great results with lexapro with only minimal side effects such as a small weight gain.	Would not recommend going off lexapro cold turkey as the effects of doing this are pretty horrible such as head spins, highly recommend slowly weaning yourself off it.  Have had a slight weight gain due to slowing me down considerably.	Doctor prescribed lexapro when I had seen him about black moods & depression which is something I have had on and off since I was very young.   Depression was starting to effect my family life so felt I needed to see a doctor, he prescribed me lexapro as it helps with depression & anxiety.  I was prescribed 10mg and take one tablet daily.  I visit the doctor regularly to update progress on lexapro
3326	tetracycline	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	My rosacia and acne were improved 60% by the drug but I believe that the Murad Skin Care line for acne helped more than the drug.  I used both daily, first the drug for 3 mo. then the Murad for 3 mo.  The Murad appeared to help more without any negative side effects. My skin on the drug was very sensitive to sunlight but not with the Murad treatment.	I did get a yeast infection with the drug and increased sensitivity to sunlight.  I did not get either negative side effects with the Murad skin care treatment line.	I was to use the drug daily for a period of 3 mo.
1723	trimethoprim	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	bladder infections	The drug was to prevent further infections which were starting to scar the kidneys. After taking the drug my daughter did not have any more infections. it was a low level dose and did not seem to affect her in any way e.g causing digestive problems.	There were none	I  5ml spoon was to be taken in the morning and evening
2785	keppra	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	for epilepsy	We aren't sure.  We wonder if it is really controlling the seizures at all.  We are hoping our daughter can get testing to determine if her seizures are catamenial in nature.  She was on carbatrol with complete control, but was switched to Keppra due to her upcoming marriage (much lower risk of birth defects and ability to use birth control pills while on it).  She was completely weaned off of Carbatrol at one point and went almost 8 weeks with no seizure activity.  She also went 5-1/2 months with no seizure activity with Keppra before having a tonic clonic seizure.  Due to her history of seizures (started at the age of 14 a couple of months after she started her period), and the ability to go for long periods of time without problems, we wonder if she is having extreme spikes in estrogen when she ovulates from time to time. We hope that our neurologist will work with an endocrinologist and gynocologist to see if there is some validity to our theory.  The goal is to get her back under complete control.	The main side effect we noticed with Keppra was weight loss.  She dropped 20 lbs. in less than a month.  She had a very suppressed appetite for the first 6 or 7 months.  She has since gained back maybe 5 lbs. but continues to have a suppressed appetite just not as much as at first.	She takes 3 pills in the morning upon waking and 2 pills at night before going to bed.  She was taking 1 Klonopin pill but is now taking Lamictal and is gradually increasing the dosage.  Her neurologist is weaning her off of Keppra and gradually moving her to Lamictal.
3277	zoloft	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety/panic attacks	made my daughter less anxious	made my daughter numb to normal social skill development	My daughter began having school/social anxiety when she was about 9.  She is dyslexic too.  She was put on Zoloft to help control her anxiety and panic attacks.  I think it helped, however she became numb to a lot of social norms.  She never did anything terrible, but I always felt that she would do something inappropriate.  We d/c her Zoloft at the beginning of the summer of 2007.  We weaned her off per the dr's instructions.  She is much more normal now.  Minor anxiety and a lot more normal as far as social skills and obeying social norms.
2985	strattera	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	add	Greater focus, stronger commitment, lessened stress, improved self-confidence, goal setting, less depressed, better organization and memory (as in remembering events), clearer in thought and expression thereof.	Lower regard for self-value, naturally depressive concepts seem less far-fetched, appear less happy.	"With or without this medication I am a philosopher. So I will be explain how the drug works on me from a philosophical assessment.

Background:
I had taken Strattera for three years (2005-2007) where it helped control ADD where I had difficulty doing so. It helped me focus, stay organized, manage relations, and most or all of the benefits I listed prior. I dropped the drug for 3 years so that I may learn how to control my ADD without the help of medication. During those three years I gained remarkable self control in overcoming ADD. However, I got to the point where I couldn't win over ADD, which was losing focus randomly. During college lectures that I found very intriguing I would often zone out/space out when I could not have been more interested in what was being professed. The frustration of this led me to conclude that medical assistance was the best choice.

On the drug:
I read and understand that the (generally) biggest con--side effect--to this drug is that there is some sort of depressive or suicidal figure involved. From an evaluative standpoint of myself, I've concluded that my desire for happiness is lowered from where it was prior to the drug. In other words, if I felt a need for a happiness at a 9th strength before, I now had the need for happiness at a 5th strength. Since happiness, to me and most I'd say, is the driving force for existence in life, a lessened desire for it would lead to two results. Lessened feeling for the needing to exist/live and feeling less depressed (because I now do not need to be happy as much as before).

Understand that this drug does not control me, I control this drug. I suggest that while you take the medication you assert a greater self-awareness. As you examine how it affects you, you can understand when you are thinking naturally or by the drug."
2547	baraclude	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hepatitis b	The viral load count was reduced from millions to less than a hundred within 9 months. Though the virus cannot be completely removed, reduction in number helped my physiological health in addition to the physical.

Viral load check every 3 months together with ALT, AST and complete blood count.
671	zantac	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hives	Extreme urticaria (hives) on forearms and mild (hives) on face and legs were near completely cured with the Zantac.	No side effects that I remember	I had horrible rashes on my forearms, the right one especially, that were extremely itchy. I tried topical anti-itch creams and put ice on it to soothe the itching but nothing relieved my symptoms more than slightly. I thought it would eventually go away by itself. After suffering for 4 or 5 weeks I went to my doctor. He took 1 look at my arms and said I had hives. Probably due to seasonal allergies. He wrote a prescription for Zantac and sent me on my way. Within the 1st day of taking the medication my hives were less than half than they'd been. Within a week they were nearly gone.
3981	amitiza	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	ibs	My stomach aches went away. I wasn't as nauseated as I would have been without anything.	I have been getting headaches sporadically and the doctor said this is a possbile side effect. Also, I was very nauseated the first 2 weeks, which they say happens in 30% of the population taking this drug, but then it subsided.	I am taking this medication after being diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome. I was on Zelnorm for this and it was like a miracle drug!! It fixed all my problems for months, then it went off the market. The doctor then told me to try this as an option. It definately helps more than not taking anything at all and I can tell when I get these stomach pains that I forgot to take the drug.
882	paxil	7	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression	Significantly decreased depression and anxiety. More effective than Lexapro which was also taken prior by patient. Definitely a more effective product.	None which was an improvement from Lexapro which caused insomnia and fatigue. Did not experience any significant side effects.

Hairloss is a rare side affect, but it seems to affect a lot of women.
2375	eulexin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acne	Completely cleared resistant adult cystic acne that had not responded to any topical meds or to Accutane.	None. I had regular blood tests to check liver function, but had no negative reactions of any type.	Fifteen years of dermatologists, peels, topicals, Accutane, and nothing had cleared my cystic acne and constant breakouts, though a few treatments lessened the severity. Flutamide 125mg b.i.d. took one month to take effect, and within 6 weeks completely cleared ongoing resistant acne that had lasted more than 20 years and was worsening in my late 30s. AFter one year, we tried weaning off the drug. The results lasted for about 5 months, before the acne gradually returned. Went back on flutamide, and a month later the acne had left. We are now trying to see if a lesser maintenance dose is possible.
1262	provigil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	primary hypersomnia	Increased alertness  throughout the day with increased sleep quality. I still have to take naps in my car on some days, but overall this medicine is working great for me.	There have been no side effects to date, and have been on the medication for 2 years	Diagnosed through sleep study with primary hypersomnia; sleep Dr. suggested Provigil instead of Ritalin. Has worked wonderfully.

1713	retin-a-micro	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	acne	None at all; my acne went from mild to severe. I woke up everyday with big new, painful whiteheads. Each time a group of pimples went away, several new ones formed immediately. I also have oily skin, and I read that Retin-A rapidly reduces oil; my skin is just as oily as the day I started and my acne is as bad as when I was a teenager.	My skin has been extremely red the entire time I've taken this medication. It is so drying that even my ears and lips are persistently dry. I need to wear chap stick all day, everyday just to keep my lips from peeling. The area where I most use the cream has also been extremely dry and flaky.	I applied it every night before bedtime.

I did not get a heart infection.	I developed shortness of breath and itching all over my body. I had to go to E.R.  There  was also a slight skin redness.	I took the Keflex one hour before my dental appointment. I got my teeth cleaned.  On my way home, I started itching all over my body and developed  a slight rash with reddening.  I also felt like I could not breathe or get enough oxygen. So instead of going home, I went to E.R.  They gave me an injection (I don't remember the name) and told me to use Benadryl at home for a couple days.  If it got worse, the doctor said to return to E.R.

Pt continues on the regimen today (has been for years 5+)
2514	motrin	8	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	sprained ankle	The Ibuprofen helped relieve pain and swelling from the sprained ankle. It lowered the amount of time it took to heal the ankle and also provided lasting relief from discomfort caused by swelling and pain. Swelling was substantially lowered after a week period and steps were taken to allow the ankle to regain flexibility due to subsiding of pain.	There were no treatment side effects except for occasional nausea or drowsiness. Drowsiness however helped the patient sleep faster and thus avoid discomfort of laying in bed with a sprained ankle. Overall it simply lowered the amount of time it took to heal the ankle and also provided lasting relief from discomfort caused by swelling and pain.	Three two-hundred milligram tablets of Ibuprofen were taken for two weeks daily. The sprained-ankle caused substantial pain, discomfort and swelling. In order to begin the healing process and rehabilitation of the ankle's flexibility, Ibuprofen was taken.

Side-effects were low and insignificant though there might be effects if taken in the long term.
2086	accupril	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hypertension	lower blood pressure in combination with Hyzaar	None I am aware of.	Taken once daily in combination with Hyzaar.

I had a stricture that was causing my pain, but severe bathroom visits.  The stricture was fixed with surgery.  The frequency of the bathroom visits is lessend with Remicade.  It helps within 1 to 1 1/2 weeks.  The only bad thing is that I find myself needing it desparately at 7 weeks.  I suffer for 2 weeks then until I can get it and let it start working again.	No side effects for me.	It takes 10 minutes to get registered.  Another 30 minutes to get my IV started and my medicine ordered and brought up.  Then it takes about 2 1/2 hours to infuse.
3770	plavix	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	after an angiogram	Prevention of blood clot formation after angiogram. The angiogram was required as the patient (myself) has a calcium score of about 4000 (extremely high) and had  complained of minor episodes of intermittent weakness in the hands and feet. The angiogram revealed a number of partial arterial blockages being treated first with Lipitor and currently with Crestor, niacin and aspirin.	Mino9r bleeding from the surfacen of the skin in a couple of occasions, minor bruising also in a couple of occassions.

3056	seroquel	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	severe insomnia	Seroquel knocks you out, but for me it takes about 2 hours to start working. I take it about 2.5 hours before I actually want to get to sleep, and it lulls me into a very deep sleep. I rarely remember dreams. Seroquel has an amazing ability to erase memories of the day before, which for me is usually a good thing. Highly recommended for people with severe insomnia and/or rapid mood swings.	Weight gain and some grogginess in the morning. I am no longer a size 10, but I'm okay with it because sleep keeps me sane.	I take one 100mg tablet about 2 hours before I go to bed (I have a slow metabolism).  I allow about 30 minutes in the morning to wake up and be functional before I leave for work or school. I usually hit the snooze button about 3 times.
842	ritalin	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	adhd	Primarily, my son was much better able to focus, control his impulsivity and, as a result, did better in school.  Our house became a much more peaceful place once he was better able to control his temper, which largely came from his frustration in knowing he was not doing as well as he could.	Initially, he experienced some sleepiness, but he adjusted to the medication and no longer has this problem.	"We were initially reluctant to treat an otherwise healthy boy for what some describe as ""boy"" behavior, but he was increasingly frustrated with his inability to get along with siblings and classmates.  However, seeing now how much it has helped him - without making him into a different person -- we're glad we did."

I felt less inhibition in my spending and bought more products than I had in the past.	Was put on paxil which was quite effective but had the side effect of wt gain. Switched to lexapro.

Ease of use over creams, etc.	none	"1 pill every morning at least one hour before eating.  Topical medications were a hassle to use consistently, were seldom ""cosmetically elegant"", and did very little to keep symptoms from escalating.  Dermatologist prescribed Oracea when it became obvious the the topicals were never going to control the pustules.  Oracea cleared it up in a couple of weeks and gave consistent results throughout treatment - Rosacea was practically forgotten about - with no side effects.  Several months after discontinuing use, pustles have returned but are nothing like before treatment and are manageable with OTC topicals.  Expensive but Oracea does offer discounts worth looking into."
2306	lexapro	6	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	depression	The treatment benefits were marginal at best.  Mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases.	On the plus side, I experienced no major side effects.  The possible effects can range from nausea to sexual dysfunction, but none were a problem.  However, it is possible to feel a sort of withdrawal.	The pills are administered once a day, daily, for as long as you think it's worth taking them.  The prescribing physician recommended taking Lexapro for at least six months to get the full benefit of its normalizing effects.
3602	retin-a	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	My acne has completely dminished...i have the occasional break-out, but on a an everyday consistent basis i am now acne-free due to Retin-A!  It helps to take a break while using it because your skin will become used to it, however after a few weeks off, the effects are just as wondederful to your skin as when you first began.	Peeling, dryness, sun sensitivity	I applied a small amount of Retin-A every evening before bed and washed if off in the morning.  If you are able to get through the initial stage which includes the side effects  (peeling, dry skin, redness, irritation, and sun sensitivity) your skin will emerge better looking and healthier in the end.
3008	cipro	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	serious food poisoning, uti	"I landed in a West African hospital with my insides coming out and suffering from the worst stomach pain as a result of (probably) eating bad food. I vomited for 12 hours until I got the drip and then I was okay for the next couple days in the hospital (although the stomach pains remained).

Cipro is also the god of beating Urinary tract infections: I've taken both a 3 and 5 day course, and its been effective instantly."	I had no side effects.	For UTI, take one every 12 hours for prescribed number of days. (And finish the whole course!)
107	celebrex	3	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	knee pain	I did not experience any benefits after one week of usage.  I chose to discontinue the treatment.	Some mild stomach irritation.	The knee pain became progressively more severe over the course of 2-3 months. My family doctor sent me to physical therapist who stress tested the knee, and the physical therapist determined that I should see the specialist.  A consultation with an orthopedic doctor was scheduled with an MRI performed.  The MRI showed some swelling in the knee joint ligaments under the front of the knee cap.  No tears or spurs were visible, thus the diagnosis was possible early stage of arthritis and/or minor injury.  I felt the arthritis was not completely impossible but more likely that some possible injury was probable owing to my daily work activity but no exact injury could be documented.  After the week of celebrex usage, without any noticable relief, I chose to discontinue the medication route in favor of some time off (2 weeks) with ice-pack heat-pad therapy to reduce swelling and pain. Next I self applied sparingly over time some physical therapy at the local gym, to strengthen any possible sprain-injury situation that may have occurred. To date my knees have been relatively trouble free when i adhere to age appropriate work and leisure pursuits (reducing strenuous projects as i get older). My construction business is slowest in late fall and winter, during which i continue my physical activity at a local gym.  Thus avoiding future injuries.
3079	minocycline	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acne	Treatment cleared the complexion from acne breakout and eliminated the redness/residual under the skin.  This drug had an almost immediate effect on the facial and back areas of the patient.  If the patient stopped taking the minocycline, the acne almost immediately returned.  It kept the bacteria at bay while on the medication.	There were no adverse side effects.  The medication stated to take with food, but on those occasions that food wasn't taken, there was no stomach upset or other adverse effects.	Take 1 tablet by mouth 2x day or after 6 weeks, reduce dosage to 1xday.  Patient required the 2xdaily dosage for the duration to keep the acne manageable.  When tried to go to a lesser dosage, the acne breakouts returned.
3526	lunesta	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	insomnia	Lunesta helped me sleep the first few times I took them and gave me 5-6 hours of sleep without waking up every hour (like I normally do without taking it).	After taking it before bed, anything you drink or eat will taste metallic-like and that includes bottled water. Drinking a whole bottle of water with that metallic-taste made me vomit and that taste is still there when you wake up in the morning but goes away after you've been awake for 10-15 minutes. Occasionally, I will have hangover-like symptoms like feeling nauseated, depressed, and constant headaches all day long. If you miss one night, you will not be able to get any sleep at all. I've gone 72 hours without sleep once because I ran out and the pharmacy took forever to refill it. In the mornings when you wake up, you will need at least 4 cups of coffee to get out of bed. I've tried everything from reducing the dosage to sleeping earlier than normally and nothing helps to prevent that problem. All in all, not any fun.	I'm still taking Lunesta but that's only because I am supposed to see my doctor this week to discuss modifications and adjustments.
2862	soma	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	migraines/upper back pain	None really.  At the beginning it did relieve the pain and helped me to sleep.	It wasn't long until I became physically and psychologically dependant on the drug and the treatment became much worse than the problem for which it was prescribed.  Soma is listed as a muscle relaxant which is quite misleading. Because it has been cleverly marketed, it is readily prescribed (or was) and very accessible. I think many pain management physicians prescribe soma for their patients without much thought as to the risks.  The major adverse affects is the rapid tolerance developement and short term memory loss.  There were a number of times that I'd forgotten if /or how much I had taken, which on one occasion precipitated an emergency room visit. It should be classified as a schedule 2 drug at least because of the potential for abuse and overdose. I think this drug should be taken off of the market.	There aren't any treatment details.  The pain management physician prescribed the medication each monthly visit and increased the dosage not long after introducing the drug as treatment.  These kinds of physicians are really drug dealers cloaked in an DEA approved office.
1087	effexor	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"I did not experience the ""brain-fog"" that I did with Celexa. I felt great after the first couple of days - relieved the depression immensely."	I was one of the few who experienced severe constipation from taking Effexor. Thankfully, this side-effect abated after two weeks. I've also noticed that just one of my eyes appears to have decreased in visual accuity - from 20/20 to maybe 20/30-40.	After using Celexa for 7 years, it decreased in its helpfulness. Celexa always made me feel like I was in a fog as well - hated the stuff. Immediately after taking Effexor, I felt the fog lift and I can't begin to tell you how relieved I am,  or how greatly that improveed the quality of my life. I still have moments where I feel a little anxious, but as a whole, the depression is being taken care of. When I noticed a decrease in visual accuity in my right eye, I stopped taking the drug. My eyesight seemed to return to normal. Oddly, my left eye is fine, but it was always extraordinarily good.
576	lithium-carbonate	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar disorder ii	"Mood more level. My speech is slower, not as pressured. I tend to listen better. I feel more ""chill"", though I still do experience free floating anxiety. My mood is significantly improved, but the anxiety, while lower, is the most stubborn of the symptoms."	Thirst, tremor, slight weight gain, occassional nausea	I have been taking the medication for a year. I had started at 900 mg daily, but found that while I was improved, there was still room for improvement, so the dose was increased to 1200 mg/d. Of all the medications I have taken for bipolar disorder, this has been the most effective; and the cheapest too lol!!
735	metoclopramide	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	nausea	There were no treatment benefits from this particular drug.   My nausea was not controlled at all, in fact I felt more nauseaus after taking the medication.	I had severe restlessness, developed an intense feeling of anxiety, had an extreme desire to sit down, then lay down and went on to develop a dystonic reaction.   I developed an intense feeling of doom, my stomach had feelings of cramps, knotting and pain.  My neck felt tense and the ambulance was called and I was taken to the emergency dept of local hospital.	Ambulance officers gave me pain relief and this settled my stomach of the knotting and cramping/pain.  This also settled the feeling of doom.   In emergency, after numerous examinations and questionning, abdo xray, I was given IV hydration x 2 litres and Ondansetron IV x 2 - 8 hours apart.  I was observed in emergency overnight and went home the next morning with no side effects at all.   Never will I take maxalon again!
3989	fosamax	2	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	osteopenia and osteoporosis	The bone mass in my spine improved.   One hip was stable and one had lower bone density	none	I took the fosamax with 8 oz. of water and walked around for an hour.The first couple of years I did not take calcium supplements.  Then I did.  Since I do not think the results were really an improvemrnt, Now I am taking a calcium supplement with vitamin D and magnesium and a fairly new drug called foseum which is suppose to be entirely natural like an herb, but more expensive than fosamax that must be taken twice a day.
3757	spironolactone	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	The benefits are helping to control my cystic acne. I used to have very painful acne cysts that caused major scarring on my cheeks and chin. I did use accutane for about 4 months to clear it up. However, I still breakout. Not with cysts but smaller pimples. They seem to form in a cluster in certain areas. I have tried all kinds of topical as well as oral medication to keep these breakouts at bay. Spironolactone has pretty much helped reduce the breakouts to almost non existant. My face is also less oily.	The only side effects were temporary breast discomfort. I swear they got bigger. That however did subside and I no longer have that discomfort. The other side effect is frequent urination. If I drink a lot of water during the day I have to go all the time but even if I don't I still have to when I drink water or whatever. It's a little annoying but the pros far out weigh the cons.	I simply take one 100 mg pill a day after I have eaten and drink plenty of water. I usually take it in the morning. I use spironolactone in conjuntion with Ziana topical cream. This combination has really helped to basically rid me of acne. Thank goodness, since I am almost 27 years old and it is embarrassing to still get acne. I love this stuff!
238	wellbutrin-xl	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	low energy and depression	I became a happier person and felt like living and being active again. I was a better mother and wife. I could focus and was not lethargic or sad.	The side effects mostly were related to low sex drive.	I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and then depression. I was treated first for the hypothyroidism and then the depression. The Zoloft worked but I still felt like I had a lower than normal energy level. My doctor added in the Wellbutrin to give me the energy boost.
2267	lexapro	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Lessened anxiety,brought about more attention	drowsiness,lethargy,lack of deep emotions	take one pill daily
2475	enbrel	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	psoriasis	getting rid of plaque and the redness and itchiness and the ugly sight of it. being able to wear short sleeve shirts in the summer	there were none basically. maybe a little soreness but it's like that anyway. it's only when applied and only for a moment	just the application
2573	klonopin	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	"Reduce anxiety and panic. Able to ride subways and go into
crowded areas without fear of panic attack
flying is now much easier because the fair of having a 
panic attack is not there"	"Very mild tiredness but once dose is worked out
side effects are slight"	cbt plus meds
2197	avapro	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypertension	Since I've started the treatment, my tension has stabilized. I've monitored it quite frequently after beginning the treatment to see assess the progress. It seems to also have an impact on my ability to maintain a lower blood pressure than before during physical activities.	None that I've noticed.	My doctor has prescribed one tablet daily as an ongoing treatment.
1436	tirosint	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	mild hypothyroidism	TSH numbers brought down to normal levels, seemed to improve constipation, dry skin and cold intolerance	Increased fatigue and sleepiness were the worst side effects.  On the 75 MCG dose, which put me into Hyperthyroidism according to TSH numbers, I fell asleep in public twice.  This has NEVER happened to me before.  I could not get up in the mornings, was tired all the time and had brain fog.  I think I could've slept 24/7.  Very frustrating.  Also had weight gain.	Began at 75 MCG and they lowered my dose to 50 MCG and the fatigue/sleepy/brain fog symptoms got better (I did not fall asleep in public again) but I was still more tired and foggy than I was before I began taking the medication.  I took the medication in textbook form--first thing in the morning and did not eat for 4 hours.  Finally, the doctor gave me permission to stop taking because I was afraid the physical symptoms were going to negatively impact my job.  Had my blood checked last week after one month off the medication and numbers showed I was back in hypothyroidism.  Doctor is mystified at my symptoms, which for the most part seem to be the opposite of what they should have been on the medication.  He prescribed me Armour today and I am scheduled to go back in 6 weeks to have my blood checked.  I am a healthy, 36 year old female.  I exercise regularly and attempt a healthy diet.  We'll see if this works better for me.
2066	metformin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	diabetes	My blood sugar is under control. I went from an A1c of over 8.0 to an A1c of 5.3 over the course of treatment. This medication has had minimal side effects and I developed a tolerance to the side effects in a short period of time- about 30 days. This medication is easy to take and doesn't dissolve on your tongue thus avoiding a bitter pill taste. In its generic form this medication is quite affordable.	I experienced minimal side effects. Initially while titrated the appropriate dosage and timing of the medication, I experienced some episodes of hypoglycemia. However, once my dosage was adjusted I no longer had episdoes of hypoglycemia. I did experience some gastric upset with this medication in the first thirty days. I had issues of cramping, gas and upset stomach after taking the medication. However after thirty days my body had gotten accustom to the medication and I no longer have any gastric side effects.	My diabetes treatment is three fold. I take medication ( glucophage, gliperide, & actos) follow a diabetes friendly diet and exercise regularly. My medications are glucophage 1000mg in the morning and 1500mg at night; actos 45 mg in the morning and gliperide 20 mg in the morning. My diet is based on a 1800 calorie ADA diet with meals including no more than 60 grams of carbohydrate and snacks with no more than 15-30 grams of carbohydrate. My exericse is a minimum of 20 minutes of walking 3-4 days a week.
3595	differin	5	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	wrinkles around eyes	to be honest, I am uncertain yet. I believe it will take months to see results	severe dry skin. I was instructed to use less frequently until the dryness was not an issue	Apply nightly to face. Wash off in am. Do not use more than every other night due to potential dry flaky skin. Use as infrequently as needed to avoid dryness and irritation. This is a long term skin care application and results may be very moderate and perhaps I will see no fifferance at all. Instructed to continue using long term.
2409	synthroid	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroid	TSH went up to 51 when put on low dose of natural thyroid. Doing better on synthroid rather than generic brand.  Still have fatigue, memory, weight loss problems.  I believe there are things that the blood tests do not show. Not freezing anymore.	Still have temp below 97.5 though I don't feel cold.  Difficulty losing weight.  Hair thinning.  Tired much of time though I use to be a very high energy person.  Dr. doesn't seem to believe me, but I know my body.	I take my med each morning on an empty stomach and told not to take food for 1 hr. and calcium supplement not for 3 hrs. I take 1/2 of a pill on Sundays.
1942	hyzaar	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	lowered blood pressure	increased thirst; increased urination;	take 1 Hyzaar every morning
2323	lexapro	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety and depression	After the first few DAYS my anxiety was greatly reduced. I felt less depressed and did not feel prone to panic attacks that I had been having prior to starting this medication. I was very pleased with the reduced anxiety and depression.	At first I had some mild nausea, which went away and then I didn't have any side effects. This medication did not make me gain weight and it did not lower my sex drive- both which were concerns for me.	The medication worked great, and I would have rated it a 10 except getting OFF the medication was difficult. For six-eight weeks I had what I've come to learn are called brain zaps... a strange sensation that is difficult to describe and not pleasant. Lucky for me I had read about this so it did not scare me... otherwise I would have been very concerned. I pretty much just rode it out for those 6-8 weeks and then it went away and I've been fine. If I had to do it over I would still have chosen to take the lexapro because is was so effective for my anxiey/depression which was off the charts when I started.
984	ketorolac	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	pain, muscle strain	This works very well for mild to moderate pain, usually caused by over-exertion, and charaterized by muscle soreness, spasms, cramps, tightness	I did not personally have any problems with this medication, though like with any NSAID, stomach upset and liver damage certainly have to be considered.	I just use this off and on for anytime i have pain and spasms most generally associated with over - exertion
2358	propecia	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hair loss	My hair loss that I was experiencing stopped completely in it's tracks, and I actually grew back some hair at the crown of my head.  Every individual to whom I've recommended the drug has had at least their hair loss stop.  I'm a complete cynic and consider this a wonder drug. Once you start taking it (and if you continue to take it for the rest of your life- hey, that's science, man) you will keep all the hair you have from that moment on.	While they are forced to tell you that there is something like a 5% chance of becoming temporarily impotent, even for the people that effects the literature says that the majority of that small number get back their sex drive while continuing to take the drug. If you stop taking the drug it comes back immediately. I've not experienced any lessening of my libido, nor has anyone else that I've recommended the drug to.	"You have to have a doctor's prescription, but to avoid the annoyance and price of a doctor's visit you can go to several websites that allow you to pay an extra fee, fill out a questionaire and then have a doctor who is on their payroll give you the prescription. That is okay because really if you're having hair loss and you know you are, why do you need a dermatolagist to tell you- ""yeah, you're losing your hair""? It's an idiotic rule that makes this a controlled drug.  Anyway you take one pill a day- that's it, with or without meals."
1487	metrogel	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	rosacea	There were not any benefits.  Galderma changed metrogel and the new formula didn't agree with my skin.	my skin became very red and irritated.	i used the new metrogel.  the old formula is no longer available.  The new one doesn't work for me.
1165	zofran	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	nausea	"The oral disintegrating formulation of zofran is very easy to take, especially
in cases of severe nausea."	Some side effects that are very tolerable include fatigue and slight head ache.	You take one pill to dissolve on the tongue every 6 to 8 hours as needed for nausea and vomiting. This drug used to be used for chemotherapy patients, but now is more widely available for others. For gastroenteritis, it is very helpful for comfort and maintaining hydration.
2907	tramadol	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	shingles pain	None. though suffering terrible pain from shingles, this drug cause a severe adverse reaction and necessitated calling an ambulance. It created sever pain in another site entirely, so effectively doubled my trouble.	Severe upper gastro-intestinal stomach cramps consistent with biliary colic. The pain is so severe that it requires constant movement, there is a tightening sensation round the diaphragm which can easily be confused with the pain of a heart attack.	Prescribed to deal with severe neuralgic pain from shingles. Stopped treatment after adverse reaction.
1864	augmentin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	subungal hematoma	The medicine was taken to prevent infection since a hole was drilled to drain the gathered blood and release pressure on my nail bed.  As a result, I am in the process of regrowing a healthy nail.	There were no adverse side effects.  By taking the medication and ensuring that the wound was kept clean, infection was kept at bay.	I was prescribed Augmentin at 875mg to be taken twice a day for 10 days in order to fend off infection in my nail bed.  Meanwhile,I used topical iodine and hydrogen peroxide to clean the wound several times a day and applied new bandages at each cleaning.  Once the swelling and pain subsided and growth of a new nail was evident, I trimmed away what I could of the damaged nail to allow the new one space to grow and to aid in keeping the wound clean.
916	paxil	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bipolar disorder	To minimize manic depression, patient was having problems at work, can't sleep well, this drug helped to calm patient down, becoming more relaxed, able to deal with normal work load.	Low energy, missing high, also has longer sleeping need.	Took the pill for bipolar disorder, but seem to get into longer term depressive mood.
204	elidel	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	atopic dernatitis	No benefits, only very bad side effects (see below)	redness, tingling, headache, skin lesions and cold sores developing in the place of application	Once I applied it for my dermatitis (the doc. prescribed it to me because she said it was non-steroidal), there was redness and tinging on the side of the application, which I thought was a normal side affect that should go away on its own. I kept applying it diligently as prescribed. In c couple of days there was a rash on the area  ( I called the doctor about it and she said to stop using it for a couple of days and then apply it , since that might have a been a  normal side effect). I did what she told me to, so I reapplied the drug again in a couple of days, there was redness and irritation and then later on the following day I had a cold sore developing on the spot (the affected area where I was applying the cream was the upper lip and the noso-labial folds). Plus to everything else I had a bad a headache, which as I found later could have been the side effect of that medication. I went to another dermatologist and she said that she would have never prescribed that medication for the face especially if I have a tendency to develop cold sores because that medication serves as a immunosuppressant.
190	adderall	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	add	I find Adderall compared to other ADD meds to work most efficiently to help me focus and give me drive and motivation to stay on task without the jitters found in some ADD meds.

If your really chnage your lifestyle as you take meridia you will have great results.
3977	norvasc	5	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	raynaud's disease	Fingers didn't turn white for as long or as often as they used to.  However, my fingers are still a shade of blue, and hands are still cold.  My face still changes colors throughout the day, from pale, to blue, to red.  It helped, but not enough.  The doctor has prescribed 30mg Nifedipine to see if that works better.	None	See above.
438	imitrex	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine	Since my hypothyroidism is being better treated I rarely get a migraine anymore. I get one every couple of months or so. I have to say that I sort of dread taking the Imitrex because I do experience several side effects, but it usually gets rid of the headache so it winds up being a catch 22. I really hate the muscle aches and weird tight feeling in my head and face. The increase in heart rate can freak me out too, especially if my thyroid meds have just been bumped up too.	Side effects for me include: Heaviness in my limbs, muscle aches, tight feeling in head, flushing, increased heart rate, drowsiness.	Take 100 mg at first indication of migraine. May repeat dosage after 2 hours if pain isn't relieved. Thereafter, only 1 may be taken in a 24 hour period.
244	wellbutrin-xl	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	complete improvement in flat sad affect.  Felt depression completely lift by the end of four weeks.	initially insomnia that went away after the first few weeks.  I also lost about 12 pounds without trying.

No hot flashes or night sweats."	Break-through bleeding or spotting,  breast pain and changes in sexuality(decrease in libido). Fluid retention. Brown patcheson the forehead,temples.	Oral dose taken in the morning and evening. Tried the estrogen patch, but did not like the sticky 'bandaid' on my skin.It would get sticky on the edges and be a magnet for clothes fibers.
2540	lamisil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	ingrown toenails	Cured ingrown toenails, straighter growing nails, whiter, clearer nails.	No treatment side effects were noticed.	One pill was taken with a meal daily, at the same time every day, for seven days every other month. The terinbafine was used in conjunction with applying Nonyx nail gel twice a day.  A thin coating of the nail gel was applied to the entire nail and underneath the nail wherever possible twice a day.  The nails were filed down with an emery board on a weekly basis to scratch up the surface to better allow the nail gel to penetrate.  The underneath of the nails were scraped clean as much as possible on a daily basis.  By the end of the first month ingrown toenail pain was gone.  By the end of the second month, all toenails were noticably less yellow.  By the sixth month, toenails are more than half clear & white, with only the top halves needing to grow out and still showing some yellowness and thickness and curving growth.  Blood tests were taken every other month to ensure no kidney damage occuring from the terbinafine.
3607	retin-a	5	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	aging	I felt the cream was helpful.  Once the intitial effects were seen, they seemed to level out.  I used the cream nightly as I did not wear it during the day.  My skin felt smooth and soft after the first week.	Some redness did occur at first.  After the the first week, the redness disappeared.  There was some sensitivity, but that too went a way.  Other than that, I did not have any other side effects.	I went to doctor to find out how to improve skin condition and rejuvenate skin from sun damage.  After a long questionaire and exam, she prescribed retin-A.
3150	axert	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraine	This ia a life altering medication for me.  I get occaisional migraines due to hormonal changes, allergy and weather changes.  This medication stops a severe headache and it rarely returns.  It works within about an hour.  It stops a migraine that may last for two days at times.  I am not a big fan of taking medications but this one is a miracle drug.	I rarely experience any side effect from this medication.  Occaisionaly I may feel a little drowsy or relaxed but it is very mild and even welcome at times.	I take this medication at the onset of a migraine or severe headache.  It works 99% of the time.  Rarely I have to take a second dose (as instructed) if the headache does not subside but this is very rare.  It was prescribed for menstrual migraine but works for other causes of headache as well.
1190	prozac	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression with anxiety	"Within 3 weeks I noticed a ""lifting "" of mood and a general sense of being more energized and interested in everyday activities. I was far less concerned about things which had previously worried me and felt more enabled to engage in social activities again."	The drug was somewhat over stimulating leading to mild feelings of panic. If not taken with food it caused stomach burning. It dramatically exacerbated my insomnia and suppressed my appetite and libido.	The dose was prescribed in capsule form at 20 mg to be taken daily, preferably in the morning.
2336	propecia	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hairloss	The benefits of taking this drug were a slow down in mpb (male pattern baldness). I noticed that less hairs in the M shape were falling out. It also regrew some of the hair that was lost for several years ago in the crown area. I also noticed that thin, weak hairs regrew stronger and thicker.	Side effect were a feeling of tiredness and lowered libido. These side effects passed away after my body adapted to the lower DHT levels in the body.	"Propecia is a medication that is used to treat prostate cancer. It does inhibit DHT(dihydrotestosterone)that is the most potent form of testosterone. It also raises testosterone levels by 10%.

Propecia is also a treatment for male pattern baldness. DHT is known to bind to the receptor on the hair follicle. By doing this the hair will eventually die for those with genetic mpb.

3748	lamictal	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	epilepsy	some control of partial seizures- they decreased from 3-4/wk to 1-2/mo	"I've taken lamictal before (different combo of anticonvulsants) and the dose was high enough to make me vomit-- I'm very underweight and was on a dose of 500mg in a split dose 150mg am/ 200mg noon/ 150mg pm. While it did somewhat control my partial seizures, I was sick ALL THE TIME and had such severe headaches it sucked!
That was 8 yrs ago for about a year. 

This time around we decided to try it again with the Dilantin/Topamax combo to get rid of the partial seizures as the generalized seizures were licked. Smarter doctor got me on 150mg am/150mg pm for a total of 300mg a day. I'm doing well this time with rare bouts of nausea, a little increased acne during titration, some headache during titration, some sleepiness but no other side effects.

2011	vicodin	3	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	post hemorrhoidectomy	Eliminated severe pain post surgery	Caused dry heave vomiting	"Vomiting to the point of dry heaving is just not acceptable, for one, keeping the medication or anything down can't happen and for two, well putting that kind of pressure on the hemorrhoidectomy surgery site is not a good thing at all.  My doctor said to keep taking the medication, but I don't think his brain was working.  Dry heaves means you have vomited up your bile and NOTHING is staying down and you are still heaving nothing.  That was my body's ""reaction"" to vicodin, it was like poison to me."

Some returned when I stopped the drug.	none	I took the celebrex once a day for a month and am now doing PT for the achilles tendonitis.   The only reason for stopping the drug was out of concern for long term side effects (kidney eg).
1363	permapen	10	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	tooth infection	the pain in my tooth started to subside	I went into shock. My tongue swelled up, my face got very swollen.  My heart was racing and I started to sweat something terrible.  I was told that I was lucky not to die from taking this medication.	I was rushed to the doctors office and given another drug to counter the effects of the penicillin.  I was sick from the whole episode for a very long time.  I am never suppose to take penicillin again or any drug that is a derivative of penicillin.
1085	effexor	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety/ depression	a reduction in the amount of panic attacks i suffered, and more control over the ones i do have, a general lightening of moods and outlook. my IBS symptoms appear reduced.	for the first month or so i experienced mild nausea, nightmares and a dry mouth and continue to have loss of libido.	having suffered with severe anxiety problems for several years and having tried several other anti depressents my gp prescribed effexor at a 75mg dose, this was then incresed to 150mg and finally 225mg which is ongoing, my anxiety is now much better and i am able to live normally
3036	seroquel	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar i	The benefits were numerous, I don't have panic attcks for the first time in 20 yrs, and if I do, they are less than 20 seconds.  I haven't had a mixed state or very rapid cycling since getting on it 2 years ago.  These symptoms continued to get more severe until I got on this drug.  Every episode was worse and lasted longer.  This drug gave me my life back.  I lost my job(s) and wound up in psychiatric inpatient care.  But I have become steadily better since first taking the drug.  I have to admit, to get to the point I'm at now took 2 years, but it's better then I was, and it's better than not getting better at all.  The longer I'm on Seroquel, the better I feel.  Also, I am able to sleep because of Seroquel.  At the worst when I went into the hospital I couldn't sleep at all which was making my episode even worse.  Sleeping drugs and benzodiazepines such as valium that were given to me made me feel horrible, very tired the next day, and even made me panic.  Anticonvulsants and even other psychotics gave me panic attacks, made me antsy or made me so tired I couldn't even function in day to day life.  Seroquel doesn't make me real tired, but it  has made a sleep schedule possible again.  I also don't feel too tired in the morning.	There are side effects of course, as there are with any drug.  I have a little more stomach troubles than what I started with but that could be due to the Lithium.  I have also had about 20 pounds of weight gain.  Before the seroquel I was thin with a high metabolism.  My weight is steady now, but at 20 lbs higher than it used to be.  I tried losing the weight but it has been impossible to get it off.  The drug doesn't make me groggy but I know some people on it that it just knocks out.	I have been on and off lithium and paxil for years.  I tried zyprexa, depakote Triliptal and Lamictal, but these made meunfunctionally tired or I had severe reactions to them.  I have a problem where drugs create severe reactions and sensitivity in me so dr.s give small amounts of several rather than a mega dose of one.  I tried Risperdal but it gave me severe panic attacks and restlessness.  I started out with an antipsychotic and lithium at the hospital to bring the mania and mixed states down.  Later I switched to seroquel and Paxil was added to help with my anxiety and depression.  I was on Seroquel at a lower dose than most 200mg to start, 900mg lithium (anymore than that makes me very sick even though the blood tests show it's within normal limits)and Paxil at 25mg.  Now 2 years later, as I am not in a severe episode I can get by on half the Paxil, 50 mg Seroquel and the lowest Lithium possible to keep it in treatment range.  I raise the doses if I have to (with permission of the Nurse practitioner)and I take 25-50mg Seroquel as needed throughout the day if I need to for anxiety, although I don't need to very often.  The combination of seroquel, Paxil and lithium works best together for me.

426	imitrex	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	If I have a classical migraine, I cannot function without taking an Imitrex. Imitrex takes the edge off the pain, takes away the feeling of nausea and I am able to work on the computer, which I otherwise could not do with a migraine. The pills work most of the time but do not work if the headache was not a migraine. The drug used to have an effect quicker on me several years ago when it took care of my migraine within 30 minutes. Today it often takes me an hour to feel better after taking Imitrex.	I usually feel really tired and depressed the next day after haven taken Imitrex. I feel the drug depresses all systems. It takes off the edge of the pain, but still leaves a dull feeling in the head.	I take an imitrex within an hour of onset of a migraine headache. However, I do not take more than one Imitrex per day. Also, I usually do not take it two days in a row, if I don't have to, as the drug makes me feel very tired and depressed the next day.

3998	fosamax	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	possible osteoporosis	No benefits whatsoever, no change in bone density. I took one tablet on the same day each week with plenty of water first thing in the morning and stood upright for the next two hours as I prepared for work. The side effects were numerous and severe, and with continued use compounded themselves to the point that I feared I may not survive the year. My physician at the time refused to believe me and insisted that I continue taking the drug. I began intense research on my own and discovered I was not alone, and would have to make every attempt to save myself.	The side effects began with nausea and stomach pains mirroring acid reflux which even Nexium could not relieve. Then difficulty breathing and irregular heartbeat, extreme fatigue and body aches, finally vomiting matter resembling coffee grounds - really scary!	After extensive research, I began a complete detoxification process accompanied by acupuncture which I believe ultimately saved my life. My advice: listen to what your body is telling you, be aware and be pro-active with your treatments.

1614	avage	5	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	dark spots	I didn't notice dramatic results with this product and it was fairly expensive at $100 for one tube. I wasn't religious about applying it each day, so that might have had an impact on the effectiveness. I didn't notice significant fading of the darkest large freckles on my face as I had hoped. I didn't notice any significant reduction in wrinkles.	I did not experience any burning sensations with this product in the first week or there after. The product did make my face peel significantly the following day and this occured even with the use of an exfoliating facial wash each morning.	I applied the product to my face in the morning OR evening and did it in combination with other typical facial sunscreen products and mosterizers. Since the product was expensive and made my face peel, I tended to apply it only on the dark freckles I was trying to fade.
947	betamethasone	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	trochanteric bursitis	After the administration of the first injection the pain decreased, however after a period of two weeks it returned. A second injection was administered. There was no improvement and undesirable side effects, as described below, appeared.	Two days after the 2nd injection the body weight started to increase. In the forth day it was 1.5 kg heigher. In the following four days it returned to almost normal.  During this period I felt tired and dizzy and fainted at one occasion. The blood test indicated that the concentrations of potassium and sodium were outside the normal limits (Potassium too high, 5.3 mmol/L and sodium too low, 134 mmol/L), in a dangerous range. Similarly to the pH, the safe range for these two ions is narrow. Four days later the potassium was OK, 5.1 mmol/L albeit high, but the sodium, remained unchanged. In additional three days, the sodium was OK,136 mmol/L ,albeit low. I continued to feel tired for the next two weeks	Two injections were administered in a period of two weeks
2951	zyban	2	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	to quit smoking	After taking the Zyban for 3 weeks my desire to smoke was nearly eliminated. I had tried other methods to quit smoking and this one actually worked! Unfortunately I had a severe allergic reactions to the medication (the main ingredient Wellbutrin).	I initially broke out in hives which became so severe I was taken off the Zyban and prescribed a steroid. The allergic reaction internalized and I ended up missing 3 weeks of work do the joint immobility it caused.	I was impressed with the ability the medication had with my decreased desire to want to smoke, but the side affects/allergic reaction was to severe to continue using it.
2122	renova	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	for treating wrinkles	Early this year I started noticing my skin around the eye beginning to lose its firmness: wrinkles formed during sleep could not be smoothed out by using Lancome eye cream.  Though, applying a collagen eye product does tighten up the eyelids, but only on the surface, and causing the skin around the eye to crack following facial motions.  I was very self conscious about the wrinkles. After using Renova (I've been using it for about two month now), the wrinkles are smoothed, and where the skin easily wrinkles is firmed up, supple and elastic.	"For the initial two weeks, where I applied Renova caused a stinging sensation and a mild redness.  My eyes were watery for a few weeks as well.  Also, for that initial few weeks, the skin looked dry and the wrinkles looked worsened in that one-hour ""drug-work"" duration for which I didn't put on any moisturizer.  All the symptoms are gone now, and the skin is denser and firmer and I no longer fear people looking at my wrinkles anymore."	I asked the doctor to prescribe Renova to me.

My hip joints hurt so bad I can no longer go on long walks.	I am looking for a more natural remedy for high blood pressure and control for cholestrol. I do not like taking drugs but do not feel I have a choice at the this time? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
2804	wellbutrin	5	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	depression	I have a long history in taking anti-depressant drugs.  It started in high school with prozac and desipramine, neither of which I have anything positive to report.  In college, after a dangerous stint without treatment, it resumed with luvox, and  later it was effexor.  Finally, after the scariest bout of all, leading to a stay in the hospital, they put me on wellbutrin.  Combined with rigorous therapy, dbt (dialectical behavioral therapy) groups, and much personal work, I got my head above water.  I was able to work, eat well and exercise regularly, but many of the symptoms were still there.  I thought that was the extent of what an anti-depressant could do for me, the rest of the work was up to me and maybe in about 20 years I might be able to feel happiness.  Since then I went off wellbutrin during a cross-country move, was part of a study for treatment resistant depression where it was recommended I try cymbalta.  I feel the cymbalta has actually influenced my negative thinking and given me more energy.  So now I know that an anti-depressant can potentially create better results than just keeping ones head above water.	"None of the previous meds I mentioned, however did a damn thing but cause me to shake, be continuously thirsty and not be able to achieve orgasm.  The wellbutrin was great in that it didn't cause any sexual side effects.  That was a relief.  The ability to reach orgasm seems as if it should me a basic right for every human being, and the emptiness that replaces the disappearance of the bodies biological ability to feel good, just doesn't seem right.  I was very adament in telling my psychiatrist that I didn't want anything that caused sexual side effects, which most anti-depressants do.  The cymbalta causes the ""emptiness""  but honestly, the improvement it has made in my mood and productivity make it worth it for now.  Plus, I'm not in a meaningfully intimate relationship at the moment.  It seems to only cause and inability to reach inner orgasm however.  Clitoral orgasm is still possible with vibrator and not a human being.   Recently they have added a dose of wellbutrin to my regimen as an attempt to counteract the sexual side effect caused by the cymbalta.  I do not yet know if this is working (Like I said, I have no boyfriend so I don't even know why I'm bothering.  Really I did it to see if the addition of wellbutrin would make me feel even better.  I haven't felt much difference."	"Once a month I see a psychiatrist, although I am ""in between"" doctors right now because my previous one left as they always seem to do.  I have been without a therapist for a while now, wanting to take a break from the time and monetary commitment  that therapy demands.  I am  beginning to think that now is a good time to go back to it.  I consider the jogging, yoga, healthy eating and vitamins I take to be a part of my treatment."
4141	percocet	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	menstrual migraines	decreased ER visits due to control of the migraine at onset.  Lower stress level with the migraine due to medications quick action.	I did have some nausea if I took more than one tablet at a time, but I usually fell asleep after taking one then woke up with out my migraine so it was well worth it.	I had been having menstrual migraines for some time and would always end up in the er when ibuprofen and acetaminophen didn't work (i had tried other migraine meds that didn't work either) So my Dr. prescribed percocet, I usually end up taking it once every 3-4 months.
3035	seroquel	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	anxiety	None.	Seroquel caused severe paranoia in larger doses, severe tiredness in lower (25 50 and 100mg)doses.  Paranoia was so severe, any simple noise caused erratic heart rate and rapid breathing. Drug also caused an inability to move, as if being restrained or weighed down in larger doses. After two years of not taking the drug, and only a week at the highest dosage, there are still problems with low lying feelings of paranoia. Ex; being afraid to go outside at night or be near a window at night or anywhere alone during the day when that was never a problem before the medication.	25mg once at bedtime to start first week, then 50, 75, 100, 150, then 200mg final dosage after weekly increase. Tiredness was suppose to subside in increased dosages, which really I feel it was so highly increased that it had a reverse affect and made it impossible to sleep or move or even hear a pin drop without thinking it was the front glass door being broken into.

Horrible nausea.. started almost immediately after taking the pills and would continue for a couple of hours.	I battled a sinus infection with home remedies for two weeks. Finally gave up and went to the doc.  He said to try this Levaquin as it may help specifically with the sinus infection.  I took the first dosage, felt ill in ten minutes and stayed quite nauseous for two hours.  I did eat cottage cheese with it. Next dose I tried eating some biscuit, but that didn't help either.  Tried it with protein (meat( third dose, same results.  Gave up and went back to doctor, got a zpak.

While I was using the medication to treat cystic acne I also saw a significant improvement is white heads and black heads.  White heads on my forehead virtually disappeared.
3974	norvasc	1	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	high blood pressure	Lowered his blood pressure with one pill to the point of passing out, and having severe cramping.	"One does dropped his blood pressure so low that it was necessary to have him hospitalized for kidney malfunction. It caused severe cramping of the intestines due to lack of blood flow. At admittance to the ER, he was put on IV to increase the blood preassure. The doctors did not believe that the Norvasc could have a severe effect because the Lisinopril, which ordinarily is the medication that causes severe reactions, did not effect his blood pressure. The one Norvasc pill caused his blood pressure to go from 185/109 to 64/43. It is important for all doctors to realize that while drug testing can give you the general reaction of most people; it is imperative to be conscious that some patients will react in a completely unexpected way. This is a situation where the man's experience with opposite reactions to caffeine, and other ""uppers"" to the norm would have given some indication that his reactions to medications can be contra-indicated."	Post emergency, the doctors felt that the reaction had to be caused by something else other than the Norvasc. They tested for urethral artery narrowing, kidney malfunction, etc. with all tests coming out normal. It was finally determined that the patients reaction to this medication was unusual, and the medication should not be repeated.
1144	grifulvin-v	5	Ineffective	No Side Effects	tinea barbae	None YET	None	I was diagnosed with a fungal infection of the beard (or Tinea Barbae). It is a form of follicular infection caused by a fungus of the hair follicle. My derm cultured some of the dead skin cells and in the mean time while the results are pending, put me on Griseofulvin because my symptomns were positive for fungal (a bacterial culture was also administered and was ruled negative). This is a similar treatment for cases of Ringworm of the skin or scalp. Griseofulvin has poor absorption unless taken with a fatty meal. I take (1) 500 mg tablet a day for 4 weeks until I have my next check up. I just completed week 2 and have seen NO signs of improvement.

The first time I took it my skin cleared up in 3 days.  Not only did my acne disappear but my excessively oily skin turned normal in 3 days as well.  Things were great for the time that I was on the medication but about 1 month after finishing it my skin returned to its old self - moderate/severe acne and extremely oily.  I took the second course of this medicine about 1 year later.  The second time was the same dose and time - 30mg per day for 3 months.  It had absolutely no effect on my acne or oily skin the second time around.  I am still battling this problem 10 years later.

4011	celexa	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	stress, feeling overwhelmed	Most say it takes 6 weeks for this drug to really be in your system. After taking for 3 days I could feel the effects, I was much calmer and able to handle stressful situations, and back to myself. My problem was that small daily stresses tended to become much larger than they should have. I am now much more able to let small things roll off my back.	I have gained weight. Whether it was due to celexa or turning 40, I am not sure. Irregardless, the benefits have far outweighed the weight gain, if it was due to the Celexa	Initially started at 20 mg., worked great. During an exstremely stressful time where increased to 40 mg. I will be reducing down to 20mg very soon.
1560	methotrexate	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	uveitis, inflmmatory arhtiritis in hands	Reduction of oral prednisone and prednisone eyedrops w/ eventual stoppage. Uveitis cleared. Inflammatory arthritis is ongoing. I am undergoing new treatment with MTX currently.	"Oral: nausea, felt absolutely yucky for 48 hours post dose.
Went sub-q and felt much better."	"Prepped with Zofran and followed with daily Folic Acid and regular blood tests.

Same protocol this time. Using sub-q,not willing to try oral again."
1271	provigil	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar disorder with severe lows & fatigue,	I do feel much more awake, but I still need a nap everyday even after taking both of my doses. With 8-10 hours of sleep I'm still very fatigued, but I am able to think more clearly...and even drive again. My mood is much better and seems to be more stable than before. The endless fatigue used to spin me out of control and send me into rage, and the only way that I could deal with the rage was to clean like mad crazy and put my focus on ANYTHING other than the real issues...all the while never eating or drinking anything for weeks at a time. From there I would become extremely manic and focus only on organization, my eating disorder and cleaning. This hasn't happened at all since taking provigal in combination with Cymbalta. I did read that this medication is not recommended for people with a history of mania, ocd or eating disorders....but I feel that it's been very effective in the long run for me.	Acne!!!!!!!!!! ACNE!!!!! I had a bit of anxiety when I first began taking it, but that has since gone away. My heart raced for a couple of weeks, but It's hard to tell if it really was the provigil simply because my heart often races at random. I had a bit of trouble sleeping the first 3 nights after taking provigil, but this hasn't been a problem AT ALL since. I have lost some weight that I had gained back just before starting provigil, and this has left my husband and therapist a little concerned, but I still get hungry and have not changed my diet...but the provigil IS the cause and I have no doubt about it. I did not refill it for three weeks earlier this year and gained nearly 10 pounds...so this drug would be fairly effective for weightloss.	My bipolar disorder is often at the lowest points more than the highest points anymore. In the past I switched moods much more rapidly and was given the diagnosis of Rapid cycling bipolar disorder. After my first daughter was born it only got worse. Weeks without any sleep! Then when my second daughter was born something changed within me. I couoldn't wake up at night to even hear her cry. My husband took vacation time to stay home to let me rest. I relapsed worse than ever with my eating disorder and required my 3rd feeding tube and I just could not function enough to even take care of myself, normal life or even my baby girls. I was go into fits of rage from the sheer exhaustion and would CLEAN FOR DAYS AND WEEKS without eating , drinking, sleeping or even sitting! Then I would crash! Finally my doctor decided to jusy try provigil, and it has helped a great deal along with cymbalta. I'm not sure why becasue according the everything I know about both medications...they are completely wrong for me. However, nothing else has worked thu far. I have taken EVERYTHING! This has been a dream for me even if I don't have as much pep in my step as I would like....I'm not a blank, lifeless, useless zombie.
3870	levoxyl	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypothyroid	My hair had been falling out, and it finally stopped after taking this for a while.  Now it is growing back and getting thicker.  Before I was always cold and my hands would even get numb from being so cold all the time.  Now I am finally warm and don't have to wear a sweater  in the summer.	After I take it in the morning I feel nauseous unless I eat something when I take it.  It is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach, so sometimes I do this, but feel queasy for an hour or so.	This is something that I will probably continue to take.  Even though it makes me a bit nauseous, the benefits greatl outweigh the risks for me.  It is so nice to be able to be warm again, and for my hair to be growing back.
2922	tramadol	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	2 compressed discs in neck	Completely eliminated neck pain. Interestingly, did not reduce slight-to-moderate left hip pain (see article on pain in 11/09 issue of Scientific American)	Slight euphoria, slight tiredness, but cannot sleep.	I've had 2 compressed discs in neck for over 5 years. Had taken Hydrocodone plus Tylenol for a few months, but it had nasty side-effects (I don't know how Dr. House does it). Tramadol has worked consistently and effectively for over 2 years now.
3244	nuvaring	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	pregnancy prevention, cycle regulation	I don't have to worry about forgetting to take a pill or a condom breaking.  I have had no vaginal dryness,my sex drive is still the same (high), no cramping, matter of fact, I was cramping very badly the day that I started the ring and within an hour of insertion, my cramps went away.  I actually had blood clots before I started the ring, and now my periods are so much more lighter so I am not clotting at all. :)  Also, my period duration has been cut in half from 5-7 days to 3 or 3.5 days.  I think it's AWESOME!!  My partner does not feel it at all and we have it enthusiastically (vigorously)!	I had a very bad headache for about a week, but it's ok now.  I had a sinus infection last week, and I thought it was from it being springtime, but then I read that sinus infections could be a side effect.  I felt pretty awful last week and wanted to sleep a lot.  I am still not sure if it was just allergies or not.	I feel sorry for the women who have had negative side effects with the Nuvaring.  So far so good, so I am sticking to it!!
1674	claritin	5	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	allegry	cleared head and sinsus	"1rst week no sleep
after 1rst week - tired"	taken daily for sinsus pressure
3962	prilosec	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	gerd	Relieved Gerd symptoms.	Caused severe constipation, gas, gas pains and left side pain.	My dog died and I had chest pains and other Gerd-esque symptoms. I went to doc, they gave me a sample of Prilosec. I began on it and developed the problems. I stopped taking it for about two days, I started feeling bleh and the symptoms Prilosec caused started to go away. To make sure it was the Prilosec, I took it again. The side affects returned within a hour. I am now struggling to get rid of the symptoms and the withdrawal. I would not recommend Prilosec to anyone.
3917	nexium	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	gerd with laryngeal spasms	almost complete elimination of gerd symptoms--reflux,heartburn,nausea,choking spasms, cough.  I have also been able to eat a wider variety of foods without discomfort.	Little to no side effects.  Occasional stomach discomfort,gas, diarrhea, but these could also be associated with irritable bowel syndrome.  All in all, very few problems with this medication compared to its benefits.	Previously took Losec, but continued to have problems with choking spasms, which became increasingly distressing.  The doctor prescribed Nexium at a lower dose, 30 mg., which helped but did not eliminate symptoms.  Increased to 40, and have been happy with this dose ever since.  The doctor tried reducing it once, but I had a choking spasm within two weeks, so we increased it again.  She was a little concerned about risk of osteoporosis, but bone density tests have been normal.
2390	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	fatique, depression	Increase in energy, immediate weight loss.	None noticable.	"I had long complained of fatigue, listlessness, disinterest.  I exhibited classic symptoms of hypo-thyroid, but did not check out as such in the standard blood test.  A new doctor understands that not every person will fall within ""standard"" test results.  God bless her.  The results were rapid and positive with an increase in energy, loss of about 10 pounds of excess weight."
2257	lexapro	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/anxiety	better outlook on life in general, less anxious, easier to deal with everything, a difference of night and day	during the initial dose(first week to ten days) a bit of nausea,strange sensation in teeth and my head felt a little odd	I am happily married with two children, ages three and five. For years I cried everyday, freaked out at the drop of a hat, yelled all the time, had no self esteem and sometimes thought I could not go on. After two weeks of taking Lexapro I am a completely different person. I have not cried once after the first week of being treated. I love myself and my kids. All the menial tasks that I felt so difficult before, I now do with a great sense of ease. My friends and family notice a huge change in me. I couldn't be happier.
2880	avita	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pigmentatation	I used this cream very religiously. I was very particular about avoiding sun which is a must with thos medication.. I have to say that I have gotten rid of my pigmentation. My skin is very smooth and it also takes cate of ocassional breakout. My pore size has become smaller.	Side effects are not negligible. I feel my skin has become profusely sensitve.I feel intense heat on particular areas of my face when I am out in the afternoon , even thopugh I am stanidng in the shade..	I started using this cream about 7 monmths ago. I had pigmentation problems. i am still using this cream but noe , i have reduced its usage to everyother night.
2861	soma	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	back pain	The pain in my back and neck caused stress and spasms. The medication relived the pain , nearly completlly, and allowed the spasms to subside. I tried anti inflamatories before for this re occuring problem and found them to be nearly useless. Strong pain killers like darvocet and vicadin are affective but do not allow me to maintain any normal activity during the drug use.	I found that after two to three doses ther seems to be a cumulative affect of the drug on my sense of balance. This is very mild, and only leaves me feeling a bit light headed at times. I am still able to engage in most of my normal neccessary activities around my home. I do refrain from driving or any other possibly risky activity when on this medication. Also , when I have prolonged pain and require several days of medication, I have noticed slight constipation. This is no where near as bad as the constipation caused by vicoden or darvocet.	I suffered form damage to soft tissues on my neck and back from an accedent. i crashed on a mountain bike and after the inisial recovery period, I found that certain activited can cause a sharp pain in my back at the base of my neck. This, if not medicated, will grow in the course of a hours, into spasms and tense pain. It will cause me to contort my neck and everything I do brings more pain and discomfort. The medication when taken at the onset of the pain, cause the muscles to relax and the pain to subside in a day. If the pain becomes severe and medication is postponed, it may take several doses of medication over the next day or two to make the muscles relax.
3774	metronidazole	3	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	dog bite prophylaxis	Apparently prevented wound infection, though efficacy of drug is questionable and causality cannot be established.	"Side effects were severe. Consistent metallic taste in mouth, upset stomach, sleep difficulties, diarrhea, severe dizziness and anxiety. Transient dry mouth. General feeling of being ""spacey"" and unfocused."	Took metronidazole to preclude infection after a puncture wound from a dog bite. Did not tolerate medication; ceased therapy after 8 days.
2665	prinivil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	nocturnal myoclonus (like restless leg syndrome)	Nocturnal myoclonus (similar to restless leg syndrome) causes severe jerking of the legs every 15 seconds for up to 7 hours. Lisinopril allowed both myself and my partner to sleep at night. Somehow, the drug works without the adverse effects the other sleeping pills, neuro transmiter pills and anti-depressants had.	No adverse side effects, but it did keep my blood pressure down.	Though it is a blood pressure medication, I have never had high blood pressure. I have taken Xanax, Ativan, Clonipin, and many other medications to allow me to sleep, but did not stop the nocturnal myoclonus(similar to restless leg syndrome). This meant I did not remain awake to experience the effects, but my partners did get kicked violently, kept awake with my movements and dirupted sleep. Though it is not known by many doctors, the research was down many years ago on this treatment by a VA doctor while in medical school in the 70s. It has been effective for so many years when I went 15 years without getting acceptable relief.
2831	singulair	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	asthmas/ rhinitis	"Singulair appeared to help somewhat with being able to breathe better.
Rhinitis was decreased.  It helped me miss fewer work days, especially when air index quality was poor."	During the time I was taking singulair I did not have suicidal thoughts but I did feel VERY depressed VERY often.  I was VERY thirsty while taking singulair.  The drying effect lead to a few nosebleeds, mostly in the mornings.	I was instructed by my doctor to take one singulair tablet each evening about one hour before bedtime.
4066	mobic	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	pain/arthritis	The medicine did help with the pain.	Severe stomach issues.	I was prescribed this medication for tmj pain/arthritis.  It helped more than aleve.  The main problem this medication caused me was severe stomach issues.  I was told that the stomach issues may subside after using for a few weeks, but it did not.  I then tried taking 1/2 in the am and 1/2 in the pm to see if that would help, but sadly it didn't.  My husband takes this medication also, and it works beautifully for him.  He has no problems with it at all and it really helps his arthritis.
1623	premarin	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hormone and for prevention of osteoporosis	I have increased energy while taking this medication. It has possibly prevented osteoporosis. My family is quite prone to this, and my bone density tests only show slight osteopenia.	There were no side effects, other than a slight tendency to gain weight. I have had no indication of any other problems.	I have taken one premarin pill every evening.
2079	metformin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	type 2 diabetes	Blood sugar levels returned to within normal limits.  The risk of having to become insulin dependent for my diabetes was decreased.	"I experienced no unwanted or harmful side effects.  The ""side effects"" were all a positive outcome of health improvement, and decrease of diabetes related risks."	Besides taking this drug my treatment regime also included diet change limiting carbohydrates, increasing fiber, and portion control.  I increased my activity level by using a treadmill daily.  This combination resulted in not only regulating my blood sugar levels, but also a weight loss of 20 pounds.
390	seasonale	4	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	only 4 periods a year	had spot bleeding all the time, everyday. my period was light though. had clear skin before and have bad acne once i started taking them. get severe headaches and stomach aches. usto take depo shot and would much rather take it than seasonale. am only taking seasonale because you can only take the depo for 2 years then you have to take a one year break. so far have gained 25 plus pounds, when was on depo i lost weight.	efective against pregnancy.. thats about all.
1863	augmentin	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	cough	I haven't noticed any benefits	My son developed an allergic reaction to the drug - a red rash that spread very quickly and within 2 hours it covered his whole body	I took him back to the doctor and this time my son was diagnosed with pneumonia and dehydration. He was admitted to hospital immediately.
1064	botox	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	wrinkles	Very effective in treating wrinkles by relaxing muscles - highly recommend by trained professional.  No down time, immediate results.  Very pleased with the outcome.	Minimal, but sometimes mild head aches occured for short period of time.	Injections in local area: 20 - 30 units per treatmentat 6 - 8 mth intervals.  Always administered by qualified professional.  Expensive, but well worth it.
187	adderall	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	add	Increased interest and enthusiasm in activities.	None noticeable.	Diagnosed with Adult ADD, I first took Ritalin. I found this to cause some 'nervousness' and to have peaks & valleys. I switched to Adderall XR and find I notice no physical symptoms, only an increase in positive mood and desire to accomplish the days work. The effect does seem to peak soon after the dose, slowly level out, and at about 6-8 hrs. after initial dose, I feel calm but now enthusiastic as earlier in the day.
3645	retin-a	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Since using the Retin-A along with the Accutane, I have noticed a great improvement in the look of my skin.  There are less clogged pores and it definitely more smooth and even in skin tone.  Any fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished but it hasn't helped much with fine lines around my eyes.	It does cause the skin to flake and peel but this can be counteracted with a good moisturizer.  Also, my face gets red or flushed easily with the slightest irritant.  Lastly, not being able to stay in the sun is a downfall.	I use Retin-A 0.25% every evening along with 70 mg of Accutane a day.  I will have to continue the Retin-A for at least a year.
251	wellbutrin-xl	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	major depressive disorder	I noticed at first with the 150mg a boost in energy, and more regular sleeping habits. At the 300mg upgrade shortly into month two I went from smoking a pack a day (25 cigarettes) to about 3. My boyfriend smokes also which is why I still have a few a day. Also after smoking pot it's nice to have a smoke I find.	Horrible dreams, not just randomly but every night. I wake up thinking the dreams are real and always have some sort of false emotion towards my boyfriend thinking he did something wrong. Although I know it's a dream I wake up with the feelings and emotions as if it all just happened. Also have had panic attacks in my dreams and woken up having actual panic attacks in real life. Also, I have read up alot about this drug because I like to know what I'm taking and what could happen... no one has said anything about how hungry you get an hour or so after taking it. I normally don't eat in the morning I haven't since I was 12. But after taking this the hunger pains are so extreme I am forced to eat in the morning when taking it.	So far so good, I will take crazy dreams every night for all the other benefits.
537	trazodone	2	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	fibromyalgia	sleep	terrible pain in my upper right back below ribs and right side.	The doctor does not believe I had this side effects because I took trazaone 2 weeks before I started the cymbalta.  When I took the first trazadone this terrible pain begain.  I tested not taking it and the pain almost completely subsided but was scared to completely stop. I did this 2 times. Then he started me on cymbalta.  I had been on cymbalta for almost 2 weeks when he finally agreed I could stop the trazadone.  By this time the cymbalta was in my system and I continue to have these back pains.  Can anyone share with me
357	neurontin	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	neural pain	Addition of neurontin reduced overall pain severity at the neuropathic injury site (R cervical spine), and appeared to lessen a qualitatively different component of the pain to that helped by tramadol. Combination of tramadol and neurontin in carefully tested comination (to suit patient) brought best pain result to date (injury 26mo prior).	Possible dizziness and fatigue, but this is unclear. Both symptoms were present prior to the injury, but were mild, and have worsened with the addition of each of the three medications. Patient also has a secondary depression following the injury, which combined with the injury itself also confound a clear attribution.	Added 300mg b.i.d. on gradual increase to 1200mg daily, but found 900mg was sufficient.
278	xyrem	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	fibromyalgia	For the first time in years I woke up without widespread flu like pain throughout my body. I woke up feeling rested, awake, alert. Some days were still worse than others, but overall a dramatic difference. I could function throughout the day, wasn't almost falling asleep all the time. If work got crazy and I had to pull 14-16 hrs - which was quite frequent - I didn't get immediately sick.  I actually flew on planes multiple times without getting sick. I used to blink and get sick because my system was so run down despite many hours of sleep a night. When I take xyrem I need only 6-8 hours of sleep and I would wake up and feel great throughout the day. It was an absolute lifesaver for me.	I had a moderate number of side effects that were bothersome but not serious: Oily skin and hair, acne was worse in the beginning, excessive night time sweating - i would wake up drenched every night, acid reflux - this was on and off - tension and anxiety was increased during waking hours. I had teeth sensitivety that developed after starting the drug, rapid pulse (this was weird but it was never a bother), I lost a few lbs and I could eat whatever and not gain much weight. My testosterone levels went way high - not high enough to turn into a boy, but high enough to grow more body hair in places I didn't want and had some hair loss at the temples. I also had problems with short term memory, though I did before when I was in a fibro-fog too. So off the medicine I have a heck of a time still because it is back to fibro fog.  It is a shame because i used to have a great memory.	I would take 3 gms before bed. Wake up 2.50 to 4 hrs later for second dose.  It was easy to wake up, many times I would wake up on my own. Sometimes I would try to wake up too early and would just sleep through my alarm and then wake up closer to the 4 hr mark. If I didn't have a busy job it would just be ideal to try to get closer to 8 or more hrs of sleep every night. That was not always practical for me. I started off at the 3 gms dose twice per night and never had to change. Sometimes, depending on the time of month I got less sleep with the dose - i would awake after only 2.5 hrs later and get around 5 hrs of sleep a night. Depending on where it was with my cycle, sometimes I couldn't wake up so I would lessen my second dose to 2.25 gms so I could wake up at 4 hrs after the dose.
1728	advair-hfa	3	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	asthma	reduction of asthma symptoms and severity, less shortness of breath and light headedness	Unfortunately with prolonged use (after about 8 years)my immune defense system in the lungs was virtually non existent.  My doctors found a plethora of 15 different bacteria, fungi and viruses in the lung, and associated the condition with either AIDS or cancer. Things that are usually prevented by the immune system,opportunistic infections were abundant and had spread, in spite of antibiotic and antifungal use, to a sytemic infection.  Nocardia siriacogeorgensis, MRSA, MAC, aspergillus, pseudomonas among others were all found.  the Nocardia in particualr had already caused a mild form of encephalitis.	Twice daily, one puff, every day.
3967	norvasc	9	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hypertension	Quick relief of hypertension, moving from 150/120 area down to 130/80 region.	Side effects were edema, buildup of fluids in the lower legs and feet. This progressed to the point that it was noticeable visually, and presented problems in wearing of shoes and mobility. Blood testing also indicated a drop in Potassium levels to a low point that concerned the primary physician.	Additional medication was needed to control the edema and the Potassium levels. Triamterene was effective in eliminating the edema. Oral Potassium and Liprosonil were needed to bring Potassium levels up to normal range.
1473	cymbalta	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	nerve damage from brachial plexitus	significant decrease to nerve pain to arm	constipation	I have a history of a brachial plexus injury 8 years ago that has led to progressive increase in nerve pain to my right arm to the point I could no longer lift my camera and was in constant pain throughout the day. It was interfering with work and sleep. In the past, I was treated with short term steroids that masked pain and allowed me to participate in physical therapy. Results were always minimal, but better than nothing. After trying one medication for fibromyalgia unsuccessfully, my doctor agreed to try me on Cymbalta. It took about a month, but the results have been terrific.
3123	reglan	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	delayed gastric emptying-nausea	It worked great! I would not be nauseated at all and could eat and have energy all day.	none, but the doc stopped it as I started needing it less, aid there would be too much risk of weird symptoms.  I still miss it and wish I could have it back.  But I am not as sick or as often I was.  It was just stress and a job change helped also.	I took in the am when nauseated, I would take again if needed but after a while it worked all day for me.  I took as little as possible as I am not a big pill taker
3775	metronidazole	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	bacterial growth	Fter going back to the doctors for a nother swob the bacterial number was back to normal	I would not describe the side effects as drousy but the tablets did make me a bit tired	tablets to be taken with water after meal, 3 times a day for 7 days

Side effects were generally positive, including help with smoking cessation as well as increased libido, which had decreased on Lexapro.

Lexapro was taken in evening, Wellbutrin XL in the morning.
612	innofem	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	menopause symptoms	Benefits: Patch applied 1x weekly assured consistent delivery of dosage. No skin irritation reported by patient but recommended that site used be rotated weekly. Patch can come off if not applied correctly to clean dry skin - no lotions or creams s/b present. May not be metabolized through liver as much as oral estrogen - advantage.	Slight irritation at application site of patch. If mfrs. directions followed and site rotated, this can be reduced or eliminated. No other notable side effects.	"Patch is applied 1x weekly. Treatment continued to alleviate hot flashes. Original dosage was higher and company has come out with smaller dosages. Patient can be slowly ""weaned"" to smaller dosages until no longer needed."

3091	minocycline	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	rosacea/ acne	cleared acne rosacea.	"I became very pale. Gained weight likely due to overburdened liver condition from the drug. Severe bruising on my calves and thighs ( a stated side effect of the drug ), likely yeast overgrowth in abdominal area which lead to bloating, etc.
Graying of the teeth, especially lower teeth, bluish at roots. Lethargy, lack of concentration."	My acne/ rosacea began at age 14, and was treated only topically with harsh over the counter products, with poor result. I began taking high doses of Tetracyclean at age 20. By age 30 I was also adding clindamycin topical solution to help control or dry out the breakouts. Even so, this combined effort was only mildly effective. I never drank alcohol, caffeine, and avoided spicy food while drinking lots of water and having a healthy lifestyle. By age 38, I was introduced to Minocyclean which was immediately effective and controlled my acne/ rosacea. Within 4-5 years, my teeth began to grey, weight gain began, and severe bruising developed on my upper and lower legs. Two weeks ago I phased out of the Minocycline and adopted a strong Probiotic ( 15 billion mc of acidophilus, etc. ) regimen with additional herbal supplement to treat yeast and parasites. I continue to use the topical Clindamycin, and so far the result is very controlled and manageable skin. I am monitoring my teeth and anxious to see if the bruising disappears before long. Antibiotics use create yeast in our bodies, which Acne and Rosacea thrive on. Rid yourself of the drugs, and use the natural supplements instead, and eliminate irritating triggers. Been on antibiotics for 24 years, and now excited to see something finally able to free my from those drugs. The supplement can be found on CandidaFreedom. They also make a natural face soap with the same ingredients. Get off those horrible drugs and at least try it. Give yourself a month !
2206	advair-diskus	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	asthma	Slight initial improvement of viral aggravated asthma.	heart palpitations and coughing began in the second month.  These side affects continued to get worse over time.	I have already completed a survey about the advair and unfortunately did not get the download due to some kind of glitch.

328	ativan	5	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	unable to sleep because of pain	helped me sleep well	upset stomach, drugged feeling all day which causes depression	given l mg of Ativan four months ago with  2 mg delaudid. I quit the delaudid cold turkey.  Tried Gabapentin for pain, made me suicidal, then given Elavil which seems to help for pain,  Am now on 10 mg of Elavil and l mg of Ativan.  Very upset stomach all the time.  Wish the doctor had warned me of Ativan side effects.  I may have been okay with just Elavil had I understood the drugs at the time.  Want desperately to get of Ativan but can't sleep without it.
941	levaquin	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	acute sinusitis	Absolutely none	After two days on Levaquin I began to notice calf muscle and tendon issues. By day three it was becoming an issue when sitting down and getting up, to the point where I thought I might rupture the achilles tendon. I had never had any issues in my lower legs before. By day four I was having a lot of trouble walking and could only shuffle around. I stopped taking the drug and requested a different antibiotic. On reading up on it, I discovered I it should never have been prescribed for me - I am 61 years old and being treated with corticosteroids for RA. It was prescribed by the ER Physician and my Family Doctor.	I stopped taking the drug after 4 days. It took me 6-8 weeks to be able to walk normally again. In the 3rd week we had plans to go to a wedding out of the country, and I required wheelchair assistance at the three aiports we went through to get there. I would have missed my flights if I had had to walk.
2368	propecia	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hair loss, receding hairline	First of all there are a TON of competitors like rogaine on these reviews bashing propecia, how can you only take it for 3 months and have side effects that have ruined your life, i find that highly unlikely. Second, propecia does work even for a receding hairline, if u think your going to regrow your childhood hairline 99% of the time you won't. I have managed to keep my hair and regrow the thin parts and it just feels a lot better. and of course if you take a hormone blocking drug your gonna have sides but they are not bad at all i can still get a boner in about 10 seconds and its not limp. it didnt start really regrowing until about 6-7 months in so u gotta give it time.	not as bad as i was expecting, don't let some little drug mess with your mind man your bigger than that. if any i would say a lower libidio but i kind of like it because before propecia i was wanking off like 10 times a day and now its like once or every other day.	propecia is cool just do research, actually this shit is too expensive but if u care about your hair i would recommend it.
785	naproxen	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	ac joint dislocation	improved range of motion, pain relief and decreased soreness	There were no side effects.	My family doctor prescribed naproxen for continued inflamation and soreness after I had completed a 3 month period of physical therapy for my separated shoulder.  I had been using ibuprofen and/or tylenol and my discomfort had continued unabatted.  I was given a prescription for naproxen, 375mg, to be taken as needed twice daily.  I had been having trouble sleeping due to the soreness and discomfort in my shoulder.  The first night I took naproxen, I slept without waking during the night.  I have gradually improved with a limited amount of inflammation and soreness.  I have noticed improved range of motion in my shoulder.

It helped with the pain a lot and helped me sleep through the night.	I didn't experience any side effects.  It did make me tired but I expected that.  I did feel a bit hung over the next day like you would if you took tylenol pm or similar.  I'd recommend taking it when you know you have 8-10 hours to sleep.	Flexeril has been highly effective for my pain.
1711	retin-a-micro	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	adult acne	The treatments stopped my monthly acne breakouts.  This allowed my skin to heal and broke the breakout cycle.  My skin has not wrinkled as fast as my friends of the same age.	At first I had dry skin. I used it every other day rather than every day until my skin adjusted.  Other than the initial dry, peeling skin, I had no side affects.	I applied the Retin-A to my face every night.  At my dermatologists suggestion, I did not wash my face before applying the cream.  As mentioned above, when I first started treatment, I used the product every other day until my skin adjusted to the Retin-A micro
998	armour-thyroid	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	thyroid goiter	Compared with synthroid that was prescribed to me in the beginning, I have fewer problems, like mood swings, sweating, weight gain, etc.	The problems have been reduced, but not eliminated completely. Alas, perhaps it is impossible :-))	For the last 8 years I am taking 90 mg Armour thyroid daily for treatment of my multinodular goiter.
1197	prozac	2	Ineffective	No Side Effects	depression	None	None	Took for several months, told my doctor it was NOT making a difference so she doubled the dose to 40 mg. I couldn't stand the thought of putting more chemicals in my body if they weren't doing anything so I never filled the doubled prescription and focused on counseling, which made a difference.
3902	nexium	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	esophogeal strictures	It relieved the actual pain of my inflammed stricture	none	Taken at the same time daily
1231	atarax	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	hives	Synthroid aggravated my hives, tremendously.	The front of my legs were hot, swollen, and rashy.	Atarax was prescribed for my hives, and the second day, I started having a bad reaction!
1802	oxycontin	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	post-surgical pain	The pain was definitely reduced, from high discomfort to relatively low discomfort, so long as I wasn't moving. It also helped me to sleep some of the time.	During the second and third day, it seemed to increase my post-surgical nausea. Overall, in addition to drowsiness, I experienced a lot of dizziness. I'm not sure whether or not it affected my bowels returning to normal function.	At first I was given the oxycodone intravenously, with a button allowing me to choose when I wanted a dose (don't remember the amount) but limited in total amount and frequency (up to every 15 minutes, I think.) Afterwards, I took it in pill form. After several days I decided the side effects were too strong and  got a hydrocodone prescription, which had similar but more mild side effects. In retrospect, I wish that acupunture had been available; when I experienced an auricular 5-needle protocol several weeks later, I found the residual pain I had was immediately reduced, with none of the side effects.

I have managed to avoid the condition for many months due to proper moisturization.	there were none, but I was warned that overusage could thin the skin.

And to keep skin constantly moisturized.
3892	dispermox	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	abcessed tooth	Amoxicillin did little, if any, good for the infection I had with my abcessed tooth. I also had a skin lesion caused by a bacteria, per the doctor, but Amoxicillin did not effect this at all. It stayed the same through the days I took this antibiotic.	I had a severe allergic reaction in the form of red, extremely itchy, welps all over my body, but concentrated on my ribs, chest, and face.	After I had the reaction to amoxicillin, I discontinued use immediately.  I took 2 rounds of Benefryl and the rash cleared up.  The doctor then prescribed a much stronger antibiotic, as my tooth pain was worsening - Cipro.

After trying just about every drug on the market, my doc gave me topamax and I started feeling better immediately. The weight loss is a super bonus because I have gained 50 pounds from all the drugs I've been taking to treat my chronic pain, so hopefully I will lose more on topamax.

The Doctor Prescribed 50mg, and still no difference. Finally, I was prescribed 75mg and have been taking that dosage for about 2 months.I do sleep a little better than before, but I still do not sleep through the whole night.	I would wake up and could not fall back to sleep. Also, I have had an appetite out of this world.

3088	minocycline	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acne	Acne significantly reduced or disappeared, but returns immediately upon stopping treatment.

Acne completely disappeared after dosage was upped to 200mg/day, except still get acne during week of menstruation. Acne immediately returns upon stopping medication.
2278	lexapro	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	clinical depression	The treatment benefits were very minimal because of the severe rage that I experienced. I don't think I benefited at all from taking this drug.	This drug was very toxic to my system because it caused severe rage. I really was never relieved from my clinical depression because I kept hoping that the drug benefits would kick in and kept on taking it until one day I realized that I had to stop taking it. After about 2 months, I realized that I was very agitated constantly. I just thought that it would eventually go away but it never did. My nervousness was getting extreme. One day, I was in a grocery store shopping, pushing a grocery cart, and a little boy walked in front of me pushing a toy cart. I was so agitated that I had an INTENSE DESIRE to ram him with my shopping cart. I realized that this behavior was NOT ME and that the Lexapro was causing the severe rage. I also had a constant desire to start running down the street as fast as I could and NOT stop. I also couldn't sleep at night and if I was able to go to sleep finally, I would only stay asleep for a few hours. I sure hope this medication is taken off the market because it could cause some unstable patients to take other's lives from the severe rage.	"This medication is manufactured by Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Forest Laboratories, Inc. in St. Louis Missouri 63045. I was given the prescription of taking 10 mg. once a day. I cannot even imagine what would have happened to me if I had taken the full dosage recommended of 20 mg. I would have probably hurt someone badly. I have always suffered from clinical depression and have taken many different medications. Right now, Paxil is helping me with my depression a little. I think that I need to have it ""upped"" because the usual dosage isn't as effective as it once was. Anyway, my psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro for me because he really believed that this new drug would be just perfect for me. I had no idea that it would cause such turmoil in my life. I was in a constant state of nervousness and my panic attacks had started to get much worse. I just thought that my daily routine was the cause for my anxiety but realized when I had the desire to shove my shopping cart into a little boy who walked in front of me in the store, as I stated before in this report, that I had to quit taking Lexapro. Sometimes, I would sit on my sofa at night and want so badly to just scream at the top of my lungs. My therapist just told me to take a pillow, put it over my face, and scream at the top of my lungs. I was afraid that my neighbors would call the police if they heard me. That was no way to live. This medication was so toxic to me that if I had not realized what it was doing to me, I might have even taken my own life. Because of my great faith in God, I didn't kill myself and finally realized that I had to call my doctor immediately the next morning to report what Lexapro was doing to me. I also have a friend who is taking Lexapro and has taken it for sometime. She also shows signs of rage at times. Just a minor infringement on her and she will go into a state of rage (but not as bad as I did). I have tried to tell her that she needs to get off Lexapro but she just thinks that OTHER people are intimidating her. One day, when she rams her car into someone elses because they pulled in front of her, she will finally realize that Lexapro is not the drug for HER either. I really do think that Lexapro should be taken off the market until further testing is done. I would NEVER recommend this drug to anyone. It is just too unstable."
1795	citalopram	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	I feel better about myself and less anxious and depressed.	I have taken it for almost two weeks now and I feel really tired and increased yawning. I have taken it during the day and at night which in the morning  I feel tired still.	I take it once a day at 20mg per pill. I do better on it now then I do without it. So I will keep my fingers crossd and hope the sleepness goes away.
2069	metformin	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	diabetes	the benefit was a lowering of blood sugar and metformin does that very well without leading to hypoglycemia which can happen with some of the other anti-hyperglycemic drugs.	Side effects include stomach upset and diarrhea but this usually goes away in about 2-3 weeks.	Metformin 500 mg taken twice a day. This controlled by blood sugar but it is important to realize that the medication does not peak until about 4-6 hours after it is taken. This is important knowledge to have in order to time the administration of the drug. When I took it too close to dinner time, it was not as effective as when I took it 4-5 hours before dinner. I wish my healthcare provider or pharmacist had told me when it peaked but that information came from a diabetes educator. I got better control after I knew when to take my dose.
2156	zyrtec	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	allergic rhinitis	no watery itchy eyes, no runny stuffy nose. no sneezing. Normally my eyes are sticky and itchy and I sneez unconrtoallably.

3176	prednisone	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	rash on neck that spread to face	The prednisone immediately reduced the warmth and burning heat of the rash, although the rash continued to spread across my face for several days. It also stopped the itching. As another benefit, the prednisone also got rid of my eczema and--most thrilling--my tennis elbow, which was lingering from 9 months earlier!	"1. Gassy
2. Wide awake at night, couldn't sleep, restless legs
3. Lots of energy--kept working into the night!
4. Seemed to sweat more than before while working more than hot flashes
5. Flushed cheeks, healthy-looking rosy look, added a glow!

11. Felt a bit of a ""high""
12. Sore all over my bones after quitting
13. Very bad watery diarrhea after quitting (unless it was the flu)"	I first had a 60-mg shot in the office; the next day I was to take three 20-mg pills (=60 mg, once a day).  Then, for 5 days, I had to take two 20-mg pills; then for the last two days, I was to take one 20-mg pill each day.
3715	lamictal	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	bi-polar 2	I feel much more stabilized on this drug. However the 200 mg.did quit working after about year and a half, and I was hospitalized with a mixed episode. My Lamictal was raised to 400 mg. 200 at night and 200 in the AM. I am told this is the highest theraputic level for this drug for treating bi-polar. I am much more even but am also still on Geodon and kolonpin once a day. I am weaning off of zoloft-am at 50 mg. once a day at moment. I feel the real med that has helped is the Lamictal, I hope to wean off the rest of meds after being stable for a length of time.	I do not think I have or had any side affects. It is hard to tell because I am on more than one drug, and while in the hospital I was on others. I am also alcholic so like that Lamictal is not habit forming. I am afraid I will put on weight as others have reported.	Diagnosed with Bi-polar 2 WITH MIXED EPISODES AND RAPID CYCLING. Had been perscribed many SSRI'S, due to depression but never fully treated for bi-polar because I felt like I deserved and did not want to give up the few highs I had when not depressed. I also did not believe I was bi-polar when dignosed 12 years ago as an in-patient, because I had no understanding of mixed episodes and rapid cycling. I thought when I was hypo-manic, it was just a great relief and celebration of not being depressed. I was also not honest about my alcohol abuse until about 6 months ago, and have since stopped drinking, which allowed me to realize I was quelling the manis with alcohol, and with out it I was more unstable and manic. My only fear now is that without an anti-depressant I will suffer depression again.
1809	oxycontin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acute and long term chronic and severe back pain	Incredibly beneficial! By using the semi-synthetic opioid dreug along with a homeopathic, long used in europe product, Traumeel (HEEL, Inc.) my osteoarthistis and other spinal pain issues were substanially relieved on a 24 hr basis.

638	seasonique	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	i took seasonique just  to prevent pregnancy	Seasonique was great for me as a birth control method instead of condoms and I experienced no spotting or bleeding the whole 3 months before my period.

Other problems that I have- Interstitial Cystitis, Fibromyalgia, Insomnia, etc.- seem to be improving because of the sleep that I am getting.	I seem to have periods of vomiting that last for several days. It happens monthly and I really am not sure what interacts with medicine those days and not the others. I did build up to my dosage .25mg every 3 days to try and limit the effects.	I take the medicine about 30 minutes before I go to bed because I only get about 4-6 hours of relief.
2874	avita	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	It reduced my acne considerably. It provided a very smooth feeling to my skin that I did not experience with anything prior to using this medicine. It also gave me a rosier complexion with a glow.	The only side effects i experienced were a slight stinging feeling. this subsided after the first two weeks. If the stinging sensation does not subside it is preferable to use it every other night instead of every night.	I used this every night after cleansing my face. I waited about fifteen to twenty minutes before the application. It was also recommended by my doctor to wear sunscreen the next morning since this medication causes skin sun sensitivity.
901	paxil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression/anxiety	I had several episodes of extremely high blood pressure 212/90 was one reading.  It was mainly a product of work related stress and being overweight.  First I was treated with Prozac for the depression/anxiety and became suicidal.  With the Paxil and Lisinopril combination my blood pressure is controlled and I do not suffer from depression nor anxiety.  I respond to outside stimuli in a more normal way.	None	Lisinopril 1 tablet 20 mg daily, Paxil initially was 15 mg increased to 30 mg. daily.
2325	lexapro	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	anxiety depression	Absolutely none. This drug destroyed my marriage. I was so irrationally angry over really stupid stuff. I was raging at my husband for no reason. And it made our marriage crazy to the point that we separated and divorced. I have been told this drug does cause anger in perfectly normal people and that it is like being on speed or cocaine. I would pull this drug from the market.	Irrational Rage. It has nothing to do with my mental state but the fact that the drug does this to everyone. You have to let it build up in your system because your body is trying to reject a poison. You become addicted. No different than cocaine or speed freaks. It is such a lie.	"Once a day. I was drooling as I slept. When I could sleep. I was edgy all the time. I was in a brain fog. And nobody knew that I wasn't crazy. This damn drug was making me crazy. I told my stupid shrink that I needed to be calmer and he gave me speed. I told him I was getting irrationally upset and he doubled the dose. I have been seriously depressed and screwed up emotionally and physically for three years.  I want to sue the drug company.

3682	effexor-xr	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	chronic depression	My anger and depression seemed to get much better within 3 weeks of starting on 75 mg. My dose was eventually increased over time to 150mg.  My family noticed a difference in my attitude.	At first I was very tired so instead of taking the dosage in the morning, I switched to bedtime.	"My depression is better over the years but I have less desire for sex.  I have found it tremendously difficult to maintain or loose weight.  The weight problem seems to have increased over the years to a point where I would like to try and stop or at least decrease the medication.  The problem is that when I wanted to have a 3rd child, I decided to discontinue the medication and the effects of stopping Effexor were horrible.  I have seen problems when I miss a dosage so I am scared to try and stop the medicine.  Before I when I ""weaned"" off the medication I had severe headaches, nausea, and dizziness. I am worried about trying to quit again but I  am having such problems with trying to loose weight that I want to try."
1217	prozac	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"Before taking Prozac I had no energy or joy - I could barely lift my head off the pillow in the morning. I just wanted to stay in bed. When I first started taking it, I could feel it physically - I felt a little ""giddy"" and my eyes felt/looked glazed. But over time, those feelings went away and I just felt normal. I no longer felt like I was on a drug - I just felt good. I could get up in the morning and looked forward to each day."	I had very vivid dreams/nightmares the entire time I took it. Eight years later, I can still remember many of them and the way they made me feel. I gained weight (from 115lbs to 130lbs).	I began by taking 5mg tablets one time a day for one week. The next week I increased to 10mg tablets on time/day. I took Prozac for one year. When I stopped taking it I reduced the dosage to 5mg tablets one time a day for about 2 weeks. I did not have any ill effects when I quit taking it.

I felt nauseous. Gradually I became acclimatised the effects- so after the initial boost I felt normal again - like I could engage with life. After a while (6-months) I felt like I was experiencing a distance because of the drugs, instead of feeling engaged in life like I had felt initially, I felt like I was veiled from it.	I was prescribed increasing doses by my family doctor until he had reached the maximum (150) he could prescribe. I tried to commit suicide, I was referred to a psychiatrist who doubled the dose. After seeing the psychiatrist twice over 2 months. I did not have to see her again. And my family doctor could continue to prescribe at this higher dose.

It was not EASY, but it gave me the drive to keep going because I wasn't so miserable while doing it. I ate a 1200 calorie a day or less diet and exercised many times a week...so I would have lost weight anyway, but it just made it easier."	Dry mouth, constipation at times, sometimes felt a bit like my heart raced under stress after taking it for a long time.	One tablet a day for about a year to help aid in weight loss.

Therefore it is produced to dicrease the risk of heart attack and stroke. After first month of usage the blood test should be performed . The dosage shall be adjusted accordingly and another three months treatment shall follow before another bloood test is done."	I have observed the side effects on my husband, whom I have to remind every dayto take this pill.  First of all, he felt really sick, very nausceus. He had diarrhea for about first 3 weeks of treatment and although he is very physically active because he is  a farmer, therefore he excercise most of the day, the doctor told him it was not enough, he had to excerciseeven more.	This medication was prescribed to my husband byhis doctor becasue he had shown for several years increased and then high cholesterol levels. He was presrcibed some another cholesterol lowering drug, but it was making him so sick, he asked doctor for Lipitor, because he saw a commercial on TV. First, he got 30 days supply, one pill a day, then blood test was performed and dosage adjusted, actually confirmed. It appears he has less side effects with this drug than with previous one. He shall excercise, but he is very physically active, so he does not. The blood test has shown some decrease in bad cholesterol, but not enough and the doctor insists he must excercise more, but he does not. He is due next blood test, but had no time to go there , yet. He is on this pill for about 3-4 months.
1383	biaxin	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	strep throat	The side affects were not so bad. The pills were easy to take, and got them from Publix so they were vanilla flavored.	I had a yeast infection, and also a weird dry patch of skin on my bottom lip.	The process was slow for me, and it did not work in two or three days like the doctor said. I did notice that each day it became easier and easier to swallow things.
3134	geodon	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bi-polar disorder	The benefits are numerous. With the Geodon I haven't suffered from a bout of depression in app. 2 1/2 yrs.. Before the Geodon I suffered from depression for months at a time. I haven't been or felt suicidal at all since beginning the drug. With Geodon I am on an even keel. By that I mean that I do not suffer from the peaks and valleys of typical bi-polar disorder. I no longer have manic episodes for days and then sink into a dark depression. It has made most of my bi-polar traits go away.	The side effects are: dry mouth, possible headache,	The treatment for me is to take 2 80mg capsules of Geodon daily and follow up with a psychiatrist.
1251	catapres	8	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	"Catapres was initially effective at reducing my blood pressure on it's own, but there was reduced effectiveness over time. For this reason I began taking Betaloc in addition to catapres (daily). Taking these two drugs together has resulted in good blood pressure control with a fairly low dose of each drug.

A side benefit of taking catapres has been that it helps to control my Rosacea symptoms. I have had the reason for this explained to me, but cannot recal the details (has something to do with Catapres effect on the sympathetic nervous system)."	I experience slight sedation after taking Catapres which is helpful for me as a light sleeper. I believe I experience some slight lethargy that is ongoing, but not troublesome. When I first started taking Catapres I got a very dry mouth, but this quickly went away. I have experienced no other side effects that I am aware of.	I'm not sure what this question means, and may have already answered it. I am taking Catapres and Betaloc for longstanding essential hypertension. I have noticed that when I take these two drugs together their individual effectiveness is amplified. I have been cautioned by my doctor that it is important not to suddenly stop taking this drug combination as this could cause a heart attack.
2893	premarin-vaginal	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	vaginal dryness/bladder inflamation-irritations	"This dosage works in keeping bladder irritations almost completely non-existent.
Before beginning this treatment I had recurring bladder irritations that felt like a bladder infection.  When tested, there was never any bacteria present.  The urologist that I went to put me on this system of using a vaginal cream.  I began using it nightly until symptoms were relieved or disappeared.  Following that I was put on a regimen of using the vaginal cream only 3 nights per week.  
Without the premarin vaginal cream I consistently had vaginal irritations."	So far, none	Between .5 & 1 g. vaginal cream inserted vaginally 3 times a week.
3484	diazepam	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	airplane flight anxiety	I can now fly without flight or pre-flight anxiety. I used to worry for two weeks about getting ono and airplane.	I will get a slight headache, a few hours after I take the drug. Usually not bad enough that it's actually painful, just annoying.	I take the diazepam about 1.5 hours before the plan takes off. Not hard to do, not that I have to get to the airport so early:).
145	zmax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	cold / flu	Quick relief of flu-like symptoms	I have never had any side effects from this medication.  My husband and 13 year old daughter also take this without any side effects.	The first day, you take 2 pills and then for the next four days you take 1 pill.  The packaging is excellent and tells you exactly what pills to take and when to take them.  As previously stated, no one in my family has experienced any side effects from taking this medication.  We have taken both the Z-pak and the generic form.  It works incredibly fast and has saved us from many vacation disasters!
8	nasonex	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	reduced sore throats and headaches due to allergies	I have had few if any side effects from Nasonex	Allergist prescribed Nasonex years ago to combat my allergies without drying me out like many antihistimes.  I believe that this medication helped me avoid the recurring sinus infections that I had had in the past.
393	hydrochlorothiazide	6	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	Reduced the blood pressure with few side effects at first	dehydration - this problem grew as the years passed and I seemed to become more sensitive to the drug.  I finally started taking a 1/2 dose.  I had dry eyes, constipation, mouth breathing.   I would drink too much beer if I started drinking because I was so thirsty. Dry skin became an irritating problem.  This problem has improved since I changed medications.	The drug was very helpful at first.  It improved my concentration, my ability to focus and pay attention increased and I slept better.  As the years passed, I became aware that I was in a state of semi-dehydration much of the time.  This did not dawn on me until I had taken the drug for over seven years.  I started to keep water at my desk and drank a quart and a half on average every day just during the day at work.  This helped considerably, but the dry skin and constipation finally lead to my asking the doctor for a change.  I am curious if there is any connection between the dehydration and potential dementia.
2904	tramadol	3	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	pain relief (glenohumeral instability correction)	Virtually no pain.	Mental numbness, feebleness, lethargy, depression, cognitive dysfunction.	Due to the above mentioned side effects, I stopped with the Tramadol after just two days and opted for  pain and paracetamol.
80	niacor	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypercholesterolemia w/ low ldl	Very effective increase of HDL	Flushing in the beginning.	"I added supplements after statins were not effective at raising HDL to ""good"" levels. Although excellent at reducing LDL. The most dramatic effect was the addition of Niacin. I've added other anti-oxidants and supplements since, but the measurable results from Nicin therapy were dramatic."
162	zomig	9	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraines-hormonal	"For migraines related to my menstrual cycle, zomig has been the most effective
drug to treat/minimize the migraine symptoms.  With the option of taking 1/2, I could start at this lower dose and try to take it as soon as it was clear a migraine was setting in.  I typically could control it over several days if needed with periodic 1/2 dose."	Drowsiness, occassional nauseau, though part of the side effects relate to the migraine.	Please see above.
3120	ortho-tri-cyclen	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	birth control	I felt great. Highly effective at preventing pregnancy. My skin looked decent while on the pill as well. I had a doctor tell me once that this pill was one the best birth controls to use. I agree, seeing as I am the patient. Its always nice to know when to expect your period :)	None	I took one pill a day, everday, for 2 years.
203	fosamax-plus-d	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	osteoporosis	Between 1998 and 2006, when I was going through menopause, my bone density went from normal to borderline osteoporosis, as shown by the results of two bone density tests given on those dates. After I received my bone density results in 2006, my physician put me on Fosamax, which I have taken regularly for the past two years.  When I took a bone density test recently in 2008, my bone mineral density had increased by almost 6% over a two-year period. I remain in the range of osteopenia, but am midway now between normal and osteoporosis in my T-scores.	I have experienced no adverse side effects at all while taking this medication.	I take a pill in the morning when I get up, once a week, on the same day each week.  I take it with an 8 ounce glass of water and do not lay down, eat, or drink anything for at least 30 minutes. I also take calcium/d vitamin supplements daily, eat plenty of dairy products, walk at least 3 times a week, and avoid alcohol and soft drinks.  I was already following these dietary habits when my previous bone density tests were done.  Because of that, I credit fosamax with the improvement  that has taken place.
1112	effexor	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Signifigantly reduced depression, social anxiety. Mild side effects.	Forgetfullness, some manifestation of laissez-faire attitude (not caring as much about work issues, but in some ways this is a good thing! As long as you don't end up slacking off too much), harder to reach orgasm (but much better than Paxil or Prozac in this matter).	"I've been on Effexor for about 7 years, and love it. It doesn't make you sleepy or passive. It doesn't kill your sex drive, though it is reduced a bit, and it's still harder to reach orgasm. Best part about this med is that it doesn't make you sleepy or foggy. 

You may have to increase dosage after a couple of years. It started to poop out on me at about year 3, and since then I've been climbing with the dosage. 

I've tried many anti-depressants, and this is the gold standard for me. Paxil robbed me of many years...no ambition, no focus, very sloppy housekeeping. Effexor is much better."
1454	cymbalta	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	The benifit of taking the drug was to decrease the symptoms of depression and anxiety. In addition, the drug did not suppress the libido on the opposite it increase the sexual desire.	Side effects were many.  THEre was a decrease in energy levels and dizzines.  There was weight gain. At the end of the 30 days period the feelings of depression were still an issue	The treatment consisted of taking 30mg every morning for thirty days.  Also, started an exercise program to increase the endorphins levels in the brain.  The doctor suggested fifteen minutes of sunshine a day. After the thirty days period the follow up consisted of answering questions about the positive and negative  effects of the drug. After reviewing the answers it was determined that I needed to be on a higher dosage because the symptoms of depression were still an issue.  The increase in dosage was from 30mg to 60mg and still at the end of thirty days there was mo change in the symptoms.  Finally I had to switch to another medication which so far it has worked fine.
3259	noroxin	1	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	prostatitis	The bacterial infection in the prostate was quickly controlled, immediately .	After taking Norfloxacin, I developed severe peripheral neuropathy. This has lasted for 18 months, and still remains.

1429	adipex-p	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	overweight, self confidence	I have more energy, the want to do things (clean house, walk, and normal daily activities). It boosts my self confidence. I am more happy now. I have more fun with my 2 children. I have no appetite what so ever, which to me is an awesome thing whereas before I could eat my 3 meals a day and snack a million times in between. I actually like the taste of water now. I didn't drink pop much at all before but now if I take a drink of pop it tastes nasty so that is a very big plus.	Very dry mouth, diareah(sp) for a few days then constipated for a few days routine, mood swings.	See above, sorry.
486	meridia	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	overeating, weight gain	I lost 90 pounds in 6 months. The key was drinking water all throughout the day. I ate 1 meal a day before 6pm & snacked on fruit (applesauce, fruit cups, canned fruit,etc.)  all through the day (instead of fast food, icecream, chips or any other food that is unhealthy). I saw no results in the first month, but once 30 days had passed, I started to lose 1 lb. a day & sometimes 1 1'2 lb. a day. Even after getting off of Meridia, I still continued to lose weight 2 months later. Product was VERY expensive but worth it! The more weight you have to lose the more you WILL lose!	Insomnia sometimes. My bedtime(before Meridia) was around 10pm but once I began taking the medicine, I couldn't sleep sometimes until 12am or 1am, but even with lack of sleep, I never felt fatigued like I thought I would. Every once in a while, mild headaches & dry mouth. But nothing too major or life-threatening.	Lost 91 lbs. in 6-7 months. Kept the weight off even to this day (4 years later) b/c the Meridia taught me the key to weight loss: Less calorie intake. And since the Meridia trained my body to get full quicker, I was able to still eat & crave less even after getting off of the medication.
1194	prozac	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Reduced depression and feelings of hopelessness within 3 weeks. I like being able to increase dosage when things get a little rough and then back off to the original dosage when things settle down.	"Extreme sleepiness, feeling ""out of it"".  It was really hard to work and be on this medication.  I wanted to give it up as I literally could not stay awake but I made it though the first 6 weeks and things were better after that.  I have been on it for 10 years now and do not notice any side effects."	Took pill once a day and visited therapist once a month.  After awile, I didn't go to the therapist anymore and I was extremely even with just the medication.
13	hytrin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high blood presure	Tried many different drugs all either failed to reduce my blood presure or had side effects which I did not want to live with. Hytrin has brought my blood pressure under control with absolutely no side effects	none at all	I take one tablet of the generic for Hytrin which is Terizosin each night and bed time and am monitored for my blood pressure control by my physician at six month intervals
1238	asacol	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	ulcerative colitis	Flare-ups were less frequent as well and the duration of time they lasted was less. I noticed that it didn't help with the amount of bowl movements I was having but it did help stop the internal bleeding.	Nausea, cramping, abdominal pain were just some of the bigger side effects. Sometimes the stomach pain was so painful it was worse then an actual flare-up.	I stopped taking Asacol because of the intense stomach pain it caused me as well as the nausea. I found that while taking Asacol, my falre-ups did decrease but the side effects outweighed the benefits.
2213	alendronate	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bone density tests showed early osteo.	Very limited for the amount taken.  New bone density showed slight improvement, ie 2 years ago spine was -3.3, now is -2.9.	The feeling of a lump in my throat, due to reflux.  Had to take meds to counteract.  Muscle pain, leg cramps, joint pain. IBS. I plan to stop taking it, and research natural ways to manage bone loss.	Bone density studies were done every two years.  Very slight improvement. After 10 years, I am still not at normal bone density.
2386	synthroid	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypothyroidism	The synthetic thyroid hormone treatment made it so I was at least able to function, sped my metabolism up enough to keep warm and have regular menses.	Side effects come from taking either too little or too much Synthroid. It is a tightrope balancing act and the blood work is not specific enough to guide the clinical course.	"Compared to others who naturally have a functioning thyroid, it is clear to see that Synthroid is an inferior product to what the thyroid makes naturally in a healthy individual. I know that I still have minor hypothyroid symptoms even when my blood counts show that I have therapeutic levels of the medication. Additionally, generic versions of Synthroid seem to be even less effective at relieving all the symptoms, even though the blood counts could be normal. With hypothyroidism becoming a very common condition these days, one would think that new medications would be coming out, but the medical professionals seem content to stick with Synthroid because ""on paper"" it seems to be safe and effective."
379	lamotrigine	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar 2-extreme moods swings	My miracle drug!! I have suffered for years with extreme mood swings, depression, and bulimia. It was several months ago that I was diagnosed with bipolar 2-I was immediately prescribed Lamictal-I didn't really notice a difference so my dr. upped it to 150mg. It has worked wonders! I am so proud to say that I am happy and I haven't felt this elation in years! I can actually stay awake during the day, I have the drive to exercise, my labido is back(sure did miss that), almost no mood swings at all and most importantly I feel like a mother again! I have 3 beautiful little girls that I can hug, kiss, and love again!! I feel like crying-in a good way-everytime I think about how happy I am! My only fear is wondering how long this will last-I can only pray this will last forever.	The only side effects I have (I consider 2 of these not even side effects at all)headaches, staying asleep at night, weird fever like feeling, increase in sexual drive and weight loss. All are tolerable considering the benefits.	150 mg a day-taken before bedtime
3264	zoloft	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	Became less emotional and therefore able to function better in everyday settings,especially as I experienced no side-effects.	none	200 mg once a day for seven years so far has worked very well,and will continue to take this medication at this dosage for at least another year,maybe more.
294	imodium	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	diarrhea	The effect of the drug starts immediately but still the care is needed in the food. The drug is also inexpensive and widely available in the drug store.	There was no side effects of the drug.	The drug is generic and I took the drug at home without doctor's prescription. 2 Capsules days, each morning and evening before food.
1621	premarin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hormone replacement	After my hysterectomy, I was depressed, didn't want to have company, was suspicious of everyone and everything. I wasn't feeling like my former self at all.  Once I began the hormone replacement therapy (Premarin), I began to feel much better immediately.  The depression left and I felt younger and much more able to cope with daily life.  I take Premarin (.625mg) daily.	some weight gain	I have remained very stable and have a good outlook on life.  Do not feel my age.
2534	lamisil	5	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	yeast	not noticable, supposed to clear all yeast from body because I had been feeling bloated, kept getting yeast infections and when I had colonics the lady told me that I had an abundance of yeast.  Makes sense cuz I drink a lot of beer and don't eat too healthy.	none	Take one tablet, once a day for two weeks.  I was also supposed to eat a lot of yogurt and take a pro biotic pill once and a while.  Affects were not noticible and I have no idea whether I really had yeast over growth and whether it did any thing beneficial or not.
761	flonase	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	nasal polyps	Treatment began to work after 3 days. I had not been able to smell for 10 years and my smell is now restored.	increased anxiety maybe not due to Flonase, as I suffer with anxiety any way.	I tried the drops as my nasal polyps were so big that i was suffering frequent sinus infection. I was advised to take the drops for 4-6 weeks before i may see improvement. The drops worked after 3 days, the nasal polyps shrunk I could breathe with my mouth closed and I could smell and taste again. I am delighted.
1069	botox	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	aging	the treatment (eyes & forehead) was highly effective and lasted 6 months each of the 3 times I was treated. I have a very deep vertical line between my eyes which was all but invisible with each treatment. I loved it!	none	Botox was administered to my forehead and outer eye area (crows feet) via small gauge needle. Totally painless. It took about 3 days for the drug to take effect but once it did, it kept the wrinkles at bay for approximately 6 months.
2678	prinivil	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	high blood pressure	The only positive effects was blood pressure moderately controlled.	I wanted to switch from Atenolol because of concerns it would increase insulin resistance. So my Dr. prescribed Lisinopril and told me to take it for 3 weeks to see if it was going to be effective. After 3 weeks it was effective but I started noticing that gradually when I laid down to sleep at night, it felt like there was lots of mucous in my throat. Then the tickle started in my throat which made me feel like gagging. Then my voice was affected. It became hoarse and I noticed my throat felt soar. I searched on the internet and read about side effects from Ace Inhibitors and realized I was being negatively affected by the drug. I stopped the drug, but it has taken over a month to completely overcome the negative side effects.	Take one 20 mg per day in the am.
4099	chantix	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	smoking	Tried to stop smoking for years. Started using Chantix and found that if taken twice daily even if I smoked an occassional cigarettes; I continued to take the drug. Had no jitters or nervousness from nicotine withdrawals. Very effective.	When fir started taking the drug had mild nausea after medication. This went away after a few weeks.	1mg tablet twice daily.
3431	tazorac	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne, photoaging	This is probably the best skin care product/medicine available. It is highly effective for both acne and photo-aging. It exfoliates the skin better than anything else, thus unclogging the pores. It also speeds up cell turnover, which reduces keratinization, preventing comedo-formation. It smooths out wrinkles, makes the deep layers of skin - dermis - thicker, increases collagen production, etc. You can read about all its benefits on PubMed. It has been proven more effective than tretinoin (Retin A) for both acne and photoaging.	Initially it is quite irritating, that is why it is VERY important to start using it less often and with a smaller applied amount. Do not overdose on Tazorac or else your skin - the upper horny layer, statum corneum - will become so thin and dry that it will crack - thus you will actually CREATE wrinkles rather than eliminate any. If you take it slowly and gradually increase the dose, you won't have that problem, as the skin adjusts to it. You should probably start using it only every 3rd or 4th day initially, gradually increasing to every other day or even every day. Some people are able to use it twice a day; I know I cant. In case you develop severe irritation, you must use a good moisturizer to prevent wrinkle formation. If you are using it for acne, and are using other products such as benzoyl peroxide - as you should, you should be even more careful, as skin irritation is cumulative from the various drugs. You will have to use a lower dose BP such as 2.5% because your skin will be exfoliated and more easily irritated.	The gel is more effective than the cream, in that it delivers a higher dosage of the medication faster. The cream however has lower side effects and it achieves more controlled release of the drug. I believe the cream is more appropriate for anti-aging, as it is more emollient. Neither the cream nor the gel are comedogenic so acne sufferers should not worry. I have used both the gel and the cream, with both concentrations - .05% and .1%. I am currently using the .1% cream. There is a generic version available from an Indian manufacturer called Glenmark. Their product is called Tazret. It is virtually the same as the original.
1061	botox	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	I used to have near-daily migraines.  I tried every migraine medication on the market.  Either they didn't have any effect, or I was unable to tolerate them due to side-effects.  With Botox injections administered by a very knowledgable neurologist who is also a pain specialist, I am virtually migraine-free for months.	Sometimes I had some minor swelling at an injection site.  It went away within days.	My neurologist injects the tiny cranial muscles as well as muscles along my neck and upper shoulder.  He uses a tiny needle and injects very little at each site.  He determines where the trigger points are before administering the Botox.  PLEASE NOTE:  If using Botox for migraines, do go to a neurologist who is experienced with migraine pain.  DO NOT have this done by a cosmetic surgeon!
2851	albuterol	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	asthma	Opened lungs when breathing was difficult.	Stimulating--very.	"I used an asthma inhaler frequently as a child.  I think it was albuterol, although it is hard to be certain.

In my forties, I had a recurrence of asthma.  The pharmacist and my doctor both said NOT to use the over-the-counter inhalers.  I did try one, and it was MUCH more heart-poundingly stimulating than albuterol.  Dangerous for someone with heart problems, but difficulty breathing would be dangerous as well.

At some point, I got a generic albuterol inhaler and found it much less effective than the Ventolin brand.  My doctor said that other patients had told her the same thing.

I rarely need it now, maybe only once every two years.  But I try to keep one with me at all times because when I need it, I really need it.  I take long walks down and up a hill and if I had an attack at the bottom of the hill I would be in trouble.

It is almost magic, though--one minute it takes a great exertion to breathe and I feel like I am suffocating--then I inhale Ventolin and my bronchial tubes open right up.  It is a lifesaver.

As a child and teenager I did not mind the slight ""rush,""  I even liked it.  Part of that rush may be caused by the deep exhalation and inhalation required to properly ingest the drug."
2479	enbrel	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	ankylosing spondylitis	My worst symptom was in my feet. It was painful to walk, and therefore I walked slowly even when I used shoes with good support (Birkenstocks), especially going down stairs. There was some pain or discomfort in my lower back. These were my symptoms when I was on methotrexate alone. When I started Enbrel, I felt the effects within hours. Within the same day I could walk decently with much less pain. Within the next few days and weeks, I'm practically back to normal. In my second month, I think I started to feel a tapering off of its effects, which doctors warned me about and I read about: I felt a faint shadow of the foot pains I used to experience but I can still move normally.	None that I can tell	I inject myself twice a week in the stomach area, which is a feat because until this happened, I was scared to death of getting injections.
345	neurontin	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	spinal injury	The Lidoderm numbs my back for most of the day so that the pain is dulled dramatically.  The Neurontin eventually blocked my pain so well I was able to get out of bed after being stuck in it for 4 1/2 months.  These two pain relievers work so very well together.  There is nothing that is going to take all of the pain away.  I am also on other medication for this as well. Being able to walk around again finally, was like, what took you so long to figure it out what to do?  I'm not broken, I'm hurt.  I have children at home, I need to at least be mobile!	Many of the medications I take have a side effect that affects your memory.  My short term memory is terrible.  I can be asking for something as ordinary as a fork, a pen, etc. and can not come up with the word, at all.  I'll be able to later, or the next day, I haven;t forgotten the word, I just can;t get it out of my brain.  The Neurontin has also affected my eyes.  I sometimes have problems focusing; sometimes I am able to read the phone book and othertimes I need magnifying glasses.  This all started a week after starting the medicine.	I have a torn lumbar disk.  I have pain in my back that is constant and gets worse with overwork and high humidity.  I have no feeling in my feet.  My right leg does not work correctly.  The Neurontin is mainly attributable to the quality of life that I have today.  Then the other medications I take all do their part.  The Nerontin blocks the pain nerve signal from registering in my brain.  The Methodone deals directly with the pain as does the Lidoderm Patch.  The muscle relaxer keeps my muscles from spontaneously contracting, which they will do without the medication.  The anti-depressents help me stay positive, which is where I want to be.  I usually have a sunny outlook and the medicine helps me keep it.  When my last medicine stopped working, I was depressed for a total of 6 months.  What a waste of time.
970	sarafem	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I have taken this drug off and on for the past 13 years. I have always had good results with it, but I wanted to go off it to have children. Then, after my last child, I tried to make it without medication, but I realized I couldn't. I am very careful about the medications I take and I don't like being stuck on anything. However, I realized that I needed help and my children needed a happy Mommy. I went back on Prozac (the generic form) 2 months ago and now feel better than I have in years. I can cope with the daily stresses of life without losing my temper, or my mind. I can face the responsibilities of each day without fear, hopelessness, or doubt. I can laugh and enjoy my children. I am truly a new person. I am regretting not going back on this medication sooner.	"Honestly, the only side effect I have had is that it is harder to have an orgasm. I can still have them, but it just takes longer. I don't really feel ""in the mood"" as much, but that is a very small detriment compared to what I was experiencing before. I have had no other side effects whatsoever. I do not even feel ""mediciney"" or out of it at all and no stomach problems, either."	I am planning on seeing my doctor every 6 months and have my blood checked once a year to check my liver, etc., but so far am doing great. I do see a counselor every 2 weeks, which is invaluable to me.
3879	levoxyl	4	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	hypothyroidism	I am not sure if it was levothyroxine that helped to normalise the hormone levels. It's kind of strange, as they've only were back in range, when i stopped taking l-thyroxine.	"Sudden and enormous increase in appetite, weight gain, i gained 10 kg, my belly seemed inflated all the time; 
Constipation;
Mood swings;"	"L-Thyroxine was supposed to increase the low production of thyroid hormones, which was a result of hypothyroidism, as well as to help lower the number of antithyroid antibodies (which indicate the autoimmune disease that may be damaging the thyroid gland).
Levothyroxine (25 mcg)was taken 30�60 minutes before breakfast daily, for almolst 2 years. The doctor told me, that i should take it as long as i live. However, the levels of thyroid hormones have changed dramatically when i stopped taking l-thyroxine, they were in absolutely normal range, which showed, that i do not need to be on l-thyroxine anymore."

59	flexeril	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	headaches	Had a lot of headaches all day every day. Doctor said it was tension headaches made by a muscle spasm in my neck.

I got up at 6 am and reach class at 8 and it was still knocking me out in class. Was soo embarrase. Mind you I took the medicine at 10 30pm the night before.	The treatment is going well.
3025	seroquel	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	Was able to sleep for seven hours at night without waking up.	Bit of drowsiness in morning.	I get depression quite badly and one of the precursers to that is usualy a period of severe insomnia, over days or weeks. Taking the Seroquel helps to ensure I have enough sleep so that depression doesn't often become a big problem. I know it's prescribed as anti-psychotic, but for me it's the effect ot drowsiness that my doctor desired, as I have no psychoses.
1584	xanax	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sleeping aid	Was able to get to sleep and stay asleep for a full eight hours.  Could go to sleep within an hour of taking the drug and was able to still wake up the next day. I take one benadryl with the xanax to help get the sleep cycle started.	dependency.  dependency. dependency.  Cannot sleep without it.  My mind will stay awake forever and I am unable to sleep a minute.  I am groggy if I do not give myself at least eight hours to sleep after I take it.  I feel like I need to up my dose after some time to get myself to sleep.	I take xanax because I work on a morning show so I must sleep when it is still light outside.  Sleeping pills don't seem to work.. Xanaz seems to do the trick.  It calms my mind so I can get to bed and not think about all the things in my life.
2578	klonopin	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	panic disorder	none	blurred vision; inability to function on daily basis; 100% grogginess 24/7.	Was incorrectly diagnosed with bi-polar. Panic attacks for 20 yrs. During most of the 20 yrs. xanax (alprazolam) was prescribed. Worked great; 100% effective. Was put on clonazepam - worst feeling ever; 2 mg daily, extreme tiredness, couldn't function doing daily activities. Dropped down to 1mg per script; same effect as taking 2mg. Prescribed .05mg; same effect as above. Since learned clonazepam is a sedative medication. Would not recommend to anyone.
2689	prinivil	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	It did lower my blood pressure, although my physician wanted to lower it further because I started out on 10 mg a day so the medication doseage was raised to 20 mg which as been more effective at lowering my blood pressure.  Even though my blood pressure wasn't dangerously high since cardiovascular issues run in my family my doctor wanted me to take this drug because of family history even though I am young.	On the 10 mg dosage I noticed that my throat was itchy and scratchy, causing a lot of cough and some gagging with the cough.  For some reason this problem disappeared when I was switched to the 20 mg dosage.  At times I get a bit of ringing in my ears but it is not regular.  I do notice fatigue and although I have started taking other medications after starting the lisinopril I think the lisinopril did affect my libido, although not a lot.	Mostly pleased with lisinopril because it is effective at keeping my blood pressure down.  Due to a one time mail in problem with my prescription service I was off the lisinopril for approximately a week and my blood pressure went right back up, and was under control again a few days after starting up.  I keep track of my blood pressure at home and it regularly remains in a very good range of 128/60 or so with some variations.  I am hoping not to stay on the drug for long term but since my blood pressure went right back up after a short time of not taking it I'm not sure how short term it may be.
967	sarafem	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	This drug improved my mood greatly. I can take more stress at work, in my romantic life, and family situations where as before, I would crawl under a rock and cry. A lot of people say that they don't feel much on this drug, but I think it was low enough to where I could have moderate lows and elevated highs. It helped me control my impulsive behavior with eating.	I had headaches if I didn't take it with enough food in my stomach. I also have insomnia, however, if you cut your intake of caffeine, it shouldn't be too severe.	I took this at noon. It's a strange feeling on this drug because later in the day, I feel a bit strange. Either way, I know what people mean when they say that they feel a lot of indifference come over them at times they should be feeling overwhelming emotions. This drug helps me cope and sometimes I feel like I don't need it anymore, but I go right back on it when I feel the blues creeping up on me again.
3693	effexor-xr	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	Made a huge difference in my depression (post natal) at first. Had tried Zoloft after my previous pregnancy, which seemed to stop working. Cycled through a number of other drugs (8 within 9 months) and ended up sticking with EffexorXR as it seemed the one with the least side-effects initially.	"Weight gain, difficulty losing weight, blurry vision, general 'blah' moods. 
Attempted to taper off & managed to only go from 225 to 150mg for a week before MAJOR side effects kicked in: headaches, brain 'zaps', aggression, agitation, extreme mood swings and hives. Returned to 225mg (for a month now) and still experiencing severe hives & developing allergies to a number of things I wasn't allergic to before."	Post-natal depression & major depression/anxiety.
1080	effexor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	recurrent depression	This drug turned my severe recurrent depression around.	None.	"This drug changed my life. I have taken every antidepressant in the book. I received some benefit from most of them but my depression always returned and many of them had unpleasant side effects, including weight gain and constipation. This drug helped me enjoy life again. I still have occasional bouts of depression due to life cirsumstances but they are much briefer and less severe. I feel much more outgoing and enjoy being around people more. I no longer want to withdraw from the world and now face the world with much more confidence. For people worried that this drug produces an ""artificial"" feeling of happiness--this is not the case. This is the way people are supposed to feel. you will still have a normal range of moods. I only wish this drug had existed sooner--my whole life would have been differnt."
3138	malarone	5	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anti malarial	I didn't get malaria	Prescribed to my Husband and I on our Honeymoon in Vietnam and Cambodia.  On day 4 we both experienced waves of strong abdominal pain every hour or so accompanied by a need to go to the toilet with diarrhoea (but it was non-urgent need to go to the loo - like a normal upset tummy can be).	"Initially believing that it was a normal holiday tummy upset we starved ourselves for nearly 4 days (we were also not hungry) but the waves of pain did not significantly subside - triggered by drinking water.   We then arrived at a Hotel in Vietnam that had Internet access and looked at some lonelyplanet blogs - the advice on Malarone was to make sure to follow the medication instruction leaflet to the letter i.e. to take it with a ""milky"" drink.   We then began to take it at breakfast with as many dairy products as we could - yoghurt, cheese, milk on cereal etc, and the symptoms subsided.  The pain ceased after a couple of days but we continued to have violent, liquid bowel movements for another week...  
It would help if the leaflet explained why dairy is recommended - is it the fat that is required or the alkaline environment?"
3213	tobramycin	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	pink eye	revieved my eyes of the redness and puffiness and fluid that had been coming out of my eyes.	There were no side effets. It did report that I could receive hypersensitivity including iching and swelling but I did not.	Had to put eye drops in daily for about 7 days. Noticed it clearing even after 2 days.
3325	tetracycline	2	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	This did help clear acne infections and helped skin somewhat improve	The side effects included sun sensitivity, upset stomach, tiredness	I was put on this medication by my pediatrician and, unfortunately, I think he did a poor job of following up on my treatment.  I think that antibiotics are too strong a treatment for acne.

3093	minocycline	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	My skin cleared considerably in about two weeks after starting this medication and has remained relatively clear over the 10 months i have been taking it.  I have far fewer hormonal breakouts around my chin and my skin seems generally less congested with fewer blackheads.  I have also noticed a reducation in oil on the surface of my skin.	This product has made me more sensitive to the sun.  I think my skin has burned or discoloured very quickly after having been in the sun, even while wearing sunscreen.  I have also noticed increased pigmentation on my foreheard and at my temples.	I have been taking this product consistently for about 10 months.  I take one tablet, twice a day with meals - usually one at the beginning of the day, another at the end of the day.
440	avodart	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hair loss	The treatment stopped hair loss and caused some regrowth. Some loss of effectiveness (I beieve due to worsening of underlying condition), but adding a topical solution corrected this.	Difficult to know. May have been slight reduction in libido, and occasional mild depression/anxiety, but not sure about these.	0.5mg taken 5 x per week in the morning. Started taking avodart but then moved onto generic ('Dutas') with no change in effectiveness.
3674	effexor-xr	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety and depression	Brought me out of a severe, didn't-care-if-I-lived depression without making anxiety too much worse. Not perfect but works well enough that I don't want to quit taking.	Starting it and titrating up caused interesting side effects: low blood sugar, big pupils, palpitations (all were temporary). Now if I miss a dose, I get bad night sweats and wierd dreams, and quickly remember to take it again.	Started at 37.5 mg for few days, then 75 then 112.5 then 150mg. Did well initially, then was increased to 225 mg several months later. Tried 300 mg for a while but not much difference from 225. Will have to taper down if I ever stop the med.

3638	retin-a	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	flat warts	skin cell turnover increases	painful skin sloughing	For flat warts on the face, was prescribed Retin A by a dermatologist.  I started out every other day for 2 weeks and then increased use to daily.  The skin area did improve however there was painful chapped skin that would crack and hurt.  Moderate improvement seen but return to condition after stopping the treatment.
3803	cialis	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	ed	The treatment was very effective in producing an erection when sexualy stimulated.	An occasional headache was experienced while taking the medication but was releaved by asprin.	As important as the physical action of the drug is, the psychological effect of being able to function sexually is the greater benefit. The increase in self esteem without the use of anti-depressants is amazing.
1123	evista	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	ostheoporosis prevention	Reduce the chance of ostheoporiosis	None	Take one evista once  per day
1840	yasmin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	cramps, birth control	Treatment benefits included prevention of pregnancy, clearer, more manageable skin, reduced menses and significantly reduced cramps. I never had another huge cystic acne after taking this medication. I had very VERY tiny acne occasionally. I mainly went to the doctor for heavy cramps. Now each month I do not suffer from cramps and am very happy.	I was warned birth control can cause mood swings, I did not have any significant ones. Maybe around the time of my period. Also, I gained about 5 pounds after going on the pill, but lost it eventually by upping my exercise and watching closer what I ate. For some reason, I think it's easier to gain weight on this pill, but I don't know if it's just in my head. When I first got on this birth control, I had an intense craving for eggs and ate eggs 3 weeks straight. Again, I don't know if I'm imagining things but I would lose 5 pounds during the sugar pill? Maybe it's because I'm tired all of the time.	I always take the pill at night with lots of water. I am told Yasmin increases the amount of potassium and extra water will flush out the excess. This could be a problem because there's been rumors (not confirmed, but rumors) Yaz might have to be either modified or off the market because of this, according to my doctor. It's expensive, I'm not going to lie. I pay almost 70 bucks per month because I have no insurance.  Make sure you exercise on this pill, because I really think it makes you sluggish easily so you could gain more weight. I've never tried generic.
719	accutane	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Although it's a very powerful/dangerous drug if used while pregnant, or not monitored by your doctor, Accutane really helped my skin. I have tried EVERYTHING! THe benefits were it got rid of all my acne, it shrunk my pores, made my skin less oily, and my hair, smoother skin, brighter skin, even toned. On Accutane i didn't have to wash my hair for 3-4 days. Normally I had to wash my hair everyday because it was so greasy. I would never go without a day of washing when I wasn't on Accutane.	Some of my side effects were really dry lips, sensitive eyes,burning sensation on my face, sensitive skin (if I scratched my hand for example it woulds be sensitive and would scar easily. This time around i had less side effects. The first time on Accutane (10 years ago when I was 16 yrs old) I had bad side effects. I was taking too high of a dose in my opinion 80mg/day. I weighed 100-110 lbs. I had scabbed skin, dry eyes, stomach pain, slight depression, achy body, back pain, joint pain...	FIrst treatment at 16 years old. 2 pills a day of 40mg. With food.  At 26 years old and 105 lbs I took only 1 pill a day that was 40mg. Every month you need to do blood tests to make sure everything is ok. You must be on birth control because being pregnant and on Accutane causes birth defects. Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently. I was lucky enough to not experience serious side effects . In my opinion, if you've tried everything else and nothing worked. Accuntane worked great for me and is a helpful drug.

Seroquel hangover/comedown. Everyday I feel I am sweating all these nasty chemicals out of my skin, I feel weak, fatigued, numb and motionless, I am not climbing the walls of my room anymore, instead I sleep 20hours at a time and when i wake i want to eat everything in my house and go back to sleep. I cant function normally, yes i can be out in society and safe as it takes away my urges, but i feel emotionally numb, i can't cry and at night my legs twitch untill i pass out. Yes i am not trying kill myself, but am i really living like this?	I started off on 25mg daily, mosved up to 150mg night and 100mg morning and now i am on 300mg of the XR Seroquel.
1925	zithromax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	cystic fibrosis	Decreased sputum production and increased lung function.	none	"I take a 2 month course of Zithromax, half a tablet daily, about twice a year to alleviate exacerbations of chronic Pseudomonas Auriginosa chest infection associated with Cystic Fibrosis. It works excellently in conjunction with a 2 week course of nebulised tobramycin (Tobi) to reduce symptoms and decrease sputum production. I believe one of its main actions is its anti inflammatory effect. Also I believe that it inhibits the ability of Pseudomonas to stick to the lungs. This is a great weapon in the arsenal against CF. 

I hope this helps your research and look forward to receiving my Skin Care DIY pack. Thank you."
2460	angeliq	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	menopausal symptoms - hot flashes, sleep disturban	Markedly decreased hot flashes, which allowed for better sleep. Reversal of vaginal atrophy symptoms and vaginal dryness, and the accompanying itching and irritation.	I have not experienced any side effects to date.	According to my doctor, I am one of the small percentage of women who become more symptomatic as time goes by after menopause.  I had stopped hormone replacement therapy after the Women's Health Initiative Study as a result of the negative findings of the Study.  Over a period of several years, I was increasingly bothered by the disturbed sleep resulting from hot flashes and the vaginal discomforts mentioned above, and so reluctantly decided to resume taking hormones.  The doctor stated that Angeliq provided a low dose and that the progestin was closer to that which our body naturally produces. I took it daily for about a year. For the last six months, I have, with the doctor's approval, decreased use from every night to five nights during the week and none on the week-end.  I have not suffered any negative results from the decrease.

3689	effexor-xr	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Helped ease depressed mood, less mood swings. Better overall sense of well being. I was not as emotional and life felt more managable. I didnt even notice its effects while on it. I have tried other antidepressants that made me feel disconnected and my mind was cloudy, also experienced weight gain. Effexor did not make me feel like I was on anything, it just worked in the background. I only noticed it effects once I quit, my emotions were stronger and all my senses seemed intensified.	Bad withdrawels upon quiting medication. Sexual side effects, My senses seemed dulled.	Took 75 mgs once daily for about three months, then wheened myself of it. Very difficult to do, had withdrawels that included nausua, crying, dizzyness, brain felt like it was short circuiting in a way. I had to lay in bed when I didnt take it for 2 days.

3391	coumadin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	dvt	The clots eventually completely dissolved over the course of the treatment.	I had to be careful shaving my legs. I had to pay attention to which foods and alcohol would alter my prothrombin time and make it necessary to take a higher or lower dosage, i. e. be sure to have the guacamole if I indulged in a margarita!	After being diagnosed with thrombophlebitis and deep vein thrombosis twice - once in each leg - the first time through a veinogram and the second time through an ultrasound, I had 11 days in the hospital both times on IV heparin with complete bed rest while my clots which were in the saphenous vein all the way up to the femoral junction, were dissolving.  After my release from the hospital I had 6 months of coumadin therapy.  Through the years I have had sclerotherapy and infrared venous closure procedures. My vein disease has much improved except for capillary bruing/bleeding under the skin which would be considered more of a cosmetic problem, except that it bleeds in one spot that has come to my skin's surface when I bump it,scratch it, or hit it shaving.
2532	lamisil	1	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	toenail fungus	I did not see a change in the condition of the toenail. Only about a quarter if the left great toenail was affected. After taking the drug for the 12 weeks, the physician recommended another 12 week course, however my insurance company would not cover the extended treatment and I could not afford the cost of Lamisil. Perhaps a positive effect would have been realized if I was able to continue the treatment	none	I was to take the drug for 12 weeks after having liver function studies performed. I did not experience any untowards side effects having taken the medication for ther prescribed 12 weeks. I did not miss any doses during that time.
1540	vagifem	1	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	vaginal dryness and urinary tract infections	Using Vagifem for the first 18 months was brilliant. It increased lubrication and stopped the continual urethral soreness I had (and when passing water). It made everything feel normal again.	"During the first 18 months I noticed slight water retention when I used it, and my hot flushes also came back to a lesser degree. 

Then recently I got a new batch of Vagifem, and I had a horrible allergic reaction - dizziness, sinus pain, severe palpitations and panic. My eyes, hands and feet went really puffy and it made my vagina and urinary tract really sore. 

I've since tried another new batch with the same problems. This is so disappointing. I've gone back to an older batch with no problems (except that I've now run out!). 

The manufacturers have changed something, and I wish they would change it back to the original formulation."	25mcg Twice a week
1381	biaxin	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	inner ear infection	There weren't any.  I had to stop taking this medicine after 4 days due to the side effects.	Severe stomach cramping along with frequent visits to the bathroom.  I have had this experience with every type of this medicine: Z-Pack (zithromycin), arithromycin, and now the clarithroymcin.  My doctor said the side effects with the clarithromycin are much less compared to the other types and I found this to be false.  With all the above mentioned medicines, I've always started to get stomach problems on the fourth day.	I stopped taking the medicine after side effects appeared.
125	valtrex	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	cold sores	"Valtrex tablets work by stopping the multiplication of the virus which causes herpes. They can reduce the length and severity of an outbreak of herpes, the duration of pain and shorten the time to healing of crusts associated with herpes. Valtrex tablets help the blisters to heal more quickly. If you start
taking them as soon as you feel an outbreak starting, you may actually
prevent the blisters from developing."	"I did not have any ""observable"" or noticeable side effects while taking Valtrex.  However, I was forewarned that Valtrex has the following side effects:  headache, gastrointestinal discomfort such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea,constipation, abdominal pain,indigestion).  Also because I was taking Valtrex to prevent outbreaks triggered by laser treatments, I was advised that Valtrex causes sensitivity to UV light and my skin would be much more vulnerable to sunburn even during very short exposure to UV light."	I took Valtrex before a laser treatment to prevent the outbreak of cold sores or herpes virus.  The first laser treatment without taking Valtrex caused a herpes/cold sores breakout on my face around the chin area.  After consulting with my physician, he prescribed Valtrex to prevent the outbreaks in future laser treatments.  I learned that the laser triggered the herpes outbreak, since the virus is in a dormant state until it is disturbed and activated by the laser.  I was prescribed 500 mg of Valtrex to be taken 3 days before the treatment, the day of the treatment and three days after the treatment, for a total of seven days.  I took the medication twice a day and started this seven day regime each and every time I had a laser treatment to prevent any outbreaks.

The medicine also regulated the periods and made them on a more regular basis. It also cleared my skin and helped with acne.	The only side effects included breast tendiness and a slight headache during the first 2-3 days of the period. After stopping taking the contraceptive, headaches stopped, too.	I took one pill a day for 28 days, starting on the first day of the period. I tried to take the pill at approximately the same time each day, to improve the effectiveness of the medication.

712	accutane	5	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	cystic acne	The drug cleared my skin and even reduced some of the redness and scarring from the acne.  This was my first and last treatment.	severe sexual side effects began about 2 months into the trial including pain during intercourse, soreness lasting as long as 24 hours followed by periods as long as 2 weeks or more where intercourse was impossible due to intense pain upon penetration, vaginal dryness, and the inability to have a vaginal orgasm.  I also had overall skin dryness, but using a daily moisturizer and medicated chapstick made this very manageable.	treatment began with two 40mg tablets twice a day, but was reduced to once a day after the first month due to extremely dry skin.  When sexual side effects began in month 2, my dermatologist suggested using a personal lubricant during sex (which was never needed before treatment began) and that the problem would clear up once I was finished with the treatment. I began the treatment in Febuary 2007 and finished September 2007.  The problem with dry skin cleared up rapidly, but I continue to struggle with the sexual side effects (as of June 2008).  I have been treating the vaginal dryness with an over the counter product called Replens since January 2008 and this has helped considerably, but it causes constant vaginal discharge. I am now able to have sex about once ever 2-4 weeks, but have yet to experience a vaginal orgasm.

When I have an asthma attack, I use my inhaler to help open my airways and make it easier to breathe. I shake the inhaler vigorously, then prime the inhaler by doing two test sprays into the air. I can then use it by taking two sprays a minute apart, being sure to inhale as deeply as possible.
3087	minocycline	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	acne	I think that the treatment might have improved my acne somewhat, but it always returned.  I stayed on this drug for several years, along with using topical medications.  I was using so many prescriptions that I don't really know which if any of them helped.  I always still had some acne during this treatment.	Chronic yeast infections leading to daily use of nystatin, yogurt, suppliments, etc.  Especially since treatment spanned high school and college years, the effect of having recurring yeast infections was particularly worrisome.  I also did not know when I was prescribed nystatin to deal with the yeast infections from minocycline that the nystatin could have negative long-term effects on my liver.	During my teens, I took minocycline several times a day for many years.  I was also using various topical medications, and at some point, also took different antibiotics such as Bactrim.  Nothing really worked.  I was also trying suppliments, teas, meditation, changes to my diet and exercise routine in order to try to get rid of my acne.  Eventually I wound up using Accutane which also did not work for me.

2740	actonel	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	loss of bone mass	The loss of bone mass retarded. It is difficult to measure the efficacy of the drug apart from a bone scan.  I do not nor have ever broken a bone. Considering my weakness in my wrists this drug may be credited with bone integrity.	Dry mouth, slight constipation,  but rarely any other.  I did not do well with Fosomax, so was given Actonel, and then a once a month Actonel.. My Health Care program persuaded me to take the generic once a week, because it was cheaper.  I find no difference in the once a week or once a month side effects.	Actonel or its generic is taken to stop bone loss- which is especially prevalent in thin white older women. It is a pill taken once a week on an empty stomach upon rising in the morning.  After the pill is taken with an 8 oz glass of water, the patient must remain upright  for 30 minutes. It is a bit of a nuisance not to be able to lie down after taking the pill, and to have wait for 30 minutes before the coffee that is brewing and smells so tantalizing is wafting through the house can be drunk!
220	wellbutrin-xl	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Remarkable improvement in productivity (no down time) and feeling of well-being.	Constipation, sleeplessness	"Treatment started at 150 mg, which showed some improvement

990	armour-thyroid	8	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroid	increased energy (moderate), weight stabilized	none noted	"perimenopausal symptoms initiated this presecription.  Medication benefit seemed small, but just enought to balance me out.  I haven't needed to increase since I started.  Thyroid tests always show me with a ""perfect"" level since I've been taking it.  I'm very drug sensitive and have noticed no side effects.  The only drawback is having to wait 1/2 hour after taking before I can eat each day.  Other than that, it's great - it's even inexpensive to buy!"

None were noticed	The child had this condition for more than 2 years.Her simptoms were quite severe During this time other treatments were administered, but without success. As soon as we started using Elocon the skin improved and after 2-3 weeks it cleared. Eczema didn't go away completely until the child was about 4. As soon as simptoms would reappear Elocon was used, but no more than once or twice at a time. The child is now 5 years old and no eczema on sight, thank God.

570	atenolol	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	supra ventricular tachycardia	I frequently experience heart palpitations at random times for random durations of time. Atenolol has help to suppress these palpitations, so I don't experience them as often. It has drastically reduced the number of episodes I have and also lessens the pounding feeling when the episodes do occur.	I have experienced a few side effects, such as lowered blood pressure. This lead to frequently feeling tired and lethargic. I also get very cold very easily due to low blood pressure. I am also beginning to think that it is effecting my short term memory, but I'm not sure if that's just me. I'm also not anxious anymore. I never suffered from anxiety problems, but I have noticed that I really don't get nervous over anything really!	Overall, Atenolol works to lower my blood pressure, which in turn helps limit my number heart palpitation episodes.
2659	diclofenac	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	mild arthritis in knees	I have mild arthritis in my knees.  I play tennis 3-4 times a week and consistently experienced mild pain and swelling.  I just did not want to give up tennis so I played through the pain.  Within a week after taking Diclofenac, my knees felt like they did when I was 18!!!  It really was amazing and continues.  I litlerally have NO PAIN whatsoever in my knees...	None	I take 100mg 1 X per day.
817	ambien	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	The Ambien did give me a solid nights rest. I did not experience the rapid effect that I've often read about, i.e. that I would fall asleep within 20 minutes even if I was in the middle of an activity. It usually took about 40 minutes to take effect.	After a while I seemed to notice that I was mildly 'groggy' for several hours after waking up. I was working at a garden center at the time and was frequently forgetting where I had left something. The joke was that I had my own private 'lost and found'.	Not sure what this means. I was prescribed this drug for insomnia which could have been menopausal related. I took the drug nightly for approximately two years. About half way thru this time I tried to quit but the insomnia returned so I continued. The second time I successfully quite and have not had a problem since that time.
4137	chantix	8	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	quit smoking	I quit smoking!!!! And so did my husband who was also taking it. I smoked about 1 pack a day and he smoked about 2 packs a day.

I couldn't even keep my head up at work because I was so drowsy. I would have to go lay down in the break room. It got so bad I had to quit taking it. But I decided since it had been 2 weeks smoke free I wouldn't start again just because I couldn't handle the pills. My husband and I have been smoke free for 1 year 2 months!
2414	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	"Prior to taking this medication, I was feeling very tired and ""fuzzy headed"".  I thought these feelings were just due to being overly busy and getting older.  In an annual check-up it was discovered that my thyroid levels were off.  This medication brought my thyroid level to normal. I noticed increased energy and mental clarity within just a few days of starting the medication."	none	After finding through a blood test that my thryoid levels were off, my doctor prescibed this medication for me.

2654	diclofenac	2	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	knee pain/inflamation	Seemed to reduce some every-day pain and inflamation, although I still experienced increased pain and inflamation after physical therapy or increased activity.

After realizing that I was more than just a little upset about my condition, I began to ask questions about the depression.  My pharmacist and I decided I should discontinue and contact my doctor.
707	accutane	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	I had cystic acne, however within the first month i the acne reduced significantly! By the time i was at the 6 month point i had no acne at all. The only down side were the side effects... i felt joint pain, extreme dryness- esp my lips, very dry eyes. I was uncomfortable, however i have been 1 1/2 year without it and i barely get a little zit anymore.	pain, extreme dryness- esp my lips, very dry eyes. There is a great deal of monitoring with this drug... so you really have to be committed to using it (i.e., blood work, frequent dermatology visits, one month waiting period for women to be sure you get on oral birth control, monthly phone questionnaire with the company).	I began the medication at a dose of 30 mg once daily and it was increased to 60 mg... which became the maximum i could handle without significant discomfort.
3592	differin	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	I had acne constantly and would break out a few time a week.  My breakouts have gotten better and only occur occaisionally.	The only side effects I have seen are some dryness on the face.	I use the Differin gel 0.3% on my face and neck every night.  The Differin has helped with the break outs but I do not notice and difference in lines or wrinkles.
261	ultram	1	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	headaches	My pain would subside for several hours. The drug gave me a sense of Euphora which allowed me to deal with the pain better. It gave me a comforting sensation and allowed me to sleep good. My mood changed for the better, almost as if I were high.It actually motivated me to do the things i would normally be too lazy to do. This medication put me in a good mood and a carefree mood.	I would have mild itching	I began taking this medication as prescribed but it put me in such a good mood I began taking more...and needing more. It works great for anxiety also but when I stopped taking it I had the most horrible withdrawls. I could not sleep. My insides felt like they were jumping. I was awfully tired and depressed. I could not keep my arms and legs still when i sat down. It was horrible. I WAS ADDICTED TO THIS MEDICATION AND I STILL AM.  I am still trying to wean off of it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MEDICINE TO ANYONE. Especially if you've had an addiction problem with any other pain meds. BEWARE!!!!!!!!
2860	soma	2	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	broken ribs	The Soma made the patient agitated and did not work. The Flexril made the patient relax and sleep enough to let the rib heal nicely.	The Wellbutrin at times causes confusion in thought transfer.	No Activity for six weeks as patient was a truckdriver for a living and fell in the bathroom at home and broke her rib.  It was floating around and lung puncture was the greatest concern.  The Flexril made the patient relax to almost oblivion therefore disabling her ability to move around.  The Wellbutrin was for bipolar disorder and was taken twice a day for at least a year and prior to that Cymbalta which she said gave her gas.

1097	effexor	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression	There were absolutely NO treatment benefits. I felt worse while on this drug than before I started taking it.	I felt like I had consumed 12,000 cups of coffee. I was anxious, nervous, jittery and irritable. I could not sit still.	I was supposed to start at this dose and then go up to a higher dose after a few weeks. I completely took myself off of this drug since it was not helping me and there was no way I was going to increase my dosage. My doctor never even followed up with me after prescribing this medication...tsk, tsk!!
3787	keflex	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	severe upper respitory tract infection	Mild suppression of the infection, slightly reduced upper respitory tract symptoms, some reduced coughing, some reduced mucus production. The symptoms took at least 5 out of the seven days to begin to dissipate, which is very slow compared to another antibiotic such as Maxamox. Unfortunately the side effects were more noticeable than the treatment benefits, and the prescribing doctor mistook the side effects for another symptom that was not actually present.	Swollen glands, especially in breasts. My breasts became enlarged and very painful, causing my doctor to diagnose pregnancy. Of course this was not the case, as I tested negative for pregnancy, and my doctor was reluctant to believe that the Keflex had anything to do with it. My father noted same side effects after a similar course of Keflex. He developed painful and swollen glands in mouth and neck. Also, the management of the URTI took much longer than with other antibiotics. My symptoms seemed to linger on and on.	I had a severe URTI with bronchial coughing, headache,  muscular and joint pains, and general feeling of fatigue. My doctor presecribed Keflex as an antibiotic, she regarded it as a most effective treatment for this severe URTI. I was to take one tablet (I forget the dosage) once a day for a week to ten days. As I was working I had  no time to rest and had to rely on Panamax to held suppress the symptoms. Unfortunately within a day  my breasts became sore and swollen, and at the end of the week I returned to my GP who tried to diagnose pregnancy when there was not the slightest possibility of this. I finished the course of Keflex, only to take on another antibiotic at the end of the course since the Keflex did such a poor job.
1301	zocor	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	high cholesterol	Did not take it long enough to evaluate the benefits.	After two weeks, moderate muscle and joint pain. I stopped the medicine until all pain was gone, about three days. When I started again, after less than two weeks, I had a terrible reaction.My right shoulder and from my waist down, the pain was so acute that I could not straighten up, nor walk. It was four days, before I started feeling better.	To take 20 mgs a day every day.My total cholesterol is 252, LDL 153, HDL 75

1180	prozac	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety, hopelessness	Anxiety since childhood was relieved.  Felt free to enjoy life and explore opportunities that once would have been declined due to over anxiety and fear of failure or rejection. Have a much more stable emotional balance.	I think there is some detachement from emotions, even positive ones.  There may be no real bottom out lows but there are also no wonderful bright highs.  There may be some effects with sexual attachment on the negative side.	Only the medication is prescribed, no other forms of therapy are being used.  Plan is to stay on medication at this time, due to the percieved stresses of life and fear of going back to what was.
3566	differin	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	acne	my acne calmed down by 75%.still had some break outs when not used on time,but still nothing else would stop the break outs.everything I used just made it worse and mt skin was very dry and inflamed.those problems went away.my skin isn't dry it is back to normal even in the winter when its dry out.	none	used every day after washing face.rubbed in until absorbed,and at night.
1142	aromasin	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	eostrogen-positive breast cancer	During the 4 years so far [out of 5], I have had no recurrance of the tumour and no additional tumours have been detected by ultra-sound, mammogram, and twice-yearly check-ups. Perhaps the greatest benefit is the gradual reduction in stress experienced as a result of my on-going stabilised condition after a lumpectomy.	I had some initial swelling of my hip, knee and ankle joints in the morning which slowly subsided during the day. The medication also aggravated the hot-flushes of the menopause, making them initially frequent and copious, and on-going for the treatment duration so far - tho with reduced frequency now in Year 4. I also experience considerable thirst.	I was put on Aromasin after 6 months on Tamoxifen because I suffered debilitating muscle cramps on Tamoxifen as well as joint problems and extreme hot flushes. Aromasin has been kinder, and so far I have taken it daily for 4 years out of an initial 5. It may be prescribed beyond 5 years, I'm not sure. It has relatively slight side effects now but in the first 6 months I was conscious of its effects on my body - not intolerable by any means, just noticable.
1637	premarin	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	hrt hysterectomy	stopped hot flashes	"breast lumps requiring surgery three times
stroke
cancer requiring surgery, three separate chemo therapies"	My grand mom was prescribed Premarin after her uterus was removed at age 34.  She was a smoker with high blood pressure.  Her doctor was aware of her smoking and blood pressure.   At one point in her hrt therapy she was injecting Premarin per doctors orders.  Now at age 76, grand mom continues to take Premarin because she was told by her doctor that it is the fountain of youth. She is very vain and does not care if this drug kills her as long as she looks young.  She looks and acts older than her actual age.  The risk do not out weigh the benefit.  HRT should only be used to ease a woman into menopause.  Grand mom still has hot flashes after 40 years of HRT.  Had she not taken HRT she would be through menopause and never have suffered the stroke or cancers which took several years of her life away.
721	accutane	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	cleared up acne with first treatment.	Very very dry skin. Lips were chaped and nose was dry. Eyes were a little dry as well.	I was 15/16 years when I was on accutane. It's hard enough being in high school but having acne on top. I tried every acne treatment and my doc finally put me on accutane. It was a savior!! I definitely didn't get depression. If anything it made my life so much easier finishing out high school. I would've loved to have done an extra treament or a lazer treatment after just to take away the small scaring from acne on the balls of my checks. I still get break outs but not to the point that someone would say I have acne. I highly recommend accutane to someone with acne. It was the only thing that worked for me!

1565	lortab	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sever back pain,	Helped some what to control the pain from a disk setting on my siatic nerve. It did not stop the pain but it did help lesson the amount of pain so I could function better.	I think it is more of a long term side affect that happened, In the corse of the years I took this product I started experencing decrease sensation in my lower bowl, to the point I when I needed to use the bathroom, it also messed up my digestion. I quit using it and would only take it when I get so deep in pain I need to get a handle on it, the drug helps then	I was given Loritab to help stop the pain in my back and running down my left leg. I was to take it every 6 hours or as needed, which ended up using it round the clock the pain was so bad. The Doctors also gave me 600mg of Ibuprophin to take with the Loritab. It helped at fist but the end effects to my body I feel in some ways not worth taking the medication, but it it's defense it did help me get a handle on the pain so I could get off the drug
590	acyclovir	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	cold sore	"I was 6 days into having my very first cold sore which had since turned into TWO on the left and right sides of my bottom lip and I had already tried abreva and campho-phenique with absolutely no benefit. I thought I was going to suffer for weeks. It was so painful and kept scabbing then the scabs would fall off after drinking or taking a shower. Then I saw my dr who prescribed Zovirax ointment. I swear, the NEXT day, both cold sores were half the size and no longer ""weeping"". It is just about healed. This stuff works and now that I know I get cold sores, I will never be without Zovirax. Ever."	None	Blotted lips to dry and allow the ointment stay on lips. Wash hands well before and after application. Apply a thin layer to lips 6 x per day and especially right before bed.

1865	augmentin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	subungal hematoma	The medicine was taken to prevent infection since a hole was drilled to drain the gathered blood and release pressure on my nail bed.  As a result, I am in the process of regrowing a healthy nail.	There were no adverse side effects.  By taking the medication and ensuring that the wound was kept clean, infection was kept at bay.	I was prescribed Augmentin at 875mg to be taken twice a day for 10 days in order to fend off infection in my nail bed.  Meanwhile,I used topical iodine and hydrogen peroxide to clean the wound several times a day and applied new bandages at each cleaning.  Once the swelling and pain subsided and growth of a new nail was evident, I trimmed away what I could of the damaged nail to allow the new one space to grow and to aid in keeping the wound clean.

2196	clonazepam	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety	Reduced anxiety, calmness. Prior to using this drug I was not able to function well in my job. I did not want to go out, particularly to crowded areas such as church or shopping. Now I have no problem with going out.	ED, mild energy loss. The ED was the most difficult side effect and I have not consulted my physician about this. My psychiatrist, who issued the drug, does not issue ED medication because he does not have facilities to evaluate my other health needs. Another mild side effect is that if I miss a dose it seems like I have a mild racing heart. Withdrawal symptom. this will occur several hours after a missed dose.	Morning and evening, one tablet, 2 mg. There is a buildup period and until the body has adapted there may be some drowsiness or motor control deficiency. These are gone after a month or so.

Treatment side effects include paresthesia of my hands and mild drowsiness.	Topamax was taken in order to prevent migraines. I also monitored my diet to avoid migraine triggers such as caffeine, aged cheeses, preserved meats, bananas, avocados, beans, dairy products, beer, wine, etc. In addition, I took birth control pills to control hormonal fluctuations. This helped prevent menstrual migraines.
2958	zyban	4	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	smoking	it has done its job and i am smoke free now for 10 weeks	had random dreams for about 1 week,the worst thing was not reading the side effects of drinking alcahol,on one accasion had very little to drink and was verry hung over next day not knowing if someone had spiked my drink, the second time when drinking with mates on the town totally blacked out and have no recolection of 5 to six hours of where i had been or what i had done and sleeping for nearly a day being so tired as though you have not slept for a week	i have stopped taking them now and still not smoking but would warn all to be aware of what the side effects can be its been about 2 week off them now and still feel a bit panicky drowsy at times

3109	ortho-tri-cyclen	7	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	prevent pregnancy	Ortho Tri Cyclen effectively prevented pregnancy, cleared up acne, gave me regular periods, helped with iron deficiency due to blood loss	Thinning hair, bleeding gums, eventually the iron deficiency came back	I began taking Ortho Tri Cyclen at age 20.  It gave me regular periods (they aren't really 'periods,' they are just a withdrawl from the hormones) and less cramping, lighter flow.  It got rid of my acne. I did not get pregnant in my 7.5 years of taking the drug.  I think that eventually the pill prevents you from absorbing nutrients because my iron deficiency came back. I am not sure if the nutrient absorption has anything to do with having bleeding gums more often, but I did have a lot of pain because of a dislodged clot when I got my wisdom teeth removed and the oral surgeon said that this happens more often to women who take birth control. I stopped taking the pill to find more natural ways of birth control, and because my hair was becoming thin and brittle. I also don't like the stories of the effect hormones are having on our environment (going into groundwater).
859	valium	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	Helped greatly in as much as wasnt crying as much and was able to sleep a little better.	only that it made me a bit lethargic but not noticeably so.	Would only take a tablet when I was feeling particularly vulnerable for example at the funeral and times when feeling overcome. I think that this is the best thing about valium you only have to take it when you really need it and it works almost immediately and for me without undesirable side effects. You just have to be careful and not take constantly for long periods of time.I know of many people who have been prescribed the newer anti depressants and have gone through the most horrendous side effects, personally I wouldnt touch them.
2440	wellbutrin-sr	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bi-polar	rid patient of emotional highs and lows.  Bring them to an even mamgeable level.

1748	topamax	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraines	The topamax helped reduce the frequency of the migraines significantly.  In addition, it also helped me to loose weight at the beginning of the treatment.	"With the Topamax, there was nausea at the beginning.  I also have a hard time recalling words and thoughts alot of the time, and I feel fatigued alot.  

The imitrex makes me nauseased and makes you feel wiered after taking it."	Topamax was prescribed due to incresing occurance of migraines.  Dosage started at 50 mg and was increased to 125 until migraines were under control.  Imitrex is taken as need when migraines occur.

Within 2 days the puppy died. He was so weak after metronidazole that he could not move . He was quiet ok before I took him to vet."	Extreme weakness, extreme nausea, the puppy had not taken any food, but he was still vomitting or having anti-peristaltic movements all the time and he died ultimately because of lack of energy.	He was given Metronidazole, Metoclopramide for his nausea and vomiting. I would say the metronidazole may be useful for some but it caused death of my puppy. I am a healthcare professional and I know what metronidazole does.
1796	citalopram	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety, panic attack	I suffered from anxiety for years. My GP prescribed me the Citalopram after I got unfairly dismissed from my job. I didn't feel any difference for 2-3 weeks, then I felt great. I have been enjoying every second of my life since taking this drug.	I would say that the only side effect I found uncomfortable was that the drug made going to the toilet all the time. It gave me diarrhoea sometimes. I think that's to do with the additives	I have been taking 10mg of Citalopram twice a day after food.
2364	propecia	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	thinning hair	After a couple weeks, my hair grew stronger, hairs that were lost along the hairline grew back.  This product really does work	"Not sure if this is related, but I had a pain in my testicle for about 3 weeks straight.  Doctor ruled out hernia and UA came back negative for infections.
I had a small decrease in libido, but it was nothing too serious.  If you like having sex 5 times a day, then this might not be for you.  But, you will still have a normal libido.  Also maybe some fatigue, but again could be related to something else.(stress)"	overall,this is great if you can't stand rogaine.

823	zyrtec-d	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergies	Zyrtec D helped me live almost symptom free every day. Only during the fall when the ragweed count was exceptionally high (my worst allergy by far), did I feel some mild symptoms of allergies. No other medication has so effectively eliminated my symptoms on a consistent basis.	While taking Zyrtec D I often had dry mouth, and just couldn't drink enough water and was occasionally drowsy.	Take one pill every 12 hours, although on more mild days I could get away with only taking one a day.

Bad taste in mouth before falling asleep, sleeping too long (10-14 hours), having difficulty waking up after 8 hours or less.	Due to having depression, Prozac and the anxiety would interfere with sleeping patterns.  I take Lunesta as needed to try to correct my sleeping habits.

1704	retin-a-micro	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne - blackheads and acne scars	Blackheads are gone. Pores on my cheeks are noticeably smaller. Acne scars faded. Skin looks more polished.	A few days a week, my face would be red, very sensitive, and peeling. Then it would be back to normal and then a few days later the peeling starts again.	I use this drug to help with the overall appearance of my skin, especially blackheads, pore size, and acne scars. I don't have any wrinkles, so I can't comment on how well it worked for that. But hopefully it is preventing wrinkles from ever developing. I only use it twice a week now coz my skin is very sensitive. Once I get more used to the drug, I will slowly increase the frequency. During the first two weeks of use, I didn't really notice any changes except that my skin was drier and started to peel a little. By the third week, I started seeing my blackheads disappearing and my pores changing. They actually looked bigger. Then after 2 months of continued usage, my pores got smaller, acne scars faded and blackheads are almost completely gone. Few days a week I would have red, irritated peeling skin. But nothing extremley terrible or intolerable. With good moisturizer and calming face creams, I'm able to minimize my peeling to a point where it doesn't bother me that much. I've heard that Retin-A takes awhile to work and see results, but I've already seen positive changes in less than 6 months. I can't wait to find out the long-term benefits it will have on my skin, especially after I start increasing the frequency and concentration.
455	qvar	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	asthma	The treatment benefits of QVAR are that I do not think about my condition. Also, it is easy to execute the treatment.  I exercise and go about my day as if I were not afflicted with asthma.  I do not worry about having an attack, which is a big relief.  The treatment is inconspicuous, another plus.	I am fortunate in saying that there are no side effects at the dose I am taking.	Each morning, I take out my AeroChamber that holds the QVAR.  I shake the QVAR aerosol canister and place it back into the AeroChamber.  I then empty my lungs of air and take a big puff of the QVAR. I hold it in my lungs for as long as possible before breathing out.  I repeat this process at night before retiring. I expect to be using QVAR for the foreseeable future.
52	flexeril	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	muscle spasms (upper back/neck)	Quick and lasting relief of back and neck pain and muscle spasms. The effects are felt after about 1 hour, and full effects are felt after 1 1/2 hours, and about 80% of the pain and tension are relieved for about 4-6 hours. If stretching of the muscles is done while on the medicine, the pain and tension are greatly reduced for longer than the 4-6 hours. If the medicine is taken before bed, morning pain and tension are reduced about 50%.	Drowsiness (moreso when already tired). If the medicine is taken after 8-10 hours of sleep the drowsiness is manageable. If the medicine is taken after not much sleep, the drowsiness interferes with functioning.	The medicine is taken once per day at night, about 2 hours before bed. Once the medicine fully kicks in (after about 1 1/2 hours), special stretches are done. Stretching along with the medicine provides about 90% relief from pain and tension, and the relief lasts longer than medicine alone. The medicine is also taken as when pain and tension are worse than average.

None. This is not a side effect per se, but it is something to be aware of--the patch leaves a dirty/darkened ring around it on the skin due to normal body oils. Even though I am a heavy shower-taker (but also work out a lot, therefore I produce above average perspiration), no one mentions this but it is unsightly.	Application of one patch in abdomen or upper buttock area weekly.

7. Bad experience for $200!!!"	Hi! I am a russian (european race) who has migrated from Sweden to the USA. I have developed melasma (dark spots) under my eyes and on my forehead. I visited a dermatologist in the USA, FL about 1 month ago. He prescribed me Tri Luma that contains 4% of Hudroquinone. Have you ever read about Hydroquinone?- I asked him. As I investigated it I found the information that hydroquinone has been banned in many european countries including France, Sweden and Russia etc, for concerns about increased cancer risk.The FDA admitted that the risk of using the drug is not known and more testing needs to be done.In fact, the FDA also warned that hydroquinone has been linked to a condition that disfigures the skin. Anyway,I tried the cream, a sample that the doctor gave to me. He prescribed to use it twice a week - Mondays and Fridays. It was terrible!!! I used it just once a week on my pigment spots because my skin got red, burning and after 1 week it was peeling. Some doctors prescribe to use it once, twice a day!!! I put it on only once a week. Ok, after 1 month, 4 treatments I have the result: my pigment spots have not been improved at all. Moreover, the skin is burnt and now I have very obvious dark red-brown spots. I really look terrible. I can't put on any sunscreen because the skin is damaged by Tri Luma. I am so happy that I didn't buy the full size cream which costs $200 and the insurance doesn't cover it. I don't want to buy cancer for $200. Thanks. I've also contacted russian and swedish doctors. They've forbade to use it strongly!!! They've suggested to use natural products such as juice of lemon, parcley, put camomile teabags on dark spots, oatmeal etc... and of course, avoid the Sun. Please be aware, read more information online.

Then, I started getting ulcers on my tongue.  They spread to my gums and inside lips and my tongue was swollen, making it difficult to talk.  I was afraid that if I got stopped, driving, the cop would think I was drunk, because I was slurring my words.  Now, several days after stopping the drug, I still have extreme fatigue. I'm hoping to return to normal!  When I had pneumonia, I actually felt fine, but the cough had to to be treated.  I doubt if I would ever take Ciprofloxacin again."

2045	prempro	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	menopausal symptoms, especially night sweats	Night sweats greatly reduced within a week, from 3-5 strong episodes a night (and associated sleep disturbance) to 0-1 a night (mostly in the early a.m.) and less severe and shorter duration.	Increase in bloating, increased feeling of needing to urinate (every hour or so, but often very little urine production) and quite frequent discomfort, mostly at the end of urination. Tiredness persists, which is odd as I have been sleeping quite a lot better.	My ob-gyn recommended I try this for 3 months, but if the negative effects still persist by the end of the current month I will probably stop taking it.

1092	effexor	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"The effexor worked the first day I took it.  For some time previously, I had felt ""paralyzed,"" or too depressed to get much done.  The day I began taking it, I noticed a difference in that I felt more able to get out of the house, and able to cope with the difficulties of mothering 6 children full-time. As I said, it worked the first day, but continued to work better and better over the next 3 weeks until I worked up to my eventual dose (I started at 37 mg. and worked my way up to 300 mg.)."	The only side effect I noticed was that if, for some reason, I forgot to take the effexor in the morning, by the evening I felt sort of dizzy in a really weird way.	"I'm not clear on what is wanted in this section.  I will do my best, and if you wish to email me with a request for specific info, I will be happy to help.  I was seeing a psychiatrist 9 years ago who thought Effexor was worth a try.  I had been on Prozac a few yrs previous, and although it worked really well, after taking it for two years I developed the side effect of experiencing arthritic pain in my hands.  That was the reason I discontinued the use of Prozac. After being off the Prozac or any other meds for a year or two, I could feel myself sliding back into the black hole of depression and severe anxiety.  I found a doctor (psychiatrist)and he put me on Effexor.  It was a miracle.  I was soooo happy to find something that worked so well, and on the first try. (Several years before, I had gone through what my family refers to as the ""year of hell,"" when I first began the journey of searching for an anti-depressant that would work AND not have side effects that kept me from functioning normally.) My treatment consisted of: Taking the 300 mg of effexor, and monthly visits to my psychiatrist to determine how well my effexor was working and to discuss other treatment options. Although I could notice a marked difference in my mood, I still felt that I wasn't nearly as healthy mentally as I needed to be.  I would still have days when I felt ""paralyzed"" and very anxious.  When I discussed the problem with my psych., he suggested that I add Luvox, another anti-depressant, to my regimen.  That helped as well, although there were two unpleasant side effects: 1) loss of sex drive and difficulty achieving orgasm, and 2) night sweats.  My doc prescribed 1 mg of hytrin for the night sweats; it worked, and he recommended 60 mg. ginko biloba daily for the loss of sex drive.  It may have helped a little, but I was never quite sure. One other thing I found beneficial for my anxiety was 10 mg. dexadrine.  It seemed contradictory to me that a stimulant would calm me down, but the very first day I took it, I felt calm for the first time in my life. Up until then I didn't realize how severe my anxiety was, because I had never known what it was like to be without it. But that very first day I took it, I felt a calmness come over me that was such a relief.  Always before, I had a feeling inside that I can only explain as the feeling one would get if one was late for an important meeting with one's boss.  Sort of like, ""I'm late! Gotta hurry! oh, no!""  That was a feeling that I had always had, and it had nothing to do with what my situation was-- late or early, it made no difference.  For the first two weeks I took the Dexadrine, I didn't pull my hair (trichotillomania)at all, nor did I even realize I wasn't pulling, as I didn't even think about it.  Unfortunately, I did go back to pulling after that. The 2 side effects I experienced with the dex. is that 1) it made me drowsy for about the first hour after I took it, and 2) it made me feel like I lost my spontaneity.  I got a lot more done, and I didn't feel so panicked, but I wasn't as much fun.  For that reason, I stopped taking it regularly and took it maybe only half of the time.  After maybe a year or two I quit taking it altogether and when I went back on it last year after having been off of it for about 5 years, it no longer worked as it had before.  It made me feel jittery as though I'd had way too much coffee.  It just made the anxiety worse.

I'm not sure if I was supposed to tell about more than one medication for this survey. However, these four meds I've mentioned were all sort of intertwined, so it seemed appropriate for me to do so. I have taken a myriad of other anti-depressants in my quest to find one that would work, and I would be willing to share my experiences with those other meds as well. Just let me know if you want mori info."

My mood, energy and hormonal balance remain constant, particularly compared to other pills but unfortunately so has my sex drive.  The changes in sexual feelings are clearly related to the pill because as soon as I take the placebos I experience a huge elevation in sex drive.  That is not much motivation to keep taking them but aside from spermicidal barrier methods that cause irritation and invasive procedures such as the IUD, I don't know what other options I have.

This being said, it does provide some mental relief from chronic pain. and it relieves some of the muscle stiffness.	When I do not take this medicine it puts me in a bad mood and causes my stomach to ache (like bad hunger pains even though I am not hungry). After I take the medicine these symptions disappear.

My hands looked worse than anyone else's my age (or older!).  My hands now looks pretty good/very good!	As the age spots scabbed up, they peeled off, and left my hands red, raw and sore.  One night, the burning feeling was so intense, I had to wash it off.  I was quite worried, as this medicine was out of date, and I thought perhaps it had become dangerous.  Originally it was prescribed for my daughter's acne, but I had read online that it might be helpful for age spots.	I applied a small amount, probably more than I needed to, to the back of each hand for several nights in a row.  Before many nights had passed, I noticed that the skin around each age spot was beginning to become dry and peeling.  Before long, the age spots just seemed to peel off, as did some spots that were more like small moles or very dark freckles.  Although I was concerned that I had severly burned and scarred my hands (they looked very bad for more than a month), now they look great.  In fact, the left one, which was the worse one, improved more than the right hand!

Not willing to avoid spicey foods my physician prescribed ranitidine. I recall he intially prescribed 150mg twice daily. At one point he recommended 300mg twice aday. But 150mg twice daily is working. The dosage reduced the occurence of heartburn (my symptoms)to near zero."	I am not aware of any side effects. However that does not mean I have not experienced any. I think headaches are a side effect and I get them occasionally, but I cannot tie it to the medication. In any case I do not experience any kind of debilitating medical problems or even annoying ones that I can link to taking ranitidine.	"I take a 150mg tablet in the morning before or during breakfast and then another at lunch. This combination prevents heartburn throughout the day. Late night dinners may produce heartburn, often I'll take a tablet prior or immediately after as prevention. Also I elevated my bed about 2"" at the head to prevent what had been fairly frequent events of stomach acid somehow working its way into my mouth at night. This drug and the elevated bed has reduced this to a very rare occurence, and again often associated with late evening meals if I do not take a tablet in the evening."
3924	nexium	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	gerd (gastroesophogeal reflux disease)	I had suffered from daily acid reflux for approximately 4 or 5 months. Sometimes the reflux was so severe that I could not sleep. I changed my diet and tried many drugs, including ranitidine, Prilosec and Pepcid AC--none of whic helped. Although Nexium is very similar to Prilosec in its formulation, for some reason Nexium allowed my esophageal lining to heal and after a one month treatment, my heartburn is much better as long as I continue to watch my diet.	With Prilosec, I occasionally had stomach cramping and nausea, but I did not experience any side effects with Nexium.	I took 1 capsule (40 MG) of Nexium daily for 30 days. Because my heartburn was typically worse in the evenings and at night, I took it in the late afternoon about 45 minutes prior to dinner. After one month, the improvements have been quite noticeable and I have been able to switch back to less powerful, over-the-counter medications.

I developed severe itching (mostly in the legs and back, some in the neck area) and severe bruising as a result of trying to relieve the itch. The itching, hives and bruising dissipated about 2-4 weeks after final dose.
318	ativan	5	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	inability to fall asleep	I was able to fall asleep and stay asleep.	None, until recently. I began having severe anxiety/panic attacks. I stopped the Lorazepam in order to determine the culprit, if any. No panic attacks since stopping the drug. Seems strange since this is the drug of choice for panic attacks.	Lorazepam was prescribed inability to fall asleep. Also, if needed during the day for anxiety. I never took it during the day for anxiety, only at night to aid in sleep. I have stopped taking it and have not had a panic attack in 2 days.
2012	sonata	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia	Fell asleep easily without feeling drugged the next day.	None, but the drug didn't last long.

I was able to get myself into a good sleep pattern without any drug dependence.

581	acyclovir	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	cold sores	My whole lip used to swell up and I would get over a dozen little pockets of fluid that would merge into one giant blister. Now, cold sores appear 1/2 as often as before - down to every other month at most. One or two little pockets of fluid usually appear without the unsightly swelling. The cold sore is dried up within 24 hrs. They became unnoticeable to everyone.	I had to take it with food or I would get a little upset stomach.	I have been taking Acyclovir daily for 1 year so far and will continue as long as my doctor allows me to.
631	nortriptyline	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	severe depression	Mood lifted considerably. Able to live life again. Life is much lighter. I am no longer oversensitive, things like life's little injustices don't hurt so much anymore. My daily experiences in this initial period can be followed on: http://nortriptyline.blogspot.com/ where I am keeping a diary. This is for the benefit of others who are indecisive and want to know more details before embarking on a course of medication themselves with nortriptyline.	So far all the side effects seem temporary. Cold hands/feet, white face. Bad taste in mouth. Fuzzy in the beginning. Nothing serious so far.	So far the treatment is only to take one tablet a day, and occasionally an Oxazepam in the first two weeks, if I am afraid of falling back into a depression. I started taking both for the first three days, but will soon leave off the Oxazepam. We'll see what happens, it can be followed on my above-mentioned blog. In any case so far I am happy I am taking this medication, I feel much better. I was severely depressed when I started taking it, but the depression seems quite suppressed now.
3808	cialis	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	erectile dysfunction	Hard, sustained erections. Penetration is not a problem and there's no longer any concern about losing an erection too soon.  Lasting longer seems to result in more intense orgasms.	Mild back and muscle aches, nasal congestion and some facial flushing.

2619	miralax	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	irritable bowel syndrome	Helped ease constipation without causing discomfort. I have tried many different types of laxatives, fibers, etc to help reduce my problems with constipation. Many laxatives cause extreme cramping and work only the one time. The next day, the problem returns. With Miralax, I took it for the three consecutive days and it worked slowly, but without cramping, and without and discomfort at all. The effects lasted for several weeks -- that is, I had a bowel movement every day, easily. After about three weeks I needed to take it again, but it was only for the three days and then it had the same effect. I have been doing this now for almost a year. I feel significantly better.	None	"I take Miralax in the evening, mixing it with a cup of warm water. After about three days, it starts to work. It does not ""clean out"" my stomach -- just helps me to have easy and regular bowel movements. I have to repeat the three-day program every three weeks or so. When I notice I have not had a bowel movement for a few days, then I take it again. For me, this is a great help."
48	clarinex	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	allergy induced asthma	We tried various allergy medicines including zyrtec, but my son continued to have re-occurring sinuses infections and chronic nasal congestion.  Then we tried clarinex.  This past winter, we were sinuses infection free. The clarinex also cleared up the chronic nasal congestion.  It also helps that he likes the taste of the medicine.	None, or at least he never complained about any.	Zachary receives 1 tablespoon of clarinex daily.
1850	augmentin	4	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	sinusitis	Treatment quickly eliminated discomfort associated with the sinus infection.  These included ear ache, sore throat, and fever.  These symptoms were partially alleviated within 24 hours of the first dose.  Within 48 hours, all symptoms were no longer present.  However, the eliminated symptoms associated with the sinus infection were almost immediately replaced by negative side effects.	The treatment caused numerous side effects.  These included severe stomach cramping and nausea, a severe yeast infection, vomiting, diarrhea and chills.  These side effects began within approximately twelve to twenty four hours after first dose of augmentin was administered.  These side effects were intolerable and somewhat worse than the symptoms from the initial infection.	Augmentin was administered at a dosage of 500 mg to be taken two times a day.  Total treatment time was to be 10 days, but within 24 hours, the side effects of the antibiotic were so intolerable that, after 3 days, the drug was terminated and a different antibiotic was administered.

For a while was on higher dose of topomax at 100 mg but seem to experience some memory issues but did not have any further issue with this once the dose was reduced.	This was an off label use of topomax which was under the supervision of my doctor who saw me regularly for diabetes.  It was important to lose weight to improve the diabetic condition.  It was supportive in helping me maintain the discipline of the diet program that the doctor also recommended so that with the combined approach I succeeded in losing 52 pounds in a slow, healthy manner.

223	wellbutrin-xl	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anti-depressant	The biggest benefit was when I quit smoking, because I had been taking it for a while...it proved to assist with the cravings...it's probably why I was able to quit in the first place.	Made me kind of grumpy and a little weight gain.	Started taking anti-depressant when my Mother passed away.  Started a low-dose and increased over a period of 3 months.

2806	wellbutrin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"The drug worked on reducing/eliminating my situational feelings of depression.  Initially, it increased my energy and focus, and stopped the feelings of sadness.  It did not make me feel like a ""zombie"" and I felt connected to my emotions and the people around me, which I had heard was a side effect of other anti-depressants."	At first I had crazy dreams, whch wasn't so bad.  I did not have any trouble falling asleep.  I had very high energy for the first 2 weeks, then it tapered off back to normal.  I wish the energy had remained.  I did not lose any weight, which I was hoping for...but I did not gain any either, so that was positive.	I started on 150 mg for 2 weeks on the brand name drug once a day.  It seemed like as soon as I was switched to the generic 300mg, the energy and focus benefits stopped.  There is no way to know if it was the switch to generic or just my body getting used to the drug, but it was dissapointing.  I really enjoyed the energy.  I weaned myself off after 1 year because I didn't need it anymore.  I did not have any significant withdrawal symptoms.  Overall it was a positive experience, although I was glad to not need it anymore.
587	acyclovir	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	cold sores/fever blisters	It is very effective, especially if you take it early enough. But even if you wait till the cold sore is larger, it still stops the growth of cold sores completely, and helps to heal pretty quick. id say within 2-3 days. Its so worth it if you are like me, and get cold sores ALLLLL the time. (at LEAST 10 times a year, no joke) I have to have the medicine with me at all times. The sad thing is, I'm only allowed 4 refills a year, so I have to lower my dosage, but, it still works.	spotting/cramping between periods, which didnt happen till I started taking this medicine.	I take 3 per day for about 2- 3 days on the onset of a cold sore. I recommend you use as directed, also be sure to drink PLENTY of liquids (no alcohol) while taking the medicine. Also, be sure you arent on any other medications that effect your kidneys, liver, or stomach. Also, only take it on the ONSET of a cold sore. Not every day for the rest of your life.
3511	minoxidil	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hair loss	Regained hair growth. Minoxidil first increased hairloss (normal during the first weeks of using).

The genitofemoral nerve was stitched into and i was left suffering from a combination of abdominal pain like appendicitis, and sharp pain when moving my right leg. Eleven months later, and i was still breathless with pain, and could not walk without twisting my body to guard it. 
i was offered gabapentin, but was swollen within 24 hours, and only managed to move my bowels three times in eight weeks - not good when the reason all this stated was a rectocele caused by megacolon.
When i withdrew i became suicidal, absolutely despairing, for three weeks. Two months on, my weight gain has not come down, and the palpitations are if anything worse. Not my sort of drug."
1242	sotret	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Smooth, clear skin.  The Roaccutane not only got rid of my acne but also rejuvenated my skin.  Pores were finer, blackheads were gone.	Dry lips, red skin for the first month or so.	Treatment consisted of orally taking two tablets a day.  I was prescribed Cetaphil lotion and lip balm to keep side effects at bay. Roaccutane was an excellent treatment.  Before going on it I spent hundreds of dollars on other anti-acne treatments such as Clearasil etc and had no joy.  Don't waste your money on other treatments just see your GP and ask for Roaccutane if you have an ongoing acne problem.
1658	evoclin	5	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	acne	The acne cleared up but the evoclin was used in combination with proactiv.  Proactiv was used before and then started getting acne again.

Started 4 years ago with a 100 mgr dose and after 2 years of daily use changed to 88 mgr due to a positive effect of the drug. Besides taking levothyroxine, the patient is also practicing yoga exercises that stimulate thyroid gland.
1610	avage	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	to achieve a smoother skin surface	Very effective in obtaining a mild peel, to slough off dead skin cells, every 15 days or so.	Using it for more than 3 days at a stretch caused excessive peeling, which was visible even under makeup. Redness and rawness was also present. A break of a few days was required before restarting the treatment.	Tazarotene cream was applied to the face at bedtime and washed off in the morning
968	sarafem	3	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety	I did not find any benefit really.  In fact it seemed to make me more anxious.	Anxiety	I was prescribed this because of anxiety and mild depression by my GP but it did not improve my condition and seemed to make my anxiety worse.  My anxiety was partly due to my personality and partly due to the fact that I had a mentally ill son which caused me a lot of worry and stress.   My GP thought that SSRI's may help and prescribed fluoxetine.   This did not help and he changed me to Cipramil which suited me better as it did not make my anxiety worse but it did not really help my anxiety that much so I stopped taking this as well.

2359	propecia	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	male pattern baldness	Ostensibly this product will prevent further hair loss. While the initial male pattern baldness is mild, I fear worsening of the condition, and am taking this as a preventive measure.	I experienced sharp bursts of pain in the top rear left quadrant of my head intermittently for about seventy-two hours of commencing treatment. These subsided and may or may not be related to the medication.	I began taking the product to stave off the onset of male pattern baldness. As the treatment is said to show full effects in two years, my four-week course is probably not enough to show results. I will report again in due time.

1697	retin-a-micro	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sun damage to face	"The prescription recommended that I use the gel every night, but this became too drying on my skin.  I alternate one night of Retin-A, 1 night of Stri-Vectin.  The Retin-A causes my face to peel, so exfoliating frequently is necessary so that I don't look as if my face has dandruff.  I use a Clarisonic for cleansing; it has been wonderful.  I have also used Benefit's ""Bluff Dust"" to cover the redness that the Retin-A gel causes, and continue to use Noritate for my rosacea.  The Retin-A is very effective, but also quite expensive.  I have found a pharmacy in Canada where I can order it online for less than 50% the US price.  I hope this doesn't make me sound unpatriotic!  I have always taken good care of my skin, and have no big wrinkles or droops --except for those lines between my eyebrows, because I am a committed scowler.  I do not believe that Retin-A would be as effective on skin that has already developed a good deal of sagging, but this is my personal opinion and is based only on my own experience."	"Some of the information in this and the following paragraph will be redundant because when I started writing a response to the first question, I didn't see what was to follow.  The Retin-A gel dried my skin and caused it to peel.  For this reason, I used it every other day instead of every day. I alternate with Stri-Vectin.  I also need to exfoliate frequently or my face looks frightening!
When exfoliated and moisturized, my skin looks wonderful.  I have used Benefit Cosmetics' ""Bluff Puff"" to tone down the redness; I have stopped using any kind of makeup base if my face is shedding because foundation doesn't tolerate pieces of peeling skin very well.  However, my complexion looks great without makeup.  I still use mascara and liner and shadow."	"Before going to bed, I wash my face with the Clarisonic brush.  I love it!
When my face is clean and dry, I apply a pea-sized amount of Retin-A gel all over my face and neck.  I do not avoid the eye area, but I do wash the gel off my eyebrows with a q-tip and water so that the skin under my eyebrows doesn't peel.  I also put Talika Lipocils on my eyelashes.  
In the morning I wash my face, exfoliating every couple of days to rid the skin surface of drying flakes.  Then I moisturize with shea butter or almond oil or even extra-virgin olive oil.  This does not make my face oily; my skin drinks up the oil and looks good.  
The following night I wash my face and when it is clean and dry, I apply Stri-Vectin.  I alternate so that one night I use Retin-A and the next night I use Stri-Vectin or another moisturizer.  I don't think I will be buying any more Stri-Vectin because I am doubtful of its effectiveness and because I would prefer to make my own product.  I know that I will be unable to make Retin-A gel, but making other products for my own use is very attractive to me."
286	panixine-disperdose	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	skin infection	My skin became infected from scratching too much and too hard when I had an allergic reaction to a topical skin product.  A day after I started taking the medication, I noticed a decrease in the redness and swelling of the affected skin.  I was prescribed zyrtec in conjunction with the antibiotic but it causes severe drowsiness.  My doctor had me discontinue the zyrtec and see how I did with the cephalexin alone.  I continued to heal faster than I think I would have without the medication.	I had no side effects	Take 1 capsule three times per day for 14 days.

MADE MY LIFE LIVABLE AGAIN.  I'M THANKFUL THAT I HUNG IN THROUGH THE SIDE EFFECTS OF CYMBALATA.  IT TOOK OVER A YEAR TO FIND THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF DRUGS AND I'M THANKFUL THAT FINALLY DID.

THE EXCESS DREAMING FINALLY STOPPED AND THE COMBINATION OF THE 2 DRUGS HAS BEEN WORKING MIRACLES FOR ME EVER SINCE.  MOST PEOPLE GIVE UP ON CYMBALTA BUT I WAS DESPARATE.  MOST OF THE SIDE EFFECTS DO GO AWAY AS I SAID IN ABOUT 2 WEEKS EXCEPT FOR THE DREAMING.	NO DETAILS REALLY, JUST TAKE PILLS AS PRESCRIBED, TRAMADOL 2 A DAY AND CYMBALATA 2 A DAY. I CAN ADD A TRAMADOL IF I AM HAVING A FLAREUP.  I'M LEADING A PRETTY NORMAL LIFE.  I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH ENERGY AS I WOULD LIKE BUT I SURE HAVE A LOT LESS PAIN.
3092	minocycline	3	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	There was little to no benefit from taking the medication. Acne did not visibly improve over the entire course of medication.

I eat one fish fillet or chicken breast/day, nothing else, now gaining 3-6 lbs./month!  Since I can't find a Dr. who will treat my T3 I'm ordering Cytomel online, from what I've read it's the ticket to eliminate hypo symptoms.  Shame on physicians who treat lab results rather than the patient.  I don't care what the numbers are, I still feel awful!	FAT	Doesn't work!  It's the T3!
1892	doxycycline	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	cat bite	I have tried various alternatives to penicillin and this has been the best. I had a nasty cat bite (a tooth stuck in my bone, so it was deep). I was told I was highly likely to get a a deep and painful infection given the depth of the bite. So I was warned to take all of these or I'd be back later for IV treatment and it would be a far longer course. Well, I took 8 of the 10 days prescribed and not only did I never get an infection, I had few side effects. There was, perhaps, a slight stomach upset but not even enough to need what I standardly use -- yogurt. I'd recommend this to those who need a penicillin replacement.	slight nausea - hardly noticeable	I took the Doxycycline for 8 of the ten days prescribed, taking two pills per day.

The side effects began about 7-10 days after starting the Asacol. The nausea and vomiting was not immediately associated with Asacol but was attributed to possibly having the flu.  It was only until his urine became a brownish purple color that we thought it must be the Asacol and immediately stopped it.  Symptoms went away when stopped.
97	pristiq	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	add & anxiety	Immediate relielf from anxiety.....even better after a couple of weeks.  May focus is better on this drug than all the years (about 15) I have been treated for ADD.	None as long as you don't miss any doses.  Missing more than one dose results in vertigo.  I'm sure there are very unpleasant withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it.	"I was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder in my early 30's.  I tried different treatments...ritalin (terrible side effects), adderall (didn't work well alone), Adderall with Effexor (Worked great but is hell on your sex life) and then Adderall with Wellbutrin.  I took the Adderall with Welbutrin for 10 years but had to take ambien to sleep. Heart palpatations are another side effect of that combo.  

Menepause hit a couple of years ago and nothing seemed to work well and I developed major anxiety issues.  I started on Estrogen replacement and then asked my Dr what we could try that was closer to the Effexor I tried years ago.  That's when we tried Pristiq.  He seemed amazed at the results.  I do not need a ""drug cocktail"" anymore....I felt like Elvis for years.  I love my life again!"

72	flexeril	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	tension in jaw and bruxism (grinding of teeth)	I woke up with a more relaxed jaw. I have bruxism which is the medical term for the grinding of teeth or the clenching of jaws. So if I have alot of tension in my jaw before I go to bed I will grind my teeth which will lead to migraines. Taking Cyclobenzaprine(Flexeril) before I go to bed helps me avoid waking up in pain due to Bruxism.	I have only had one side effect due to mixing Cyclobenzaprine(Flexeril) with Maxalt which lead to being fatigue and drowsiness.	"It has been only 1 week of taking Cyclobenzaprine so I may experience different side effects the more I take it. So far this medication has worked for me. I did notice one very positive benefit from taking this medication this 1 week. I started this medication around the same time I start to get PMS symptoms ""Mainly very moody and argumentative"" and I'm amazed how Cyclobenzaprine effected my PMS symptoms. I have absolutely been the most pleasant person to be around.  It feels great to be myself and not angry at everything."
3939	sular	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	My blood pressure was out of control. My doctors had prescribed diuretics (limited effectiveness) and other forms of calcium channel blockers. This in my opinion is a wonder drug!My blood pressure had shot up so badly that I would get nosebleeds when working on my knees or bending over.My pressure was in the triple digits at times.	None whatsoever	Once daily generally in the morning with a light breakfast
3701	effexor-xr	2	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression, axiety	Having taken a four other drugs for depression over the last 15 years (all of the SSRI category) or so, and I can say without doubt that this drug was amazing as removing my depression, as well as substantially reducing remaining anxiety left over.	It almost immediately raised my diastolic and systolic blood pressure my 20 and 35 points respectively (up to about 105/170), as well as elevating my heart rate from 75 beats per minute to 95-100 beats. I occasionally experienced difficulty reaching orgasm in the course of sexual activity, but did not experience reduced sex drive or difficulty attaining a full erection (I'm honestly not sure whether to rate this as a side effect or a benefit).	"The benefits of Effexor XR were terrific. The side effects while taking it were just fine with me, though my psychiatrist seemed alarmed about my heart rate and blood pressure. That said, the withdrawal was so atrociously horrible it simply wasn't worth taking. I would have rather taken a drug that was half as effective without this uniquely gross withdrawal. Let me put this into perspective: I've gone through nicotine, alcohol, and speed withdrawal (the last a long time ago) and the Effexor was the worst (and I required hospitalization for the alcohol). It took me between three and four months to taper off the drug. I tried to stop --unsuccessfully--at 75% the regular dose, then 50%, and then 25% before deciding to just taper it down to a dose so small I had a hard time believing it had any psychoactive effects at all. Even finally quitting taking the drug at all when I'd tapered down to 1/15th the initial dose, I experienced mild versions of the same awful withdrawal issues that had popped up before: intermittent (intense!) nausea (previously full blown vomiting on previous quitting attempts), night sweats, what I've read in Effexor forums described-inadequately-as ""brain shivers,"" though-- amusingly enough-- very little of the depression or anxiety rebound past the first few days of 0 mg. If I were at suicidal or bed-ridden level of depression this drug would be completely worth it, even with the withdrawal. Otherwise, I'm staying away from SSNRI's for a long time."

I encountered no physical side effects, however I did have trouble with insomnia after I discontinued the treatment.

Initially I had a bit of nausea and extreme sleepiness the first week, but then that subsided and everything was great for a month.

As a former drug addict, I flat refused anything that would be addictive. ie diazepam, tamazepam, etc. My doctor suggested buspar as it was not addictive, and yet had similar effects to diazepam. He prescribed it on a prn basis, and i was sceptical. However, within 20 minutes of taking it, the effects were astounding. Anxiety subsided, and a feeling of warmness enveloped me. One dose lasted about 5 hours, and did not inhibit any other aspect of my day to day activites. It also helped with my disrupted sleep patterns.	Dry mouth after taking, and slight feelings of lethargy, but hardly noticeable.	Its meant to be used as a short term treatment for anxiety, no more than 3 months.

930	mevacor	2	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	originally brain lesions then lower cholesterol	I believe the treatment at the lower 10 mg dose was effective in reducing the serverity of my brain lesions. I also believe I was thinking more clearly afterwards than I was prior to starting on lovastatin. A brain MRI taken a year after starting on Lovastatin indicated the lesions had reduced a bit, but that was not confirmed by my doctor as my previous MRI had been lost when I changed doctors.	After increasing the dosage to 20 mgs to also reduce my cholesterol levels, I started to experience extreme pain in my arm muscles.	"Originally I started taking it to see if it would have any positive effect on the number and size of brain lesions I had. I had experienced an increasing inability to handle job stress, was losing my concentration abilities and was becoming increasingly forgetful. I believe it did have some positive effect in reducing the size and number of brain lesions, but not to the effect of improving my cognitive thinking ability to the extent I could return to work. Two years later, my doctor wanted me to increase the dosage to reduce my cholesterol levels.  Shortly after increasing my dosage, I started to experience chronic pain in my arms.  I finally did some research and discovered muscle pain to be a ""side effect"" when taking statin drugs.  When I stopped taking Lovastatin, the pain went away after a few months."
3041	seroquel	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	insomnia	As a caregiver, I did not see any benefits, the patient continued to have problems with insomnia	The side effects of this medication in combination with the patient's medical condition and current medications were tremendous and in my opinion contributed to the patient's death.  The patient started having delusions as well as other bizarre behavior and the family could not convince the patient otherwise.  The patient was also on renexa which is known to be a strong inhibitor and I believe caused the seroquel to attain toxic blood levels.  The family tried to contact the psychiatrist to discuss the problems but before this occurred, the patient went into v-fib miles from a hospital.  It was more than 20 minutes before the life saving crew arrived at the scene and even longer before the patient arrived to the ER for treatment.  The patient was pronounced dead on the scene.	The patient was referred to the psychiatrist by his cardiologist secondary to depression and increasing insomnia.  The patient had been on welbutrin for years for depression and smoking cessation.  The psychiatrist kept the patient on welbutrin and added xanax for anxiety and seroquel for sleep at bedtime.  Slowly the family started noticing strange behavior, delusions, and almost dementia type characteristics in the patient that occured over a 4 month period and began to get more severe.  The family attempted to talk about the changes with the patient but as true delusional behavior dictates, the patient was unable to see any of the changes.  The forgetfulness, clumsiness, and personality changes such as irritability increased.  The family attempted to contact the psychiatrist but in interim, the patient died of a cardiac arrest.  Even after talking to the psychiatrist after the patient's death, the psychiatrist denied that seroquel had any affect on the situation.  The family and myself as the primary caretaker believe that seroquel was directly responsible for the patient's death.  We do not plan to seek legal retribution but hope that anyone that reads this will be more cautious about prescribing seroquel in someone that already has cardiac problems and to please be careful about it's possible interactions with other medications!

She put me on 10mg first.After 3-4 weeks I went back and asked for her to increase it. She prescribed 20mg,(which I found they don't make 20mg doses) Instead of changing it to a proper mg, she decided to have me take 2 10mg pills every morning which also doubled the cost and that amount was not enough to have much benefit. After about a year , I was finally prescribed a therapeutic dosage of 40mg. I had too many problems with the pharmacy ordering the right amount ( they had me take 4 10mg pills a day because they didn't order the right ones! I have no health insurance so was getting it on some program that made it cost me $6 but when they would screw up the order , I would either run out or have to get the full amount which was $130.00 at the 10mgs, so X 2 for 20mg, x 4 for 40mgs!! Just because of the way the pharmacy was doing it.Scamming the federal programs or  something...so I finally just quit taking it. I definately had noticed that it made pee without barely any warning, and my eyesight got alot worse, and my fiance said it made me ""mean"". All that has stopped now that I am not on it.

344	neurontin	5	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	degenerative disc disorder, spinal stenosis l1-s1	Ability to sleep 8 full hours without waking up in pain was fantastic!  No need to get up during night to void, also fantastic.	Excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating and retaining information, craving sweets which worsen my hypoglycemia, among others.	Initial 300mg was taken for only 2 days, due to severe daytime sleepiness in AM.  Found it nearly impossible to drag myself out of bed in am.  My morphine controlled release wears off within 8-9 hours, so staying in bed NOT advisable without another dose of morphine or Percocet, but the neurontin makes me want to keep sleeping.  When I finally do wake up, minimally after 11 hours after I fell asleep, I still felt tired, and now in a lot of back, hip and sometimes even knee pain, from laying in bed motionless for so long, on L side of body.  Because of the sleepiness side effect, I do not take any during day. Since my MD would not lower dosage from 300mg until next monthly visit, I bought empty size 0 gel capsules at local health food store, and painstakingly divided the dosage from the 300mg capsules into 2 150mg capsules.  Initially, this seemed to be a good solution.  I was able to continue having 8h of pain-free sleep, and getting up after 8h was easier.   But, after only 4 days at the lower 150mg dosage, the excessive sleepiness after 8h of normal sleep continued, so I need to try cutting down the dosage even more.  Have to take the dextroamphetamine controlled release, to fully wake me up in AM, and once that wore off after 12 hours in early evening, I am too tired to study for my classes.  Overall, I would recommend this drug only for adults who do not have to drive to work, or adults who can take naps during work hours, or adults who are not trying to taking classes for credit.  I am hoping the upcoming RFA procedure will allow me to stop taking the narcotics and neurontin, and allow me to be able to work, study and retain what I learn in class (especially short term memory).

I was like a week to eliminate it from my body and have to take another prescription for the rash, an anthistaminic or antialergic.	Just take the pills every 8 hours to tame the pain because of the root canal procedure that was done partially, not totally because of the inflamatory process.

It is an antidepressant but used in this case to break a cycle of tension headaches. The pattern of tension headaches was broken and the headaches have not since returned. It also acted as a migraine headache preventative.	It does cause drowsiness and so had to be taken at night. It also causes a dry mouth. It felt to me as if it were also slowing my metabolism down but this was not measurable in the time frame.	One tablet per night for three months.

2636	toradol	3	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pain relief after surgery	I took this drug for pain relief due to surgery (laproscopically assisted hysterectomy). Although the pain I experienced wasn't great the drug did relieve it but the side effects were not worth it.	It's hard to know as I was swollen from the surgery but the drug's listed side effects are swelling if the torso, thighs, and legs. I was very swollen when I left the hospital and it didn't dissapate.	I was given the drug intravenously while in the hospital and a perscription when I went home. I was swollen from my breasts to my toes and attributed this to the surgery.I had told my doctor that I couldn't tolerate a high does of ibuprofen so she prescribed the generic toradol as pain relief. When the swelling showed no signs of abating, I looked up the drug's side effects and saw that swelling of the torso, thighs and legs was listed. I was trying to reduce the swelling so I stopped taking it and switched to 1 ibuprofen 4 times a day. That relieved the pain and the swelling immediately started to go down. When I told my doctor she said swelling of the torso was not a normal effect of the surgery. I conclude that the drug was at fault.

My doctor told me i would probably still get my period around those times, just very light. However i did not get any spotting for three months, i got my period a week ago and it's getting worse. The cramps on a scale of 1 to 10 are at 11, and it went from very light to heavy. I'm not even at the end of the pack yet! I don't recommend seasonique. I was told to take motrin, that hasn't even helped. I've felt like i'm in labor for a week now.	I was actually rushed to the hospital last night because the cramps were so severe. All day i felt a little pain now and then, however towards the end of the day it got unbearable. I was sitting in the air conditioning and i started to feel really hot out of nowhere, had difficulty breathing, nausea, and felt like i was literally about to faint.

2185	clonazepam	5	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	agoraphobia, panic disorder	"Taking the rivotril made me sleepy at first but then it just calmed me down enough to be able to cope with life.  I was constantly anxious and scared and the rivotril made it possible for me to come down to relatively normal anxiety levels in ""safe"" situations, whereas before I didn't have any situations I considered safe.  It helped me sleep and made me feel more rested and in control.  I got pregnant while taking it (I had been trying for 18 years) and I honestly believe that being more relaxed helped me not only to get pregnant but to carry the baby as I had had four miscarraiges previously.  I started confronting situations that were uncomfortable to me before and was able to live a reasonably normal life, even though I have become housebound.  I feel the rivotril got me through a very tough time in my life."	The Rivotril didn't have any side effects in the long run, it made me a bit sluggish at first.  However after taking it for a few years and feeling I no longer needed it, I found it impossible to stop taking it as the withdrawal symptoms were so bad.  I have cut the dosage down considerably, from 5 mg at night to one, then I became nervous again and started taking 2 again.  I have tried several times to come off the drug completely but the results have been tremors and feeling sick along with high anxiety to the point of hardly being able to speak.  I would always go back on it.  I never felt I needed MORE...I just coudn't stop taking even a small amount.	"I was told that panic attacks were caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain in the same area that caused epileptic fits.  As Rivotril is a sedative and is given to people with epilepsy they had found that it also helped alleviate panic attacks.  I was prescribed it for this reason.  I am unable to take anti-depressants which also stop panic attacks because of strong side effects so this was a better choice for me at the time.

I feel that it did the job, but had I known I would be on it for the rest of my life I'm not sure I would have started taking it.  But maybe if I was desperate like I was then I would.  I was concerned about taking it while pregnant but my child was normal.  She did have bad withdrawal symptoms though after I stopped breast feeding her.  No one realized that was what was happening when she cried all the time for seemingly no reason.  Back then it was unknown that going off the drug caused withdrawal as the drug had never been used short term.  Only for epileptics for life.  She is 13 now and perfectly normal.  However I do feel guilty about having put her through that."
2722	elavil	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	chronic headaches	"Since I was very young, a child, I suffered debilatating headaches.  Often they became true migraines.  They would last for days and days, sometimes weeks
without stop.  I missed school, parties, holidays.  I was scared to make plans
to do anything fearing the pain.  I pretty much went to bed with some degree of head pain and woke up with it everyday.  I had no clue what it would be like to
live without them.  Sometime late in 1999 I went to my pharmacy to pick us some
prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered
headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  Her eyes were wide
open,  she seemed happy, etc.  She told me her Doctor had put her on Elavil
and within days her headaches subsided.  I went straight to my pain management
physician and asked for Elavil. Two weeks later I started going whole days
without head pain.  I went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  I looked
forward to doing things.  I woke up without pain.  What a miracle!  I have
probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  When
I do get a slight headache it usually disappears within a short time without
additional meds.  Needless to say my entire life changed. I am a better wife, mother, daughter, friend.  I take the generic and notice no difference from
Elavil.  Thank you Elavil."	None that I noticed.	I take one 150 mg tablet of generic Elavil at bedtime.

When researched through forums and blogs, discovered that many experience moderate to severe leg pain with Lipitor. My husband could not recall when the leg and foot pains started and further research indicated that no-flush Niacin (500 mg, 2 x day) along with Policosanol (20 mg 1 x day) could be very effective in lowering cholesterol; therefore, Lipitor was stopped and for six months the laternative routine was started. A recent bloodwork indicated a 30% increase of cholesterol and my husband resumed taking Lipitor. By the way, his leg and foot pains did not diminish when he stopped taking Lipitor.

1051	femring	1	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	hysterectomy	The Femring is great because you insert it and don't have to worry about remembering to take a pill or pills every day. This allows you freedom for the next three months, (90) days until your reorder a new ring.  Also my insurance pays a good portion of the cost of the ring, whereas it did not cover the cost of bio-identical horomone treatments.	The bad thing about this certain dosage of the Femring was on the third day it seemed as though I was beginning to have vaginal irritation.  The fourth day was obvious vaginal irritation with a blistery rash.  Upon feeling and seeing this rash I removed the Femring and called my Dr.	A lower dose Femring was prescribed, 0.05mg/day, which does a good job of returning my horomones levels to close to normal.

Over the next few days I became like a zombie during the day, but by night I would be a crying shaking mess.  On the last day of taking this medication I was truly suicidal and I was not even depressed when I started this medication a week earlier.  This medication was to treat severe anxiety only, and it did help for this, but made me severely depressed as a consequence.

I now use the medication only on an as needed basis rather than take it daily, which is not necessary as my energy levels vary quite a bit. It was also suggested that I try Flexoril (sp) to see if the cause for my fatigue was caused by pain or discomfort which kept me from getting adequate sleep. That was not effective unless I wanted to miss  a day from even more fatigue than usual."

It also caused reduction of pain during intercourse. Improved sex drive and response.

ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE results relating to depression, weight gain, pain in joints & muscles, and fatigue."

3880	abilify	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar disorder	I didn't notice any benefit at all. Supposedly, it was to help keep my mood balanced.

I felt like I had to constantly get up and move around, but it didn't even help.  I couldn't sit still, had major problems sleeping at night, AND started gaining weight.	I was prescribed Abilify (15mg/daily) to assist in moderating my mood.  In the three months I took it, I did not notice any significant improvement in mood stability, and DID notice majorly debilitating side effects.  I finally convinced my doctor to wean me off of it, and I guarantee I will never go back!

It didn't make me jittery. It just boosted my energy. It did give me considerable dry mouth. I did notice that I would be a little more tired if I didn't take it for a couple of days. I think it is mildly addictive. Overall, I gained more benefit from it than negatives. I did worry about blood pressure because it did seem to increase my heartrate. I would recommend it to those who suffer from mild depression and/or just need a little extra energy boost. The medication is actually to treat narcolepsy, a condition in which a patient falls asleep at random times and has trouble staying awake.	Dry mouth, mild addictive properties, slight increase in heart rate.	I took 1 tablet every morning. 100 mg. It was important to take it in the morning.

Nothing has ever effectively controlled my depression but Lamictal seems to have stabilized my condition at a tolerable level. I am more mentally ""resilient"".....I don't stay down too long; I'm able to bounce back quickly from a depressive state. I'm also taking Mirtazapine (30mg; 2 a day).

"Lamictal seems to have increased my sex drive. I'm constantly ""horny"" and masturbate alot. The crazy thing is that Lamictal also seems to cause anorgasmia.....difficulty in achieving orgasm. Most of the time I get 99.9% of the way towards feeling like I'm going to climax but don't. So this med has increased my sex drive but doesn't let me fully enjoy the ""benefits"".

I went back to the doctor and they added in a Ventolin puffer to open the airways 2 puffs 4 times per day in between the symbicort. 5 days later I went back to the doctor wheezing more and with a sort of stuffy nose and serious nasal pain (mostly from coughing so much. He told me I caught a sinus infection since the steroid lowers your emmmune system and makes it easier to catch another infection. He then prescribed me to 50 mg of Prednisone each day for a 3 day term so that it could tackle the inflammation fast so that the cortisone puffer would be able to catch up ( it couldn't work fast enough as it takes a while to start working) and also prescribed me to Amoxicillin for the sinus infection (since it was caused by bacteria) He said he would have prescribed me the antibiotic even if i didn't catch the sinus infection as an immune booster since prednisone lowers your immune system.. I took my first prednisone yesterday for the first time, it made me feel good for 9 hours or so but gave me some joint pain. The next day I felt a little better but still coughing and sick until I took the Prednisone again. (today at 2:00pm) It is now 11:00pm and I am flighing high (thats probably why I am writing in a blog and feel awesome, I feel like I could run a marathon. I also just drank a coffee and I don't think it helped. No coughing. Hopefully I can sleep tonight.. I used to take Ritalin for ADD and this kind of feels like that. I think tomorrow I will feel a little better, great again when I am on the Prednisone, and hopefully after that the puffer will Finnish off fixing the inflammation. Did anyone get hearing loss when taking prednisone? Its like when your on an airplane and your ears need to be popped but you cant pop them. I checked online and all I could find is prednisone fixes hearing loss..haha.. weird anyways.. Overall I think it works great!

I'll take it for as long as I need to. Find a good Dr and PLEASE listen to them and take it if you need to. Don't live in misery because of the stigma society sometimes puts on mental health issues. Screw society and put your mental health first!"

1720	retin-a-micro	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Made skin moderately better for a few months	Made skin EXTREMELY dry and flaky, almost unbearable, even moisturizer couldn't fix it	When I first started using it, it made my skin really irritated and it was super itchy and dry, it was flaking like crazy. It was the beginning of the summer, so I didn't have to worry about school, but if it was during school, I would have been so upset.  After about a week or so, it remained dry but the flakiness went away. My skin started clearing up, but it was still oily, and I still had bad blackheads and I continued getting pimples.  After a while, it started spreading to my cheeks, which used to be super clear, and even though most of the pimples were gone, they left dark spots behind.  After about a year of still having bad skin, I decided I'd go to my dermatologist and get something different. They put me on Solodyn, Atralyn and Aconya, which completely fixed the dryness the Retin-a-Micro gave me. I wouldn't recommend Retin-a-Micro, it makes your skin feel super bad.

I had slept a lot but never waking rested, just extremely sleepy and depressed. I called pharmacist on weekend and was told I was taking too much to start.

I take one 15mg dose of methotrexate once a week along with sulphasalazine and naproxen to reduce activity of my very active rheumatoid arthritis. The pain and inflammation is still there but has reduced slightly. I also take Bendroflumethazide to reduce high blood pressure taken on a daily basis.  I have researched on the internet and found I need to increase my daily intake of water/fluids. This has never been mentioned in the contraindications or by my GP. I understand the reason for increasing fluid intake is because the medication I take is cytoxic and I need to keep my kidneys and liver flushed as much as possible, which is why patients who take methotrexate and sulphasalazine have monthly blood tests.

491	meridia	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	obesity	Initially weightloss of 4 stone and an increase in energy and confidence. After stopping the drug there was a gradual weight gain of 10lbs until weight settled and has been maintained for 3 years. Health has improved and an increase in fitness and regular exercise has been maintained.Benefits have outwayed the side effects as all other attempts over the years to lose weight had failed, and there is a family history of heart disease.	Side effects at the time included worsened insomnia and irregular menstruation ( already suffered from before starting drug, but worse while taking it) and mood swings. Insomnia and irregular menstruation have continued, mood swings have improved but both continued conditions may have worsened naturally anyway due to naturally occurring early peri-menopause as there is a family history of this.	Drug dosage reccomendations were not followed, and only taken in the morning as this lessened the side effects.
2298	lexapro	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression and anxiety	Seemed to take effect after the first dose. I noticed a considerable reduction in my anxiety and feelings of sadness. I was able to overlook the little things where as before they would really get to me. I was having all kinds of muscle twitches so I went to see my doctor who examined me and decided it was due to my stress levels. I am a mother and a wife and I was reluctant to take anything to help with my situation but am now glad I did.. I am only a week into it so I guess time will tell. But so far I am happy with the results.	Slight headache/stress in neck after the first dose although could be due to my resistant feelings of taking this to begin with. A bit of feeling shaky right after taking doses but controlable.	I am to meet up with my doctor again after 2 weeks to see how it is affecting me. I am taking 10mg once a day in the afternoon after lunch. I have made an appointment with a therapist to also help me. I don't see this as a forever fix but for now it is doing the trick..... Meanwhile it allows me to focus and feel like I want to better myself so in the end I am hoping that this is just a bandaid until I heal myself or find a way to deal with things as needed.
3741	lamictal	2	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	While on the drug, I experienced some level of mood stabilization, marked by a greater ability to 'flow with' daily stress.	About six weeks ago, I noticed that my hair -- which has been quite thick throughout my life -- was markedly thinner.  My scalp is patchy in spots and the hair is beginning to thin out in clumps on the top of my head.	I am, under the direction of my doctor, reducing dosage in 25 mg increments and taking several vitamin/mineral combinations, including copper, zinc, biotin, and selenium.  But there is no assurance that my hair loss will ever reverse itself -- in fact, it may continue.

I usually do not take the afternoon dose unless I feel really tired and nervous about driving.
826	zegerid	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	I have a great reduction in stomach acid problems. When I've tried to use natural products like Alo Vera juice or licorice-based products, to take care of the problem, it is very difficult, and I have to take products throughout the day to have any success whatsoever. So taking one pill first thing in the morning holds me most of the day, though I often begin to get some acid in the evening.	As far as I can tell, there are no side effects. I have heard things about these proton inhibitors doing something to the bones, though, making for bone problems, but there's no way I can tell whether it's happening to me. My bone situation has actually improved while on this medication because I've been working out in the gym with weights.	The simplicity is one of the best features. I take the pill with a glass of water first thing in the morning, wait at least 1/2 an hour before eating anything, and I'm done!

I've been using it for 6 to 7 months and I noticed hair regrowth within the second month.i did not do any research on the side effects and now that I think of it my eractions arn't what they use to be. I'm wondering if I stop using this drug if I will start balding again and the side effects will go away?
3793	keflex	1	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	tooth infection	Really cut down the tooth infection/pain and swollen glands, during the first course of treatment I did not have any side effects at all.	Severe diarrhea, very severe vomiting	I was given keflex (3x daily) for an infected root canal that needed to be redone. The swelling, pain and swollen glands subsided substantially while I was waiting 2 weeks for my appt to have the root canal redone. After the root canal, the dentist put me back on the keflex (2x daily) to insure against further infection, also since I have mitral valve prolapse. After 2 doses I developed diarrhea and took .5mg of immodium (I am sensitive to immodium, only need a very small dose). 8 hours later I developed worse diarrhea and then very severe vomiting, stomach pain, severe headache, dizziness, chills. Also my muscles were shaking and cramping as if I was very cold. I had to be taken to the urgent care, received an injection of phenergan which helped, and told never to take keflex again. Flu test was negative, I had not eaten anything during that day which could have caused food poisoning. Dx: gastroenteritis caused by keflex.

139	valtrex	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	cold sores	Decreased symptoms	Didnt feel any side effects.	I've been suffering from cold sores all my life, usually getting one after a cold in the winter season. If my stress levels are up i usually get one as well either under my nose or on my lips. After finally using valtex my symptoms were reduced to 7 days. Prior to that i would be suffering for almost 3 weeks with theses bad boys!!!! Key to survival, take this pill as soon as u feel the tingle, if not it will come just not as bad.
3846	voltaren	2	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	chronic back pain	I was perscribed this after I decided to quite narcotic pain killers.  I was taking fairly large doses of Oxycotin and switched to Voltaren 75mg.  They will not touch my pain.  I guess I have a high tolerance for pain meds.  I don't believe they would be effective for people with chronic moderate to severe pain.	Upset stomach.	I was perscribed 75mgs X 2 per day.  I take double that amount and still have very little relief.
2579	klonopin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	being able to sleep/decrease anxiety surrounding  getting to sleep and staying asleep. Also taken during times of high anxiety. Helped to control anger outbursts and uncontrolled anxiety.	sometimes a hangover effect in the morning if I took it late in the evening and had to get up early. Need about 10 hours to have it leave the system.	take as needed for anxiety when going to bed/sleep. I have a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep and this medication seemed to take the edge off of my anxiety so that I could fall asleep and then stay asleep. Or at least get back to sleep and not feel startled.
250	wellbutrin-xl	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I had been on many different treatments for depression throughout most of my adult life and the side effects seamed to outweigh the benefits.  Since starting to take wellbutrin my sex drive returned, my ambition and motivation returned.  On my last medication I was going to sleep at 8 p.m and sleeping until morning then requiring a nap in the afternoon and now I sleep 7-8 hrs a night and have enough energy to get through most of my days.  I had a 5 lb weight loss in the beginning that I have maintained.  Over all I feel I am managing my depression better than I have at any time in the past.	Side effects in the beginning were a bit of anxiety that eventually past but recently I have been having trouble concentrating, my memory has been poor.  Generally I feel like my iq has dropped  I have also been very teary and find myself crying a fair amount over small incidences almost like I was pregnant.  None of this may have anything to do with the medication but I am concerned.	I went up to 450mg once a day but cut back to 300mg a day about 6-8 mnths ago and didn't find I was less able to cope with my depression. I do find that I feel depressed more often but I recognize the signs of the depression and use coping stragies to deal with what is happening.
342	neurontin	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	restless leg syndrome	Reduced pain in legs and forearms, and blocked the pain from the arthritis in my lower back.  The pain in my legs from the RLS is considerably lessoned.  I also was in chronic pain from my arthritis, but can now move around without any pain, (unless I lift or do any type of work that is strenuous), but I used to be in so much pain that I would cry, so it was definitely worth it for me to take Neurontin.	None.	Three 600 mg. tabs in the a.m. and three 600 mg. tabs at bedtime.
3243	nuvaring	5	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control	Very easy birth control method. You don't have to worry about taking a pill every day. Day to day I can't feel it at all and my husband can't either. Stays in place.	"I've been more moody the past few weeks. I have also experince increased nausea. My GERD has acted up as well. My husband cannot feel it and normally I can't either, but ""while in use"" It has been pinching me. I'm hoping these side effects will go away if I continue use."	none
796	ambien	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia	Fast- acting, works in 15-20 mins.	No side effects!	I've had insomnia since I was a kid--couldn't shut the old mind down. I used Tylenol PM for years but it stopped working for me. Ambien has been great. It usually puts me to sleep within thirty minutes though I have had trouble getting to sleep after eating too much before bedtime. I have very active dreams, but always have had. If I try to fight it and stay up, I do hallucinate and have said and done things I don't remember. My sons tell me funny stories. I feel great the next day and don't feel drugged at all.
1005	darvocet-n	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	pain	Treatment benefits were to address pain and discomfort.  It was perscribed to me after I was in the hospital instead of Vicaden (spelling?), as Vicaden does not suite me well.  The medication began working after about 45 minutes of taking it and (for me) lasted over 6 hours.	Treatment side effects for me were nausea and feeling unclear or 'loopy'. I found that if I took more than one pill within six hours, I became very nauseated.  In addition, I would not have been able to function properly or drive a car comfortably because of the side effects with my clarity.	The treatment was for pain and was taken by myself for a situation that could not have been allieviated by medical attention.  I had an ovarian cyst rupture.  My doctor and the ER told me there was really nothing for them to do other than wait for it to be reabsorbed.  So, pain medication was my last resort.  I took a few of these pills over two days to help alleviate my extreme pain.
441	lorazepam	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	sleep problems	able to sleep through the night	sometimes difficult to wake up	prescribed by a psychiatrist after the patient failed to get good results with over the counter sleep remedies.
1310	fexofenadine	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	seasonal allergy	"Controlled itching in eyes, nasal and chest congestion, and ""tickle cough"" very well"	No direct side effects but I used to take OTC allergy med (loratidine) except during extreme periods, then I would switch to the prescription for two months or so.  Now the allergy seems unresponsive to the over the counter medication, no matter what time of year it is.  I do not know if my allergy has changed or if I have become dependent on the fexofenadine.	One 180 mg tablet each morning as needed for sinus.
3721	lamictal	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar ii	lifted depression, calmed violent mood swings	I've been lucky with side effects. It has been entirely weight-neutral, which was a big consideration for me. I had some very pleasant side effects when I first started taking the drug--vivid but enjoyable dreams and an increase in sexuality. The only negative effects were sometimes having to reach to find the word I was trying to use (which has since lessened, although it still happens occasionally) and pretty bad acne (which I am now treating separately and is much better.) Neither of those effects are on the PI sheet, and my doctor seems very skeptical that either was caused by the drug, but I've found lots of anecdotal evidence of other people experiencing similar things. Regardless, the effects have been minimal and WELL worth it considering how much I've been helped.	"I started treatment when I was in what seemed like a mixed state--barely able to leave my bed at times, having to go into the bathroom at work to cry nearly every day, having strong urges to self-mutilate, and having a lot of suicidal ideation. I was also very agitated and angry, lashing out at loved ones for seemingly no reason. Lamotrigine started lifting the depression almost immediately, and once I hit the theraputic dose of 200 mg, it was like a cloud lifted overnight. I still have some ups and downs, but nothing major, and even when destructive thoughts cross my mind, I'm able to push them away more easily.

I have recently had a rather intense relapse into bulimia, but I doubt that's related to the lamotrigine either way."
2930	tramadol	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	abdominal pain	I have severe pain in my lower abdomin that was so strong I couldn't sleep nor move around very well. Luckily I sit mostly at work so I was able to deal with a little while, but eventually I went to the ER and they prescribed me this. Which I have never heard or taken before.	"I have read that a lot of people who take this are very tired and sleepy. I believe that everyone's body reacts differently to drugs. As far as my side effects goes I feel great. Almost a natural ""high"" if you will. I am very talkative and focused. I will say that I do not have much of an appetite. My stomach feels fine and the lower pain has gone away for the most part. I do realize I am taking more pills now because the effectivness has worn off a bit, doing my research on this I have heard that being the case many times."	Overall I am going to a OBGYN specialist next week and they are going to  determine what is the exact problem. As urgent care and the hospitalcould not figure it out, which scares me truthfully. Hopefully I will not have to take anything and the pain will go away. I recommend this to anyone who has moderate to severe pain as it has helped me dramatically, good luck to all. Pain is not something I wish on anyone.
920	paxil	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression and anxiety	Paxil quickly improved my depression and also helped with mild anxiety issues I was experiencing.  I was very pleased with the speed with which my depression improved.  Within four weeks I was feeling better than I had felt in a very long time.  I have been on it for two months and am still improving.	During the second week I experienced stomach problems.  I had diarrhea that lasted for about a week.  I also had moderate headaches which lasted a little longer than the stomach issues.	I went to the doctor due to problems associated with my depression.  I had been taking Wellbutrin but it seemed to be losing its effect.  The doctor recommended adding another antidepressant to boost the Wellbutrin.  I attempted three other anti-depressants but had severe side effects. Zoloft, Lexapro, and Celexa all caused me to have severe diarrhea.  During the four weeks that I stayed with Zoloft I experienced little improvement and lost 15 pounds as a result of the diarrhea and lack of appetite.
43	zyprexa	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	bipolar disorder type ii	While taking Zyprexa, I never experienced any episodes of hypomania (low mania) which typically accompany Bipolar Type II; however, I attribute this mostly to the fact that Zyprexa is very sedating. It should be noted that although Zyprexa is classified as an A-typical antipsychotic, it is also used as a mood stabilizer in patients with Bipolar Disorder.	"Increased appetite which of course lead to weight gain which caused me to feel depressed!  I am not exaggerating when I say my appetite was almost insatiable. Excessive sleepiness during the day which caused me to actually start falling asleep while talking to someone on several occassions.  It also made me feel almost ""numb"" emotionally.  Sedation along with an insatiable appetite caused me to gain over 25 pounds."	My psychiatrist prescribed Zyprexa to help with the mood swings of Bipolar Disorder.  I am classified as Bipolar Type II because I do not experience the extreme highs of mania (manic episodes) that accompany Bipolar Type I.  I do, however, experience hypomania (hypo meaning low) so my moods still swing from highs to the extreme lows of depression.
2343	propecia	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	hair loss	Possible slight improvements in texture.	Erectile problems,Severe anxiety, panic attacks, negative thoughts, depression, brain fog. Effected not only myself, but my family. This was not me. Only took for three months. Took much longer for side effects to subside. In my opinion a dangerous drug. May not have the same effect on everyone, but these side effects seem to be common enough to be documented and taken seriously. At this point seem to be being ignored.	Took once daily until side effects became unbearable.

2178	frova	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine headache	Frova eliminated Migraine Headaches and the effect would last 24 hours.	The effect was slow.  Approximately one or two hours before any significant pain relief was noticed.  Also, some nausea from the drug.	As soon as a migraine was detected a Frova would be administered.  If the migraine was intercepted immediately the Frova was succesful with relieving pain and the chance of a rebound headache was slim.  If a frova was not administered immediately a maxalt was taken then two hours afterwards a frova.  This would eliminate pain for twenty four to thirty hours. On occasion a rebound headache would occur.

I have a dry mouth and eyes. Drug has decreased effectiveness in last 5 years.	Prescribed at 300 mg per day, have taken as much 450 mg per day. I like this drug because it has few side effects.

I believe that I have gained weight due to taking BP medication. I feel that my metabolic rate has been affected by these meds.

475	remicade	5	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	colitis	Stopped bleeding and relieved some abdominal cramps.	After only 3 treatments I have developed common side effects, as in dizzines which keeps me from being too active. I am always tired even though I am finally sleeping most of the night, I have developed the bumps on the forhead that everyone talks about, and I have the need to constantly unrinate. I have been reading reviews online now for a week and am getting concerned because most comments show that people find the side effects worse than the condition and I have just started. I believe that I am also suffering from depression, but because I am a single parent I try to keep myself busy with family issues which allows me to put aside the bad feelings temporarily.	Have done 3 infusions, starting with 2 weeks after first and then 4 weeks. Now I am awaiting my 4th which will be 8 weeks. The staff have been great, from the nurse who does the procedure to the councillor at Bio-Advance, but the one draw back is that I have been telling both the nurse and the councillor about my side effects and they acted so surprised. So why did I find out by going online myself that these side effects are common?
534	trazodone	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia	Trazodone allows me to fall asleep within ten minutes and sleep through the night, awaking in the morning without grogginess.	I have noticed no side effects. I have never needed to increase my dosage over the course of five years, and when I skip a dose, my insomnia is exactly what it was before taking trazodone, no worse.	50 mg taken with water directly before bed puts me to sleep within ten minutes or so. I wake up 7-8 hours later (unless forced to get up earlier by my alarm clock) without feeling drugged or groggy. The insomnia being treated was the kind where I was able to fall asleep after about a half hour in bed, but then I would wake up again after a couple of hours and be unable to fall back asleep. This mild, nonaddictive drug has successfully addressed the insomnia that has affected me since childhood.
1331	prevacid	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	gerd/acid reflux	I had tried EVERY over the counter product for acid reflux and none of them worked. I also have tried other prescriptions for acid reflux and none have worked for me as well as Prevacid has.	I have found that if I take it too early prior to going to bed, it's less effective. Also, there have been a few times (very few) where it hasn't worked and I have gotten acid reflux (ash taste in mouth, vomiting, pain in throat and chest)  Also, for whatever reason, there also have been times I have had to take 2 pills versus the usual 1 pill.	One pill once a day. The ingredients are supposed to limit or decrease acid reflux.
897	paxil	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	The patient's was able to see positive effects in 2 weeks time.  She noted an improvement in mood, spouse noted a reduction in symptoms relating to prementrual syndrome, and a return of normal sleep patterns.  Overall return of positive mood and enjoyment of previous activities.	Patient was taking the medication in the morning.  At night, a jittery restless feeling was noted which required the patient to get out of bed and move around for about 20 minutes before returning to bed.  The patient switched medication times to the evening before bed and the restlessness did not return.  The patient also noted that the desire to consume sweets or carbohydrates was markedly reduced during treatment.	Treatment was easy to administer, being only once a day, and could be altered easily (am or pm).  There were no cardiovascular side effects, no dizziness, blurred vision, or nausea associated with treatment with 10 mg. paroxetine.  The mild side effects such as reduced craving for carbohydrates and feeling full earlier during a meal were not considered problematic.  The patient's clinical signs of depression, which were insomnia, and reduced enjoyment of former hobbies were reversed within a short period of time (2-3 weeks).
267	ultram	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	tempromandibular joint dysfunction (tmj)	Taking Tramadol has resulted in the effective management of chronic pain due to severe TMJ.	The side effects of taking Tramadol for 11 years is addiction.  If I miss a dose, I experience typical withdrawal symptoms (e.g., nausea, headache, restless leg syndrome, stomach cramps).	Tramadol was prescribed after suffering from TMJ for over 20 years. I suffered from chronic pain due to severe TMJ complications.  In addition, the TMJ was causing migraine headaches and insomnia.  After all conventional methods of treatment (e.g., exercises, mouth appliances etc.) and drugs (e.g, ibuprofen) did not alleviate the problem, symptoms or pain, the only option left was surgery.  Because surgery for TMJ conditions is not a guarantee for success, I was reluctant to agree to the procedure.  Finally, as a last resort, I met with a doctor who specialized in chronic pain management and I was prescribed Tramadol, 100 mg/twice daily.  This drug has worked extremely well for the past 11 years in controlling the pain.
233	wellbutrin-xl	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	The drug caused the depression to recede to the point that I was able to function normally. The libido lowering effects of a prior antidepressent (SSRI) were alleviated completely. I was able to lose excess weight gained during treatment with the other SSRI	Occasionally I would have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep if I took the drug too late in the day. I began to take it upon wakening daily to counter those effects.	I took one tablet per day 300 mg of the Wellbutrin XL.
3261	allegra-d	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergies	Decongestion, elimination of sinus pressure and tearing of eyes	Jittery feeling, sleeplessness and on occasion nausea.  This medication always makes me nauseas if I take it with other vitamins or other medication such as Advil.	I switched from 12 hour to 24 hour however feel that the 12 hour tablet met my needs better than the 24 hour tablet.  The 24 hour tablet seemed to run out of steam and during the heavy allergy season, my syptoms would reappear.
4036	tri-luma	5	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	hyperpigmentation	Mild lightening of age and sun spots.	Slight dryness at the beginning of treatment. Increased sun sensitivity.	"Started using the cream every other night and increased it to every night. It somewhat lightened my freckles and age spots pretty quickly (within a couple of weeks) but after that stopped helping. I also had a brown patchy area on my leg that has been around forever. I used it as my ""test"" patch to monitor progress. Just like my face it lightened the spot pretty quickly and then stopped working. The spot since then has remained lighter but has never gone away altogether. 
I would say I saw a 25% improvement in the sun spots on my face.  I have a lot of them so overall it didn't really make a difference in how my skin looks. 
I did not have much irritation when I started using this product but I had been using Retin A before I started the Tri Luma so maybe my skin was used to it already. I did notice that it stung the skin around my eyes when I used it on the brown spots high up on my cheekbones.
Also, was told it would help reduce acne and breakouts.  It did not which is disappointing. 
I use 50+ sunscreen every day and stay out of direct sunlight."
2076	metformin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	metabolic disorder	Weight loss of over 10 pounds in 4 months, continuing weight loss at a gradual rate (need to lose 40 pounds total).  Complete curbing of sugar and carbohydrate cravings, increased appetite control, cessation of binge eating patterns.	Diarreha if I eat more sugar than I should, some abdominal cramping, again, only if I ate something I shouldn't have.	Began at 500 mg once daily, increased to 500 mg twice daily, then increased to 2000 mg (1000 mg twice daily).  I believe that the slow increase of the dosage helped control any negative side effects.  It took about 3 months to really start noticing a difference, but that could be due to the titrating schedule.  I am also trying to be more conscious of what I do eat and when, which is helping with the weight loss and appetite issues.
287	panixine-disperdose	9	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sinus infection	The treatment benefits were that the cephalexin relieved the sinus infection around the 4th day and by the seventh day my sinuses felt better. The cephalexin seemed relatively mild as I did not experience any intestinal discomfort, bloating or cramping that I have experienced with other antibiotics.	I developed vaginitis and a yeast infection. This usually starts to occur around four or five days after I finish a round of antibiotics. This reaction to antibiotics first started to occur around ten years ago after I was treated with tetracycline for six months for a severe case of lyme's disease.	I had a sinus infection and was instructed to take 500mg. of cephalexin every 6 hours for seven days. It took four days before the cephalexin took effect. I have a hard time getting an antibiotic that I don't have a negative reacton to. I am allergic to penecilan and can't take Z-pack because it severely upsets my intestinal tract.
737	flonase	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	This spray clears the nasal passages to promote free breathing. I've tried over the counter remedies but they are harsh and you end up practically addicted to them. This works much the same way but is non-addictive and need only be used when symptoms hit. I have used this same product when I've had a head cold and achieved the same results. I'm pretty sure that's not what it's intended for but whenever I've got sinus pressure, I take this product.	I've experienced no side effects.	Simply shake the bottle, and use 2 sprays in each nostril daily.
514	tenormin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	my blood pressure stayed in the normal range. the headaches I was having from hypertension subsided.	i had no side effects	i developed high blood pressure triggered, i feel, by stress from a divorce and possibly from hormone imbalance from stress due to the divorce and its ramifications. i would have headaches everyday and was checking my blood pressure while i was having a headache and at times when i did not have a headache. it was most definitely elevating during a headache. i tried one other medication first with no success. my Dr. switched me to atenolol with good results. It also corrected the occasional premature cardiac beats I was having. the dosage is low so i continue to take it for the normal sinus rhythm as my blood pressure problem is now resolved.

The pain that I normally get in my chest (from my Crohn's) is gone.

2662	prinivil	2	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high blood pressure	Lowered blood pressure	Coughing,fatigue, hair loss	Took Lisinopril once per day
3393	coumadin	5	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	blood clots	Prevented a recurrence of the leg and lung clots during the period of therapy and helped the body stabilize long enough to repair and/or work around the damaged areas, eventually resulting in elimination of pain and swelling.	Minor bruising and longer bleeding times with cuts, but nothing serious. Occasional dizziness when the INR counts went above 3 or 4. It's difficult at times to get a stable INR reading due to all the various foods, supplements, and drugs which either increase or decrease Coumadin's effects.	Prescribed Coumadin after DVT and PE stay (with IV heparin first) for six months. Weekly blood tests until INR levels stabilized, then biweekly. One 5 mg pill taken daily with warnings to watch food, drug and supplement intake.
1690	claritin	8	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	irritated and sore throat,nose,eyes and sneezing.	I suffered swollen and extremely sore throats with lots of mucus gathering up at the back of my throat. Because of this, I ended up having my tonsils and adenoids removed separately but this did not help at all. I also relieved several treatments for antibiotics but this was wasted as all they did was lowered my immune system. After being diagnosed with an airborne allergy, I took one tablet daily, they worked on the first day and completely helped.	The drowsiness was overwhelming, I was sleeping for about 16hours a day with no relief after and my appetite increased rapidly. I was consuming about three times my usual intake.	Overall, they worked but the side affects were incredibly bad.
819	ambien	3	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	insomnia	Fell fast asleep for the first few months, then I had to keep upping the dose and addiction set in. I had a horrible time with withdrawal symtoms. I experienced sever apnia while under the influence of Ambien and I hand morning hangover. It also agitated me and I experienced anxiety.	see above	For menopausal insomnia and PTS from cancer
832	zegerid	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	reflux	Acid in the stomach was reduced so that the reflux was kept under control.  Therefore there was little of no chance of irritation of the esophagus.	Constipation and even less chance of digesting food properly.	Even though the reflux was kept under control I felt that constipation and poor digestion was a bad trade-off.  As there is bowel cancer in the family clearing of the large intestine is important to me.  I have now stopped taking the drug and prefer to treat the reflux by taking care of what I eat, how and when I eat, and being careful not to bend over too much after food.  I also use ginger tea which helps to regulate the stomach acid.
2449	symbyax	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	depression	none, side effects that were intolerable were an increase in appetite and decreased libido	"increased appetite
decreased libidp"	one pill daily at bedtime
279	xyrem	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	narcolepsy	Xyrem has been life-changing for me and more than I could have ever hoped for.  I spent most of my life completely exhausted and desperately tired.  The worst part was, I always just thought I was lazy.  Even after I was diagnosed, and was on Provigil (I was taking Provigil only for years before Xyrem)I still questioned if I really had a sleep disorder and thought that perhaps I was just lazier than everyone else.  Now that I take Xyrem, I know that I really do have a sleep disorder because Xyrem has changed my life so much.  I could have never imagined how much better and easier life is with a good nights sleep.  Without Xyrem, I spend most too much time in REM sleep.  I would dream constantly, beginning almost immediately after I would fall asleep.  Almost every morning I would wake up and still be in a dream.  Xyrem forces me into NREM sleep and it has made all the difference for me.	Im sure it causes night sweats and significant weight loss.  Other side effects that may or may not be related that I experience (although I also started taking it after the birth of my first child and may be related to that rather than the Xyrem)were receeding hairline, short term memory impact, some decrease in cognitive function such as difficulty with word recall, following a more complex line of reasoning, etc.., and increased anxiety.  Even given the side effects, my life is so much better now that I am not so exhausted and I can't imagine going back to life before Xyrem.	1 dose right before bed and another 3-4 hours later.
3731	lamictal	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar disorder	Lamictal is by far the best medicine that I have been perscribed. It almost has completly controlled my depression which was very severe, and has almost completly controled my mania. I still get slightly hypomanic, but this has not been a problem for me.	I originally took Lamictal 200mg once a day for two months in March 2008 and had to stop because of moderate memory loss(mild long term loss and  moderate/severe short term loss), loss of ballence, and fatigue.I was sometimes in a mental fog. I would repeat the same things several times an hour and not remeber that I had said it. When I first started taking Lamictal I was leaving for college in a few months and my doctor(whom I no longer see)rushed me to raise my perscription very quickly.During that time it had completly controled my depression and mania.	I am currently taking it, and started taking it again in September 2009. I now take 150mg once a day. I have not had any side effects since I started taking it again in september.I partially believe that the reason it is so effective now is that I am 20 lbs heavier than I was when I first took Lamictal and because I now take a lower dose.
2640	ketoconazole	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	ringworm/pityriasis	The skin rash was better	I can not be sure it was from the medication but I had mild stomach upset	I originally had lamisil cream to treat a  pretty bad case of ringworm.  After about 4 days the rash was spreading and so I went back and received oral Lamisil. I took that for 14 days and the rash was lighter but still there. The doctor then prescribed Ketoconazole and after 3 days the rash was significantly lighter. By the end of the prescription the rash was almost completely gone.
3908	nexium	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	sore throat healed due to reduction in stomach acid	none	not sure
3876	levoxyl	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	Improved metabolism, decreased depression, increased energy, decreased hair loss, and improved finger/toenail condition.	There were no side effects.	I have been taking Levoxyl for 7 years. In that time, I have had no problems with depression and was able to cease taking an antidepressant. My metabolism is regular. I have no problems with fatigue.
2091	selegiline	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	cognitive enhancement	More enrgy,better memory and concentration and clarity	none observed.	Injection of testosterone and oral tablets of Deprenyl
3935	nexium	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	gerd	Less reflux acidity	None	I took the drug for my severe gerd gastro esophageal reflux disease. I used to take anti acid but was not effective and this drug was more effective. The doctor prescribed first losec but nexium appears to be less costy and with the same benifit. Nexium worked the whole dayand i had less acidity feeling at night. But my condition went worse and i did funduplication surgery and now i dont need it
2543	cosopt	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	high interoccular pressure	Cosopt reduced my occular pressure in both eyes by nearly one third which pleased my eye doctor. The treatment benefits are long term. Reducing occular pressure will prolong eyesight by preserving the optical nerves. Sorry not 50 words.	I suspect it caused increased hair loss (thining) which I became aware of after about two - two and a half years of using the medication. I had hair loss before ever starting medications but it seems like this medicine began increasing the problem. Cosopt burned initially on application and turned the eyes red which cleared up fairly quickly. I am not aware of any other side effect. I switched medications and further explanation is below. If I knew these drugs do cause hair loss it might affect its rating,... but then again it does save the eyes.	I had elevated occular pressure that needed to be reduced and my doctor put me on xalatan which caused my eyelashes to begin to thicken and become dark in a couple of months so I had him put me on something else so we went to cosopt. After a time I felt like this was causing increased hair loss so I looked up drug side effects and cosopt was listed as causing hair loss so I had him change it again then I started alphagan p and azopt. My eyes after nearly two months time turned red and never cleared up so the doctor dropped the alphagan p and replaced it with timilol 0.25 percent. The redness quickly went away. Now with azopt in each eye once in the morning and once at bedtime and timilol 0.25 in both in the mornings only my occular pressures have been reduced one to two points lower in each eye than what the cosopt did when taken in the morning and at bedtime. These changes have not stopped the hair loss from occuring even though timilol 0.25 percent has half the timilol in it as the cosopt and is used only once a day in each eye vs cosopts twice a day in each eye. Azopt is reported to cause hair loss and is very similar to the second ingredient in cosopt.

I basically went from a full head of hair to half bald in a span of 3 years.Also arthritis type pain between joints if you take too much for too long. Sometimes i had to lay off of it for a few weeks to regain my strength. This stuff has some serious side effects. Men feel the side effects much worse then woman do.	make sure your doctor prescribes you 800 mg because its wayy cheaper because you can cut them in half if you want because they are tablets. Its like the same price as the 200 mg for the same count so its really stupid to get the lower dose when you can just cut up the higher dose.

C serum
3205	arava	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis	I added this medication 8 months after I began monthly infusions of Orencia. Orencia alone gave mild improvement in symptoms of severe rheumatoid arthritis. (I had extensive and severe joint pain and inflammation, severe edema in legs due to knee inflammation, and had very limited mobility.) Within 6-8 weeks of beginning Leflunomide (and still continuing Orencia), symptoms began to decrease significantly, and my lab values improved dramatically. As I write this I have very little pain and inflammation, and much more mobility than before - even considering the joint damage I've sustained. Recently, I tried reducing my dose of Leflunomide to 10 mg/day. After 4-6 weeks or so, I began to have more symptoms. When I resumed the 20mg/day dose, symptoms decreased dramatically again - in about 6-8 weeks.	"I have some GI distress, but am not sure if it's directly due to Leflunomide or to a long history of taking RA medications which also negative have GI effects.

I had a very serious eye infection last year which resulted in corneal scarring and loss of much vision in one eye. It's very possible that my immune-suppressed condition (Leflunomide and Orencia)resulted in a more serious infection and slower healing time than if I were not on immunosuppressants."	One pill a day with dinner!

3585	differin	5	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	I haven't noticed too much of a difference so far.	I did not put it on near my eyes but somehow the whole area around my eyes is bright red and very sensitive. (I look like a raccoon.)  It burns my face - especially around my eyes - when I use any moisturizer or sunscreen. I had to switch to a milder cleanser to reduce irritation.	My dermatologist prescribed this with a water pill and some kind of anti-bacteria medicine to treat my acne.  I have been on Yaz for a year and it has not helped my acne at all. All over the counter medicines have been ineffective.  I mostly break out around my period and I only get pimples where I have hair folicles.
4009	celexa	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	depression	I really did not see any benefit in taking the medication.  However, this may have been because I was unable to tolerate it for any length of time.	"Severe abdominal cramping and diarrhea, dizziness, ""spacy"" feeling, fainting due to the severe diarrhea."	I was placed ont this medication to help with lack of energy, inability to sleep, loss of appetite (depression symptoms).

Annual allergies need to be rotated, so I have now used Allegra, Claritin, Zyrtec, Singulair, and Flonase in rotation.  All of these worked very well except for Singulair.

1790	citalopram	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I found that this drug immediately released alot of emotion - which was suprising.  I wept for about a week - I had no idea what was going on at first, and then I realized that - I could actually FEEL my emotions.  I felt normal and healthy.  I regret going off of this drug too soon, as I did.  I switched to Wellbutrin, which was not a good idea.	Mild drowsiness.  Emotionalism.	over the counter.

There didn't seem to be any noticeable side effects.	Having suffered from recurrent severe cold sores in the past, I began taking 200mg  five times a day once the onset of another attack became obvious.

3047	seroquel	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar disorder	Manic episodes have been minimised! Although having to increase my dosage gradually to get rid of the highs altogether.  Also puts me to sleep, whereas I used to be awake most nights from mania.

I started at a 20 mg pill once daily. I notice approx. 1 yr. later I was still SLIGHTLY depressed, so my Dr. prescribed I move up to 30 mg. I felt great.  In the fall, I noticed 'blue'. (S.A.D.  ?) So my Dr. again prescribed that I move up to 40 mg throughout the winter months to see if that helps with seasonal affective disorder, & that I can start to ween myself back down to 30mg shortly before spring. The only side effect I've noticed so far, has been some mild sweating durting the night that started when I started taking the 40mg. Other than that, I have loved the way I feel since I've been taking Citalopram.    So far so good.

It worked quickly to eliminate the plaque on the trunk of body, but patient has been unable to wean from the drug because psoriasis has never completely gon away on arms and legs.  We are now looking at Enbrol.

896	paxil	1	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	The drug did help with the temporary depression.	However, the heart palpatations created a condition which was diagnoised as a mitral valve prolapse.  I was told that the condition was congenital.  I explained that I had never had the symptoms/or condition before and was sure that it would have been diagnosed in the 43+ years prior.  After about 12 years, I still, from time to time experience palpatations or flutters around my heart.  About three years ago, I was examined by a heart specialist.  He reevaluated me and said that I DID NOT HAVE mitral valve prolapse.  GO FIGURE.	Depression treated.  The mitral value prolapse was not treated but noted when any medical or dental treatment was performed.
974	macrobid	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	bladder infection	No treatment benefit, because the complete prescription was not used because of adverse side effects.

3157	prednisone	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	nasal polyps	To reduce the inflammation of the nasal polyp. By doing so, this should allow me better breathing. I was experiencing sleeplessness, due to inability to breathe well and also to have to sleep in a propped up position.

Following the steroids, I am going to have endoscopic sinus surgery to treat the blockages in my sinus passages.
3520	lunesta	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	I usually slept through the night and did not experience drowsiness the next day.	I had a bad taste in my mouth in the morning.  This was mildly irritating and much better than not sleeping.  It didn't put me off the meds.	The only problem I have with the medication is that it is expensive--about $5.oo per pil--and that it doesn't always work.  It doesn't always help with jet lag, for instance, and there are other times when I lose half the night anyway, usually in connection with PMDD. It works about 80% of the time.
1195	prozac	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	My mood swings decreased, I was less irritable.  When I would be blue, I would not go into a deeper depression.  It just evened me out.

I had one on one counseling with a therapist.  I have taken 20 mg everyday for the past 12 years.  I have tried other medications but they have not worked nearly as well for me.

3948	prilosec	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	heartburn/gerd	Heartburn was lessened, but new symptoms began (possibly side effects) which made a new set of problems. Severe heartburn occurred 5-7 times a week before treatment, and was brought down to 2-3 times a week during treatment.	Chronic constipation, dry mouth and mild dizziness. The side effects, aside from the constipation were usually mild and went away after treatment was discontinued.	40mg a day of Prilosec were prescribed to me after I complained to my doctor of chronic heartburn symptoms. I began taking it that day, and once every morning there after. Heartburn symptoms began to subside after 2-3 days of taking it. Mild side effects after about a week. The most noticeable and bothersome side effect (constipation) began after about 9 days of treatment. After putting up with it for a week I went to my doctor. He prescribed a mild laxative and suggested I stay on the Prilosec for at least 2 months to get the drugs full benefits. I did, but the constipation was still there (laxatives helped some). The doctor switched me to Nexium, which worked just as well and without the constipation.
2723	elavil	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	chronic headaches	"Since I was very young, a child, I suffered debilatating headaches.  Often they became true migraines.  They would last for days and days, sometimes weeks
without stop.  I missed school, parties, holidays.  I was scared to make plans
to do anything fearing the pain.  I pretty much went to bed with some degree of head pain and woke up with it everyday.  I had no clue what it would be like to
live without them.  Sometime late in 1999 I went to my pharmacy to pick us some
prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered
headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  Her eyes were wide
open,  she seemed happy, etc.  She told me her Doctor had put her on Elavil
and within days her headaches subsided.  I went straight to my pain management
physician and asked for Elavil. Two weeks later I started going whole days
without head pain.  I went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  I looked
forward to doing things.  I woke up without pain.  What a miracle!  I have
probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  When
I do get a slight headache it usually disappears within a short time without
additional meds.  Needless to say my entire life changed. I am a better wife, mother, daughter, friend.  I take the generic and notice no difference from
Elavil.  Thank you Elavil."	None that I noticed.	I take one 150 mg tablet of generic Elavil at bedtime.

1427	adipex-p	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	to lose 30 pounds	"When BMI rating is over 27 its time to get that taken care of before it goes beyond that. I have taken adipex in my 20's and lost 30 pounds in 6 weeks. I keep it off until I turned 43.  You have to exercise or this will not work. I am not a fan of exercising but when you get the burst of energy get up and move. If you are stuck behind a desk.. turn from side to side... do stretches.. then at lunch or break move!!! There are so many looking for the magical drug for weight loss but there is none. Exercise is the magical word.

Not that way at all but it is a aid to get to your goal"	jittery.. sometimes euphoric.. tired but cant sleep.. in a zone.	"last results 3 months on adipex-p lost 30 pounds.

processed meats, dairy is low fat or fat free yogurt. Daily vitamin and lots and lots of water to replenish so you don't get fatigued.  Im on my way.. 5 pounds down and 25 to go. Good luck this can work for most people with no excuses other then a underlying disease .. if so its obvious you shouldn't be taking adipex. Good luck all .. dont get weak. and if you mess up make sure its worth it.. that extra serving dont let it be more then a half cup and only if you can burn it off. Good Luck all and remember don't give up.. don't cheat yourself with extra licks from the brownie bowl.. tasting samples of dinner before serving. those are huge calories not counted for that can ruin your diet. Take care and get moving!!"
262	ultram	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	budging disk in neck	For the most part the pain was taken away just enough that I could function.  I like that it's not a narcotic, yet gives some of the benefits of one.	Because it only took away part of the pain I thought it would be OK to take 2 more tablets.  That was a really bad idea.  I started to feel pressure in my head, I felt like I was going to faint, my lips started to tingle.  The worst effect though was that about 3 min after my heart started going extremely fast then started skipping over and over.  It was very scary.  I then read that a person can die from and overdose.  I feel like I dodged death.  Very important! take this as prescribed.	This med was the drug of choice for me since I am in recovery for alcohol.

I have stopped using this drug altogether after reading the reports.
3292	zoloft	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	head injuries	Due to a car accident I sustained head injuries in addition to physical body injuries (broken bones, etc.)  I had terrible mood swings.  Through the assistance of a Psycharist subscribing Zoloft, gradually I became calmer.  I didn't cry as often for no apparent reason or get irritated at the drop of a hat.  My short term memory returned and I became less self conscious.	Sometimes I experienced a slight ticking in my head as if I had something in my brain clicking all the time.  If I do not take the Zoloft when I get up (later in the day) I get headachs.  No other side effects.	Initial dosage was 50 mg gradually over two year my span dosage increased to 200 mg.  I still am taking Zoloft.  I am somewhat fraid my symptoms will resurface.  I am also concerned about any withdrawals or headachs.

2759	xenical	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	contraception	contraception	For some reason i felt very emotional, much more than before going on the pill. It did not come across as a negative side effect, but I would  cry  on seeing a scenic landscape, not to mention more charged situation.   Similar side effects were described by my friend who also took marvelon.  Moreover, I experienced enhanced libido but, perhaps, it was an effect of reduced worrying over getting pregnant.	I took it daily with with 7-day break each month, during which a period was induced.
2642	pravachol	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	ldl cholesterol	Initial LDL cholesterol reduced from 320 to 230 after 60 days. Continuing to take Pravastatin to further reduce LDL cholesterol.  HDL cholesterol is within normal range. Change in diet and weight reduction as recommended by Doctor is contributing to adjustment of cholesterol levels.	It is undetermined whether Pravastatin is responsible for the muscle pain and diarrhea I am experiencing daily. I had cronic back pain prior to taking Pravastatin and I am now having muscle cramps and significant joint pain.  The chronic diarrhea began in 07/2009 before I started taking Pravastatin and lab testing has not revealed any cause for it.	After taking Pravastatin for 60 days lab tests were performed to test liver function and cholesterol levels. After reviewing the test results I was told to continue taking Pravastatin for another 30 days and then get lab testing done again. My doctor also advised me to exercise more, loose some weight and eat more fruits and vegetables and less dairy and meat.  I have lost 8 pounds and have committed to some regulation of my diet.  I have eliminated eating from fast food restaurants.

After a hospital stay, being treated with IV Solumedrol, for 5 days, and many blood tests etc, my blood work came up with a very elevated ACE level, the doctors now suspect Sarcoidosis, the Neuro put me on 60 MG prednisone daily for 90 days, and in the meantime see the Rheumatoid doc to rule out this condition, the prednisone unfortunately that i am on, makes it very difficult to diagnose, and he wants me to start a taper, to see what happens, and then they can start doing more tests, as Prednisone masks the inflammation that they are looking for 

They also did a bone density test while there, and have discovered i have severe osteoporosis, so really not sure if they are going to get me off this drug pretty fast 

The drug is dangerous to be on and can cause other problems, but my Neuro obviously feels the need to have me on it sure i am scared to be on too long, but i think right now the benefits out weigh the risks"

2288	lexapro	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	The benefits of taking Lexapro, for me, were noticable within a few weeks at the very most. I wasn't as on edge. I wasn't as anxious. I haven't had any more anxiety attacks and Lexapro has helped me.	I did not personally have any side effects from taking Lexapro. I gained 5lbs after starting it, but it was also winter time and I seem to gain 5 pounds around the holidays anyway. No trouble taking it off in the spring so I don't think it was an actual side effect--just too much of the holiday food.	I had never had a panic or anxiety attack before. After having my first one, and being scared to death to have another one, my doctor put me on Lexapro. I take 10mg/ day and have not increased it.
3765	spironolactone	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Acne decreased significantly when used in combination with the antibiotic erythromycin. The addition of spironolactone cleared up the acne that seemed to be triggered by fluctuating hormone levels. It also increased breast size.

Occasional aura (pre-seziure activity which are actually seizures themselves), during high stress, or situations that trigger photosensitivity.

Currently looking online to Canada to try and find the original Albuteral inhaler.

106	celebrex	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	pain	I am an athlete, tennis pro and avid golfer. I experienced inflammation and swelling post knee surgery (tibia plateau fracture). Walking an 18 hole golf course can be painful for me, even after a year post surgery, I was in search of pain relief to continue playing a sport I love. Celebrex reduced my inflammation and stiffness and allowed me to play pain free.	So far I have experienced no side effects. I have had no bad or serious reactions. I have not had any intestinal pains, diarhhea or nausea that I have heard are common side effects that are associated with taking this drug. I have not even had an upset stomach.	I have been taking Celebrex now for over five months. I am very pleased with the drug it has helped to relieve my stiffness and pain with no bad side effects. I was concerned about taking this drug on a daily basis or extended term but my experience with no side effects has lowered my concern. I will continue to take it as I do see a difference when I don't, my knee is more stiff and difficult to walk at times. I have tried naproxen but for me celebrex works better.
2146	zyrtec	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	severe allergies	When I started taking Zyrtec I had severe sore throat pain that I thought might be strep throat.  It turned out to be environmental allergies.  While I was taking Claritin for about a year, it wasn;t having any effect on these allergies.	When I first started taking it, I would get drowsy.  I started splitting the pill in half and taking them about 12 hours apart and this seemed to help.  Also I noticed a drastic decrease in alcohol tolerance.	I took a half of a 10 mg Zyrtec tablet 2X a day for about 2 months.  I do not have health insurance and could not get a refill.

I was always forgetful, but now after taking it a few days, I nearly never forget anything. And I remember the material covered in class.	"Few side effects, BUT...the few that I did have were quite severe. The biggest and worst effect was the constant chewing, mostly without noticing. As I said before, I'm spontaneous. And my spontaneous self had decided to buy a pacifier shortly before my doctors appointment where I was prescribed Vyvanse. After taking the vyvanse,I felt the sudden urge to chew, on anything ane everything, including the pacifier, my fingers, my cell phone, and the worst, my cheeks. I could feel the pain of chewing my cheeks, and I could taste the blood, but I didn't know what caused it. I didn't know that I was chewing my cheeks at that point. By the end of that day, I had chewed both cheeks, my tongue, and the right side of my top lip quite badly. It also made me lose all intrest in eating, and I love to eat, and I need to eat. (85 lbs. 5'1"") after school, I knew that I had to eat, and spent over 30 minutes eating a single cookie."	"On 9/18/11 I was prescribed (30) 30mg Vyvanse for ADHD to take every morning. It had common side effects on me, such as loss of appetite, severe chewing, and I ""geeked out"" pretty bad.

I sought treatment for frequent severe migrains. I started getting migraines at age 30 and in recent months had been having 2-3 migrains a week. I was taking Imitrex at the initial sign of a migrain (eye aura) but this was had limited effectiveness. My doctor recommended trying Topamax. In the first 2 months I had 2 migrains and have only had 4 in the last 18 months. I take 100mg at bed because it makes very relaxed and sleep very deeply. I very occasionally find myself forgetting nouns and proper names but that has been the only cognitive effect. I still have been able to be effective and focused at my job.
3245	nuvaring	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	birth control	None	Within 2 months, I developed deep vein thrombosis in my left leg and pulmonary emboli in my lungs. Multiple blood clots in my lungs almost killed me. I was lucky to live because the clot lodged in parts of my lungs that were not fatal.	Doctor inserted the NuvaRing during the office visit.

At the very least, the symptoms of glucoma immediately improved to normal and have remained at the normal range."	Longer eye lashes, darker eyes, slight eye irritation.	I have been very satisfied with the results of taking lumigan. My eye pressure was in the mid 20's and has dropped to the mid teen's. As an experiment, I stopped taking lumigan for several months and my pressure went back up over 20, so I went back on lumigan and it again dropped to the mid teen's. The preferred range of eye pressure is 10 to 20, with 15 or below considered to be optimal.
2539	lamisil	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	fungal toenails	None	after the 4th dose, I had blurred and double vision. I had to go and be evaluated by an opthalmologist, family practioner, and a neurologist since they thought my blurred vision was a result of something else. I was prescribed glasses, had to have extensive testing and FINALLY after 3-1/2 weeks, my normal vision return. I contacted the pharmacy, the drug manufacturer, the FDA and a toxicologist and none were able to tell me how long the side effects would last. I am grateful to have my sight back but this drug should not be on the market if even only 1& of the population can have visual disturbances...It was hell to not see clearly and have to submit to so many tests and be so dependent on others for getting around. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION!	None
635	seasonique	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control	Very effective at preventing pregnancy.  Also regulated menstrual cycle length and helped relieve acne.  The best part is that you only menstruate 4 times a year, as opposed to 12 or 13.	During the first two months or so that I was on Seasonique, I experienced rather severe depression and uncontrollable mood swings.  I also had issues with breast swelling and tenderness.  I spoke with my doctor and he advised me that such side effects, although very uncommon, almost always wore off after the first few months.  I decided to stick it out and sure enough, they wore off as my body grew accustomed to the medication.	You take one pill every day, preferably at around the same time.
3057	isoniazid	7	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	tuberculosis	While I did not have active Tuberculosis, I had tested positive.  Taking Isoniazid will prevent a future case of Tuberculosis from developing.	None, although liver screenings were required, and I could not drink alcohol.  I also was encouraged to take B12 supplements.	After testing positive for Tuberculosis, my Dr. prescribed a 6 month course of Isoniazid.
1975	lyrica	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pain in my legs	relieved the pain	swelling, weight gain, fatigue	I was prescibed lyrica for pain in the leg.  It was caused by an impinged nerve in my back.  Since weight gain was a side effect of the medicine, although it did releive my pain, it made it harder for the swelling in my back to go down.  In the end, I came off lyrica and immediately dropped 20 pounds and the nerve was no longer impinged.
1347	crestor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high colesteral	Lowered my colesteral from 225 to 156.  Excellant results	No side effects that I am aware of.	Take a pill once a day
4054	amoxil	8	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	a boil	the instructed me that by taking the antibiotic, it would surround the bacterias thus preventing further spread if the infections to other body parts.it really worked except that a nodule was left at the site of the boil. however, the drug gave me severe stomach aches due to gastritis before i went back to the physician to get some antiacids.	anti acids	i was required to take drug for seven days. i only took it for 5 days and it still worked
3868	levoxyl	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypothyroid	Initially I had Graves, then became hypothryoid post-treatment.  While hypothyroid I gained weight, had hair loss, was fatigued, cold and miserable.  Getting on a correct dose of thyroid replacement is great.  My hair returned, I became more fit and active.	When on too much levothyroxine I was jittery, had weight loss and was emotional.  If I had too little I had difficulty with bloating and fatigue.  It was certainly a drug that had to be monitored and adjusted based on lab levels and side effects.	I began replacement with 250mcg each day.  I rather quickly had difficulty with rapid heart rate, dry hair and skin, emotionalness that wasn't true to me.  It took several months of monitoring blood levels of thyroid hormone, monitoring syptoms and adjusting doses to find a right dose for me.  I've been stable on my current dose for 3 years.
301	mirena	3	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	birth control	the treatment benefits were that i did not get pregnant nor did i get a period. occasional spotting but nothing a pantiliner couldn't handle.	the side effects are individual and unfortunately you don't know which ones will effect you the most. my personal side effects were horrible acne, weight gain, hair loss, extreme irritability.	"just like with any iud you wait for your menstrual cycle to start and have the device inserted then. this was three months after my children were born. approximately one month later i started noticing that my skin was starting to break out really bad, especially on my mid face down, neck, chest and back. i was getting very large cysts which i never had even as a kid. normal zits every now and then but never ones that would leave a scar. when treatments and products wouldn't help i called my obgyn and they told me that was ""a common side effect, sorry."" well over the course of the next few months i stopped getting a period but would know when my period should've been here because my mood swings were out of control. i would get so angry over nothing. and the next day i would get some cramping. i started keeping track of this and realized that these episodes were happening about every four weeks or so. i also have never felt so bloated and swollen in my life. i sometimes wake up and my fingers don't have any lines on the knuckles. exercise helps this, but i still can't seem to lose those ""last 10"" pounds. i've spoken to other women who have similiar if not worse effects than me. but the consensus is always that something negative happened after they got it."
3537	xanax-xr	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety rapid onset	"Xanax XR .5 once daily for 2 days. This med works within 20-30 mins. A good solution for fast anxiety relief, as opposed to waiting 2 weeks for it to ""settle"" into your system. I think I might have done fine with .25 instead of the .50.

However, just reading about other people's anxiety accounts and Xanax has given me anxiety!"	"A wee lethargic, but welcome feeling compared to... you know dying and hyperventilating. :) Definately tired. Maybe some minor bowel disturbances.

I am concerned about withdrawal so plan to take it on an as needed basis only!"	Xanax XR .5 once daily for 2 days now.
1828	yasmin	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	cure for acne	Well i started having acne by the age of 18, but it wasnt like normal acne,big and red, it would only stay on the surface of the skin and it was white,it was like little dots all over my face.I used all the creams you could imagine but none of them worked,or would work for a few days and the pimples would come back again. I went to this dermatologist and he said that what could be causing my acne is the hormones balance, (if you have too much feminine or masculine hormones it can cause acne)so he said i could try to take birth control pill to balance my hormones. and so i started. In the first month my acne got worse,but i still kept taking Yasmin(birth control pill), on the third month i started noticing that my skin was clearing from all those pimples.I have been taking it for more than 6 months now and i have no acne! sometimes one or two comes out but it goes away in 2 days.So Yasmin worked for me and could work for you too!	I always had bad blood circulation so i would feel my legs a little bit swallow!	"1 pill everyday at the same time.
Even if in the first months you see that your acne is getting worse, dont stop taking it till the forth month.you will se the difference."
2714	omnitrope	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	hgh deficiency & hiv	skin seems to be producing more collagen and DEFINITELY has better texture and appearance. The low dose of HGH is something that needs to be considered as it really border a theraputic level. The bad side is the cost...500 per month at 1 cc per day. For men I cant tell you how happy I am with the low dose testosterone / Nandrolone (Deca) combination ( 100 mg per week). And generally speaking isnsurance companies DO cover injectable testosterone.	none	see above
3574	differin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	I have noticed a reduction in acne breakouts, particularly painful cysts.  I have also noticed improved skin appearance with more even skin tone.	I initially experienced mild facial redness, which lasted the first three days of treatment.	I apply Differin gel once per day to treat facial acne.  I have noticed a considerable reduction in acne breakouts.
310	protopic	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	vaginal eczema	none	IT BURNS SO BAD!!!!!! ITCHING AND BURNING LIKE MY WORST ECZEMA NIGHTMARE! LIKE A HEATING PAD HAS BEEN LEFT ON MY BARE SKIN ON HIGH HEAT FOR A LONG TIME. I paid over $100 for this and I don't think I can go through with this to see if it gets better. Not twice a day, I'm miserable right now from putting on for the first time this morning - 2 hours ago and it still is hurting, burning, itching, on fire! I'd take caution when applying this, only do a very small area and do it when you don't have to work or go to school. FML	Absolutely not following through with it.
2248	zovirax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	Zovirax is a highly effective treatment of cold sores.  I take it in significantly higher dosages than the package indicates and 70% of the time, the cold sore diseappear within a day.	I have never experienced any side effects	I basically take at least 5 200 mg tablets.  I have not found the ointment to be effective at all, only the tablets.
1330	prevacid	5	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	acid reflex	supposed to stop acid reflex, which it did for 2 days	congestion and pressure within 2 hours after taking the morning dose on the 3rd day.	I will be taking Omeprazole, as I have been doing for years.. took Prilosec before the generic was available.   Prevacid contains only 15 mg of acid reducer whereas the other two contain 20 mg.  Yet you are charging as much as the others, and giving the customer 25% less.
2711	prometrium	4	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	perimenopause symptoms	"Decrease in panic attacks (maybe these were hot flashes ... but didn't feel ""hot""). Woke up less often at night from these same panic attacks."	Still have headaches - not clear if these are from my sinuses or a side effect, but they have been persistent. Always had problems with sleep, so am not sure if that is affected by the Prometrium.	"oral medication - presumably the same substance that is found in topical ""natural"" progesterone cream."
2633	depo-provera	5	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	birth control	"it's admittedly very good at preventing pregnancy...
because well...it kinda stops the urge to have it."	constant back and stomach cramps,breakthrough bleeding(really often),it made my interest in sex really really low because I developed dyspareunia(painful intercourse) and it made me avoid sex which made me considerably depressed..and depression may or may not be a side effect..but it definitely was a thing.	"one shot every 4 months,it's fairly painless...
it's a great form of contraceptive.
because it basically makes you abstinent..the side effects just aren't worth it."
4140	percocet	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	pain	The pill was very effective and i felt the relief from the pain considerably right after taking the pill	This medication does cause drowsiness, and dizziness as it says on the label.  Rest is a must while taking this medication.  Its better if you do not drive and perform intensive activities right after taking this medication.  It is a very strong medication and since I have a petite physique, I did think that the dose was a bit too high for me.  I felt very light headed and drowsy after taking th epill but i must say the pill does do its job.	The pill was prescribed to me for recovering from pain after my wisdom teeth were extracted.  It was a very effective pain killer.  All of my wisdom teeth were extracted the same day and I was in excruciating pain once the anesthetic wore off.  As soon as I took thi smedication, I felt great relief.  I was prescribed only 5 pills but I felt much better after taking only 3, 1 every 4 hours.
1599	xanax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety/trouble sleeping	Reduces anxiety/worry. Really relaxes me and makes me feel much better and lets me sleep. I had major trouble falling asleep before taking this drug. Now I sleep like a baby. Very effective. Taken as prescribed there are no problems. A few idiots abuse this drug and thus the drug has gotten a bad rap unfortunately. Much better than SSRI's with way less side effects. It really makes me feel great. I take the .5 mg fast acting version, not the long acting version. This way it clears my system quicker and I can take it as needed and not worry about tolerance.	None.	.5 mg/day as needed
1764	topamax	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	epilepsy	I started Topamax right after approval due to ongoing generalized (Grand mal) seizures that were resistant to other drugs. My epileptologist was hoping this would be the one. We added it on to what I was currently taking at the time (tegratol and dilantin) and crossed our fingers. Guess what? After reaching 400mg a day- I went from having 3-4 generalized seizures A WEEK, to 3 TOTAL in many many years! Unfortunately, I continued having partial complex seizures until we found the Dilantin/Lamictal/Topamax combo (in the last 3 years) and I still have 1 or 2 of those a month.  I really owe my life to topamax. AWESOME drug. Awesome awesome awesome.	"In the beginning I remember getting ""topatingles"" or tingling in my fingers (that hurt sometimes), toes, and even my lips. I lost a lot of weight and have stayed in the underweight category ever since. My memory vanished (I affectionately nicknamed this drug ""stupimax"" and ""Dopamax""), I got strange aches and pains in my bones, joints, and muscles. I was more sensitive to the sun and heat and my sweat was reduced. I frequently had a runny nose and cough. Food tasted funny. Sex felt different (not bad- just different) my skin was  very sensitive to touch and my hearing was overactive. My potassium kept testing deficient and I had to be prescribed supplements. My hair also fell out in clumps!

All that went away or got better with some time. I also found out WHY it was happening- I was malnourished. Once I started drinking 56-80oz of water a day, taking a multivitamin + biotin (for the hair issue!), eating potassium rich foods and a more healthy diet all of a sudden the side effects started to vanish. 

I still have dilantin side effects which are easy to distinguish as I've been on that since 1985, but the topamax ones are gone barring once and awhile I have a bit of 'loss of words' while speaking. I love this drug."	I take one 200mg tab in the morning and one 200mg tab in the evening. I take the brand name topamax as the generic one caused my blood levels to dive a bit and I had a breakthrough seizure. Too bad as the generic is much cheaper.
1102	effexor	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	helped the depression initially, was far more positive during the years I took it, but the efficacy of the drug began to deteriate, and the onset of new side effects led me to try to live without the treatment	initially, not many, some loss of concentration when driving longer than half hour periods, eyes felt very heavy, and it felt like part of my brain had shut down, struggled not to fall to sleep. after some time, about six years, I started to get night sweats, very uncomfortable, and mood swings. I thought it might be hormaonal, but after taking away the drug , the symptoms alleviated.	I now feel that I have suffered fibromyalgia for a long time, and part of the reason I was depressd was I found it hard to deal with the pain i was feeling at the time, I had two very young children , and was not diagnosed with a condition . If I had understood my condition better, I may have managed the fibromyalgia better. I was pushing my body too hard, as I felt frustrated t not managing everything better, and the cycle of depression continued. I have come off the venlafaxine, and the symptoms of pain, particularly in the morning have returned, but I can manage them better, knowing it is not symptomatic of a seriously damaging condition, and that it is 'normal' for me. I pace myself better, and no longer have the demands of very young children , so can do that easier. I like being 'drug' free, although I do supplement with fish oils and 5 HTP
908	paxil	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	depression	No treatment benefits	A million, shaking like crazy, jaw clenching practically breaking my teeth, jaw chattering, felt like I was watching myself, insomnia, blurred vision, confusion, couldn't stop thinking, can't stay still.	For depression take 20mg once a day. Will now come off and try another. Didn't work for me.

I feel much better than I do on days I don't take it.	none	I take it once in 3 days.  I would love to take it every day.  I sometimes take Rozerem the other 2 days but it isn't near as effective.
3214	cataflam	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	lower back pain	It eliminated the pain in my lower back for 8 hours at a time and after taking the full corse it seemed to have reduced the inflammation causing the pain.	I noticed no side effects, other than a one time stomach ache. This medication is associated with stomach problems when taken for longer periods, but the longest I used it was 7 days.	I took this medication for 7 days for lower back pain, 2 times a day.
2970	niaspan	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	cholesterol problems	"My cholesterol levels were terrible.  I was around 32 years old with, as the doctor said, ""the cholesterol of a 40 year old man.""  It may have been partly due to my crohn's disease (which was flaring) and the weird way my body was absorbing nutrients at the time. Over the past 4 years my HDL levels have been significantly higher, and my overall cholesterol has moved into the acceptable zone (though not as good as I wish it was)!"	Niaspan is a high dose of Niacin (vitamin B) and causes a good amount of flushing at a dose of 1000mg.  My cholesterol levels were screwy, and I had a more holistic doctor at the time.  She wanted to avoid drugs that she considered more harsh.  I was instructed to take the dose right before I went to bed.  I took the first dose about an hour before bed, and I turned beet red with the most amazing full-body flush.  Skin on my arms, torso, chest, neck and face was flushed.  I was really hot and really uncomfortable.  I went to lay down and try to sleep, but I couldn't get comfortable.  It was embarrassing because we had a guest staying with us at the time!  After about 15-20 minutes the flush subsided, and I was able to fall asleep.  So it is important to literally take the pill as you're getting into bed.  I've noticed some flushing sort of subconsciously while I'm asleep, but it generally doesn't wake me up.	I started with 1000mg and stayed at that level for about 2 years.  Then, after I moved and changed doctors, my dose was reduced to 500mg/night.  My liver stats were being monitored because of another medication I was taking (mercaptopurine), so I'm relatively sure I haven't had any adverse liver effects with this drug.
3385	baclofen	9	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	muscle pain and stiffness due to fibromyalgia	"Significant reduction in cramping, stiffness, and ""knots"" in muscles."	Drowsiness, somewhat impaired balance	"I was prescribed Baclofen with a number of other drugs to treat muscle and joint pain and stiffness due to fibromyalgia.  When I first began taking the medication, I slept ALL the time--as much as 22 hours a day.  I literally could not stay awake.  This may have been due not only to the drug's sedating affect, but to the vast sleep deficit of that years of pain and insomnia had produced.  As time went on, I slept less, and was less dependent on the Baclofen as a ""maintenance"" medication--I began to ""save"" it to take in slightly more concentrated doses when a severe muscle spasm or strain, or a ""flare"" occurs, which happens frequently in fibromyalgia patients.  I have noticed that the drug is less effective than it used to be, requiring higher doses to treat the same level of stiffness or cramping."

260	ultram	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	neck pain	Tramadol was prescribed for severe neck pain due to a bone spur that had grown into a nerve root in my neck. It was the only drug that could give me any relieve before I had surgery to fuse the vertebrae between C6 and C7 in my neck. It did not eliminate the pain completely, but made it very tolerable.	I had and still continue to have few side side effects. I had a decrease in appetite.	I took 1 to 2 tablets three times a day prior to surgery. After surgery I took and continue to take 1 to 2 pills a day as needed.
4034	tri-luma	3	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	melasma	My melasma improved considerably, which speaks to the efficacy of the treament because I only used it for 7 days.	My skin started flaking all over my face (not just on the application sites). The flaking is similar to normal dry skin symptoms. I also developed very minor scabby areas below my eyes, just above the cheek application site. The corners of my mouth turned red and became irritated, which was annoying and unbecoming.	I basically bought Tri Luma to treat a cosmetic issue. It helped relieve the problem a bit, but it created additionaly cosmetic problems. I am more embarrassed by the redness at my mouth than I am by the discoloration...actually, I don't know which is worse. I do not know if I would recommend the product to those with normal skin, but I would definitely not recommend it to those with sensitive skin.

2419	synthroid	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	Although the medication has decreased my TSH level, I am still fatigued and inspite of being active at my job, I cannot seem to lose weight.  I have extememly low energy level which I thought the synthroid would help.	None that I'm aware of.	I take one table, once a day with water.
3219	copaxone	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	mulitple sclerosis	"No exacerbations since starting during summer of 2008 after 11 years on Avonex (another ""disease modifying medications"" for MS."	"Redness, itching, sometimes swelling at injection site and mild soreness.  All are brief in duration. I have never experienced the flushing described by ""49 year old female"" either, but Shared Solutions will inform you about it so you will be prepared should it happen.

I like to consider it in the same way I did Avonex for all those years; it sucks, but it keeps me on my toes and therefore worth it."	"Very simple once you establish a simple routine.  ""Shared Solutions"", the company behind Copaxone provides you with everything you need for each injection, including; in home injection training, which I was able to get down with just one session, but they will come as often as you need.

You load an injection tool with a syringe.  Remove the cap from the syringe (simple).  Wipe the inection site with a kind of cheap, provided alcohol wipe.  Let the alcohol dry (30-60) seconds.  Place the tip of the tool on the injection site, press a button and the tool injects the shot in about 7-15 seconds.  It varies.  Yeah, I called them cheap alcohol wipes, but they are good enough and I'm picky.  I buy my own because they are inexpensive.

Most important as stated earlier by ""49 year old female"" rotate the injection sites.  Rotate, Rotate, Rotate.  No tissue damage for me so far from Copaxone, but minor damage from Avonex on leg.  Rotate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Shared Solutions offers great support via the phone or website.  I used them a bit in the beginning, but not much since, but I do know that they are available until late evening with knowledgeable, understanding and sensitive ""NURSES"". They deserve the ""Atta Boy-Girl"" this paragraph took up."
3026	seroquel	9	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar disorder	Mood was more stable. Better quality of sleep.	For the first few days of the use of Seroquel I had very bad nightmares. My nighmares felt so real that I almost stopped taking the medication. After about two day the nightmare just turned into very vivid dreams... sometimes very pleasant dreams. Seroquel also makes me urinate more often so I drink more water to stay hydrated.	I was diagnosed with PTSD after several negative incidents happened in my life. There was a point when I felt like I was going to crawl out of my skin. The doctor started me on Seroquel... a very high dose at first, 300mg. Later when I found out about some of it's very negative side effects such as TD, I started taking only 100mg a night. And soon I will try to lower that dosage.
2538	lamisil	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	toenail fungus	I received no benefit from the medication.  My prescribing physician told me it would take a full six months of this medication taken daily for it to be effective.  That's not going to work for me.	Total loss of taste and rapidly diminishing sense of smell.  Very bad taste in my mouth.  Feels like I'm sucking on a dirty copper penny all the time.  After one week of enduring the loss of my sense of taste and smell, I stopped taking the medication.  It's only been 2 days and these two senses have not yet returned, but I'm hopeful they will eventually.	I contacted my pharmacist and she researched the Terbinafine I was taking and told me it could very well be what was causing this problem.  Since I had no idea what else it could be, I stopped taking it on my own.  I then contaced my physician and gave her the details and she agreed that stopping it would be wise at this point.  We are hoping that this is what the problem is and that my sense of taste and smell will return.  We just don't know when it will happen.  Very unpleasant experience, I must say.
4132	chantix	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	smoking	I feel that Chantix is the best way to quit smoking. It was prescribed my my doctor. I smoked for 30 years. The only time I quit during that 30 years was when I was pregnant. I always started back up within a year. This time I know I won't start smoking again.	I had no treatment side effects at all. The evening pill did make me drousy but that is mentioned on the prescription. It a good thing because people sometimes does not sleep well when they are trying to quit or do quit smoking.	It was the best treatment I could have chose. I am very satisfies with the treatment. It has worked for me. It started having an effect on me the 2nd day of treatment. I noticed the cigarettes tasted bad so I keep putting them out. And I quit before the first week of being on the Chantix.
1581	xanax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	panic disorder	It help me get through the day with out a fast heartbeat. It calmed my nerves.	I was very drowsy during the first few weeks.  But that went away after a while.	I started taking Xanax in 1984 at the age of 33. I have a Mitral Valve Prolapse.  I am one of the few people who has problems with it.  Right before I started taking xanax, I was in and out of the emergency room with heartbeats up to 200 beats per minute.  My heart doctor put me on Lanoxin and inderal to control heartbeat, and gave me Lorazopam for nerves.  The Lorazopam did not do me any good.  I was still having fast heartbeat attacks.  He then referred me to a psychiatrist who put me on Xanax.  My panic attacks stopped for the most part. I started out on .5 mg 3 times per day, and dropped down to .5 mg 1 time per day a few years later, as I was able to cope better with less.   Today, I no longer take any medications at all.  I withdrew from Xanax in 2003.  I am doing fine.  I have gone to a natural approach.
3410	aricept	4	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	memory	I believe I noticed some improvement in retaining information from conversations as well as from reading,including,but not limited to, books, magazines, newspapers. I also think I was clearer with regard to remembering events -the event itself, as well as the order in which things occurred in the particular event.	Initially, I noticed no side effects. However, after taking it for approximately three weeks I began with nausea. I assumed I had caught a 'bug' & continued taking the med. Going into the fourth week the nausea became more pronounced & came intermittently throughout the day & evening. Additionally,the nausea was intermittently accompanied by a mild headache.	My doctor prescribed Aricept to aid my memory difficulties following a serious car accident in which I sustained multiple injuries, including a head injury. I do not recall events correctly, nor do I recall them in proper sequence. I have great difficulty remembering things;ex: If I have something on the stove I must stay with it; if I walk away I become distracted & completely forget I have something on the stove; I forget where I put things;if I am given instructions on something, they must be written down, as I cannot recall them or recall them correctly. Some past events are forgotten or foggy.
1851	augmentin	5	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	cat bite infection	The infection cleared	Loss of appetite, heartburn, nausea,light headed feeling, gas, bloating,did not sleep well, 2 episodes of extreme dizziness  (side-effects were most extreme at mid-point - 5 days.  About 7-10 after completion I developed a vaginal yeast infection, which was cleared with over the counter medication.	The cat bite on my foot was very swollen and painful.  I was hospitalized for 4 days, during which time antibiotics were administered intravenously every 6 hours.  When I was discharged from the hospital I felt fine, without any of the symptoms described above.   When I started taking the Augmentin there were very few side-effects - they became very noticeable after the 5th or 6th day.  By the end of the treatment, the dizziness had subsided as did the light headed feeling, but the intestinal discomfort remained until 3 or 4 days after.

Vicodin is only taken when i experience headaches which i am told has nothing to do with my perenniel rhinitis... It works best if I take it as soon as i experience the apparent signs of a headache.. then, i don't usually have to continue taking it at the prescribed dosages of every 4 to six hours.. i have been taking vicodin or the generic for more than 10 years...i do not take in at night because it seems to cause insomnia."
3104	ortho-tri-cyclen	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	The treatment benefits were clearly protection from getting pregnant as long as the pill is taken regularly without skipping. This pill is also touted as being one that helps in the treatment of acne, although I honestly can't say that it changed my acne pattern whatsoever. I tend to break out around the time of my monthly cycle, and I continued to break out even during the time I was on this pill. I didn't notice any decrease in my break-outs.	The only side effect I noticed was a diminished sex drive.	I was told to start the monthly dosage on the first Sunday following the cessation of my period. I then continued taking one pill a day to prevent pregnancy.
101	celebrex	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	arthritis	the benefits of taking Celebrex have been to reduce the inflamation caused by arthritis and degenerative arthritis. I have noticed releif from the soreness and stiffness that comes with this problem. Other than that I don't know what else I can tell you about this drug. Since there are fewer drugs available for this problem that are effective it has also been shown to be safe.	The only side effects of takibg this drug are some stomach irritation. I have found that if I take it with food it helps. The manufacturers of this drug claim that there are no side effects involving the stomach but I would disagree with this claim.	"I have been taking Celebrex for over 5 years. As it is an expensive drug I probably would not be taking it unless it werew provided free by my doctor. I notice that I feel much better when I have been taking it for a few days but because of the side effect of stomach irritation I usually have to stop taking it for a few days to let me stomach return to normal.
Hope this helps your survey."

I went to my family physician  knowing that this was probably due to onset of menopause.  It took about a month for the symptoms to abate.  I stayed on Prompro for ten years.  I stopped taking Prempro one month ago, mainly due to evidence of direct correlations between HRT use and increasing probability of breast cancer occurence.  I am now concerned over decreasing health of my skin because I am no longer on HRT.

About five years ago, I started to get acne pimples and bumps on my cheeks and forehead which was diagnosed as rosacea. I was prescribed Metrogel which cleared the problems, including the dry skin. Symptoms reduced almost immediately. I've had about two years without having to get a repeat prescription, and symptoms have just begun to return, so I've requested more from my doc.

2787	wellbutrin	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression-anxiety	Benefits included decreased anxiey attacks.  It took approximately 2 weeks to see results but after that time it was a noticable difference.	The main side effect is dizziness.  For example just sitting and then the room begins to spin.  This only began to happen when I started the medication.  Also I would not advise stopping the medication all of a sudden.  When this happened I began to have terrible headaches, became very dizzy and moody even more so than when I began the medication.	The plan for this treatment was to decrease the frequency and intensity of anxiety attacks.  Medication combined with counseling has helped improve the situation.  When I went off the medication it was only for a short period of time and then I realized it was necessary to go back onto the medication because of the benefits.
1212	prozac	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	"I have taken this drug off and on for 20 years. It is so effective for my depression that I start feeling like I'm ""cured"" and don't need to take it any more. I have found that when I stop taking it, I'll be fine for a few days or weeks, and then I start feeling symptoms of depression again. For the last 3 years, I have taken it regularly and am not planning on stopping. It doesn't make me feel happy every day, because that's not its purpose, however it does keep me from entering a depressive state."	I have not felt any side effects. I know other people feel loss of libido, but I did not suffer this pre-menopause. I have lost some libido since menopause, which is what I attribute it to.	I take 20 mg every morning with my vitamins. For 2 years I took 40 mg every other day, however I haven't felt the need to do this anymore.
4058	amoxil	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	throat infection	sore throat went away, cough cleared up; maybe it would have anyway, but at the time it seemed wisest to avoid getting a worse lung infection than letting it heal itself.	stomach upset, nausea	Took drug as directed. It was a big pill, hard to swallow, especially with sore throat. I was pretty miserable though, and could have goten much sicker if I hadn't treated this infection.

1182	prozac	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	this anti-depressant has basically saved my life.  i have suffered with severe depression and anxiety since childhood.  whether these problems were caused by 'nature or nurture' can be difficult to ascertain, but in my particular case, i believe it was both.  while i was a victim of severe sexual, physical and verbal abuse from a very young age through my teen years, i also seem to have been born with an unusually 'sensitive' disposition, and can get very emotionally and mentally disturbed at times with very little provocation.  everyone who knows me well considers me a very emotional person.  at any rate, it has been the prozac that has helped me in dealing with the stresses of even everyday life.  i first started feeling suicidal in adolescence, and unfortunately, this is still a constant problem.  the prozac, i am convinced, has helped me keep these feelings in check, and although i was just hospitalized for my depression late last year, i am still alive and kicking.  i completely believe that it is the prozac that has saved my life.  before the advent of these types of antidepressants, all that was available were the tricyclics.  those never worked for me the way the ssri's have.  although they did achieve in putting me into a stupor-like condition, they never seemed to alleviate my depression.  the prozac does.  while it doesn't rid me of the problem completely, it has been absolutely invaluable to me, and i believe it is the main reason i am alive to write these words to you today.  i am fortunate in that i have never had a single side effect from the prozac.  actually, there has been a complete loss of libido, which could be a major problem for alot of people;  for me, however, this is not a problem, because i am celibate, and have been for 20 years.  trust me, i had enough sex in my younger years to last me for the rest of my life.  i feel i should mention that i have known many people who take prozac and who have not had any sexual problems at all.	initial dosage was 20 mgs. each morning.  this dosage was sufficient for about 5 years, at which point it was raised to 40 mgs. each day.  ultimately, the dosage was raised again approximately 2-3 years after the first increase to my current dosage of 60 mgs. each day.  this is apparently the maximum dosage.  only side effect was loss of libido.	basically you need to see a psychiatrist as often as your condition requires.  i also recommend concurrent visits with some type of therapist or counselor, as this will increase the benefits you receive by taking the medication.
3848	voltaren	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	severe knee pain	My knee and leg pains lessened considerably after taking Voltaren orally	I didn't experience any side effects	By over exercising I strained my left knee which had been a problem in the past(12 years ago,torn meniscus).

I took Voltaren orally as instructed on the packet and it worked within a very short time and after one week the pain is very slight just a twinge now & then in my groin which reminds me that I need to rest!
3760	spironolactone	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Reduced acne significantly and quickly.  I had severe cystic acne for about 3-4 months before trying spiro.

3372	lipitor	2	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	cholesterol	"It lowered the cholesterol levels overall but it is hard to tell if it was really necessary as numbers picked for ""normal"" ranges seem rather arbitrary. some people naturally produce more cholesterol."	"Severely damaged liver therefore impairing the ability of the body to eliminate toxins adequately.
As such is most likely the cause for the Parkinson disease that established recently."	A standard treatment with lipitor was followed with regular visits to doctor for checkup.

147	zmax	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	bronchitis	The medicine kept the illness from getting worse, my cough loosened up immediately.  The dose and length of treatment was very managable, it was easy to remember to take one dose each day.  The packaging is very convenient - a blister pack so you know immediately how many you have taken.	I experienced some mild stomach upset a few hours after taking the first dose (a combined dose totalling 500 mg.)	6 pills taken over 5 days - 2 pills first day, one each day after.
2789	wellbutrin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	freedom from depression, in addition, a greater interest in  sex	none	I took 150mg daily

Positive effects outweigh the side effects experienced at first	Metformin taken at breakfast and again at dinner time. Regular exercise and watching the diet also helps in the regulation of blood glucose.
1797	citalopram	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	major depressive disorder/ anxiety	I was unable to get out of bed or see my friends. I hated going out to parties, going to class, or just interacting with people in general. After taking Celexa I found myself jumping out of bed in the morning and feeling ready to start my day. I started going out more on the weekends and my grades improved significantly. I was happy again and I felt like my life was getting back to how it was before I became depressed.	For the first month I had considerable nausea and headaches but those went away. The lasting effects however were dry mouth and dry eyes. I do experience the initial side effects whenever I increase my dose. I have also lost a lot of weight, about 15 pounds, due to the nausea and food aversion I experience from this medication.	My psychiatrist put me on a low dose in October 2009 (20mg) which increased to 40 mg in two months. I am now currently taking 50 mg and it is working great.
3922	nexium	2	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acid reflux	The stop of acid relux symptoms.  The stop of uncomfortable feelings in my esphogus.  The burning feeling and sensation.  Able to eat what i want when i want.	my stomach cramps up from the medicine.  I also seem to be unable to handle beef products and milk.  My stomach is not digesting them since being on nexium.  I also experience head aches as it is one of the side effects.	I am to take one a day every night before i go to bed so i don't experience acid reflux during the night.  Which is a common time for the acid to come up in my esphogus and damage it.
3611	retin-a	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	whiteheads	After using the Retin A for several months I did notice a decrease in the amount of whiteheads on my checks. My skin seemed to appear brighter and my complexion was not as splotchy. While I did not get any more whiteheads, it did not completely remove the ones I had.	The worst side effect was the burning sensation I experienced during the first few weeks. The area that was affected was around my mouth. I started to put less in that area and the burning cessation decreased. I had some minor flaking, but not a lot.	I put the cream on every night for 8 months. My dermatologist told me that the Retin A should help to unclog my pores. By continuing the Retina A I just sgould not have any new whitheads form.
2795	wellbutrin	3	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	stop smoking	"The treatment was effective in reducing my ""appetite"" for smoking.  It also reduced my appetite for everything, including food.  Therefore, at first, I did manage to stop smoking WITHOUT gaining weight or being depressed about giving up the cigerates.  It just didn't seem important."	"After a while, I began to notice that NOTHING seemed important to me.  I also seemed to be moving in a world that had slowed down considerably.  That may sound good, at first, but the reality was that the only thing that had slowed down was ME--the rest of the world kept going as usual.  I began to notice that I couldn't seem to develop a sense of urgency even when it was IMPORTANT to do so because I had lost my sense of ""timing.""  I tended to be late everywhere I went, I couldn't complete assignments on time, and my sleeping time increased dramatically."	I was taking the Bupropion as an aide to break my smoking habit.  I was also using prescription nicotene patches in decreasing amounts.  The treatment WAS effective in TEMPORARILY breaking the smoking habit and possibly could have had longer lasting effects, however, my skin had a reaction to the patches (I started developing large, red, hot circles everywhere they touched my skin) and I found that I could not effectively lead my day-to-day life while under the influence of the Bupropion. Once I stopped using both products, I slowly returned to smoking.
1151	byetta	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	obesity and diabetes	I initially had severe cramping and nausea, but I continued under doctor's orders, I only lost about 20 pounds, tops.  I now have a larger host of problems I believe were started with this medication.  I have not used in 3 years.	Severe cramping, headaches, incredible nausea, muscle cramps, vomiting blood (not once but on 2 occasions due to doctor's orders).  I now am facing something wrong with my digestive tract and no doctor has been able to figure out what is wrong.  Since this is the area where the medication was injected, and only there, I believe that the byetta is the perfect suspect.  Now, if I could only find a doctor that will listen to me.  The count is 5 and still increasing.  Recently, I lost 4 pounds in 3 days!!!!  This is not normal!	I was to inject the said amount into the abdominal (below the waist, above the pelvic bone) before breakfast and lunch.  The amount was changed when the medical professional I was having treat me decided to increase the dosage, and with terrible results (I was vomiting blood and could not eat or even drink water - I couldn't even stand the smell of food).  I wish I had never heard of Byetta!!!!!!
2254	zovirax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	skin warts on elbow	"I have been plagued with peristent mutiple warts on my elbow for over 10 years. At Christmas - I decided to 'attack' the area again to clear it for the Summer. I used the freezing technique, but warts were clearly trying to spread outside the treated area onto fresh skin areas..  I then added the salicylic acid to the new growths but this just made my arm/skin sore.  I could see the only solution was to control the virus itself to prevent any new spread as the thickened areas died off with the cryotherapy. 
I used a thin smear of Acyclovir around the treated areas and all the new wart 'blistering' stoped iritating within an hour or so and died back.  If I left the cream off - they would start again.  I persisted with the cream daily for 2 weeks and for the first time in 10 years or more my arm is 'wart free' and I have healthy unbroken wart free skin."	"None - In fact it gave great relief to sore irritated skin as new 'wart' blister tried to form. 

I suggest a clinical trial to be used in conjunction with cryotherapy to prevent spread and regrowth - once warts are treated. It is certainly more successful in eliminating 'emerging warts' and preventing regrowth than the recommended salicylic acid - which does more harm then good."	This may be a marketing oportunity for you as re-growth is often more of a problem than treating the original wart.
2818	wellbutrin	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	anxety / depression	I only started this medication to still treat my Anxiety and mild depression, but eliminate the desire not to want sex.	Irritable, sleeplessness, rages of angry, fatigue, high blood pressure	My OBGYN switched me from Prozac to Wellbutrin in efforts to help with the sexual side affects.   Well, it did absolulte nothing to help in that area and instead made me more depressed, irritable, had severe rages, crying all the time, no desire to get out of bed, hot flashes and my blood pressure spiked tremendously.   I went back to my PCP and I'm back to Zoloft which I had taken in the past and although I'm still having w/d's from the Wellbutrin, I'm felling 80% better in it's only been 3 days.   I tossed all the remaining pills out.    This drug clearly didn't work for my body.   What a horrible experience to go through.    I will in the future only get these types of meds from my PCP and not my OBGYN.
2203	advair-diskus	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	asthma	Advair helped with my asthma initially, which was agrivated by an upper resperitory virus.	Heart palpitations and coughing.  These side affects have been decreasing since I discontinued the drug.  Advair seems to be fine for a short time, only to aggravate things later on.	I was treated for asthma which kicked up during the winter cold season, and my doctor put me on advair and prednisone (short dose).  I continued on the Advair for four months and as time went on the side affects became more and more pronounced.  My doctor currently has me off of all steroids and the Advair and is watching me for any complications.  blood tests for thyroid and glucose came back within normal levels.

Took 2 tablets in the morning on an empty stomach, and two tablets at night after a couple hours of dinner. This went on for seven days.
2807	wellbutrin	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression	I didn't feel that there were any benefits. I initially started taking Wellbutrin because it was tauted as having little to no sexual side effects. I really was highly disappointed in the overall experience of this drug. I immediately switched back to Effexor.	After a couple of days of taking the drug, I started experiencing severe flash anger. The smallest nuisance would set me off. I remember actually throwing something across my dining room. It was awful. At that point I decided to no longer take the drug.	I am not certain what I should describe here. The treatment details were that I was prescribed a medication after having asked for it due to its advertised benefits and I never have been so disappointed in a medicine until this one. I am not certain if other people have had similar experiences or not, but it wasn't pleasant.

3102	ortho-tri-cyclen	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birthcontrol	Of all of the birthcontrol pills I've taken this was by far the one with the least number of negative side effects and it actually had several positive side effects.  It helped control my acne and kept me thin.  After several years I did notice a decrease in my libido which came back after I stopped taking birthcontrol pills altogether.  I was put on the generic version of this pill at somepoint and I had a completely different reaction.  I instantly gained about 15 pounds (mostly water weight I think because I looked puffy).  I found out after this reaction that generic pills don't have to be identical to the brand name drugs.  I learned the hard way.	I never got pregnant.	I took the same little pill for 21 days and then the placebo pills for another 7 days of the month.

2026	protonix	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	gerd	Within two days, the severe burning pain of the GERD disappeared. At three months of treatment, the pain from the ulcer has receded considerably. Because of the ulcer, however, I still have to be careful not to eat anything too acidic--very fresh pasta sauce with chunks of tomato--or too spicy.	Shortly after starting treatment, I developed diarrhea. It only lasted for a few days, but then I continue to have somewhat pasty stools, with occasional bouts of diarrhea again.	I went to the ER with severe burning in the chest. The doctors there suspected either cardiac problems or a blood clot in the lungs. Once they made certain there were no blood clots, and that the EKG and cardiac enzyme levels were normal, they started me on IV protonix. The next day I was switched to pill form of the protonix, and the improvement was amazing. Within thirty-six hours the pain was minimal, and by the third day of treatment, it was virtually gone. Since then, I haven't had any recurrence, and remain on the protonix only because of the ulcer, which is improving, even though at a slower pace. Overall, it's an excellent medication, and had worked wonders for me.
3054	seroquel	1	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	mood stabilizer taken w/ prozac	Seroqel seems to calm my mind.  It stopped terrible mood swings and irritability as well.	Weight gain in excess of 25 lbs.	Seroquel was added to my medication regiment after two suicide attempts on Prozac alone.  Once the Seroquel was added, I was able to feel calmer and the mood swings subsided as well.
152	zmax	1	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	strep throat	Antibiotic seemed to work quickly.  My throat felt better within hours of taking the first pill.	Horrible, painful diarrhea after 4 hours of taking each pill I took on day one.	Seems like a powerful antibiotic that works but it's just too powerful for my system and not worth the side effect.
3187	desyrel	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	insomnia, headaches	On the 3rd day, I was extremely elated and more uninhibited than usual; headache was still present, but seemed unimportant. In addition, I slept through the night with the first two 50 mg pills.	My headaches worsened and I had additonal muscles aches. On 50 mg the first few days, I awoke with horrible facial and jaw pain; I also had some congestion. After going down to 25mg, the facial pain ceased, but I began having nightmares and after the day of elation, I was depressed the day following. I am currently wondering whether these effects will subside and the benefits increase.	Doctor started me on one pill for 3 days,then double for the next and 3 pills upt 150 mg. on the 7th day. I am still at 25 mg. due to side effects above.
1622	premarin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hysterectomy	I did not have to go through the change of life so early in my life, never really felt any change, at the time it was the best way to remove all the endrometriosis that i had, and it never effected me much as in pain or my womenhood.	I had no side effects, other than a little soreness after the operation, nothing went wrong, and my sex life actually improved, mainly because there was no more pain down there.	after the operation i relaxed for three weeks no heavy lifting, took premarin, still take premarin, so at the age of 47 still have not had the side effects of menopause, which is nice,  they say there are risk at a later age and how long you've been on them, but am confident enough and quite healthy at this time.
3736	lamictal	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	ptsd	According to my psychiatrist and to what I had read, lamictal could be very helpful for people with PTSD. I had tried dozens of meds over the years and, at the time, was totally crippled with anxiety despite being on all the other meds. listed above. Hours after starting Lamictal I was given relief and the anxiety and dissociative symptoms reduced markedly.	None that I noticed	I was on 25 mg for a week or perhaps two, then raised the dose to 50 mg. I have been on this dose for many years now, along with the rest of the meds I take to manage symptoms.
3823	flovent	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	asthma	having suffered from asthma for most of my adult life, I began to rely on the albuterol (which should be only used as a rescue inhaler) multiple time per day.  After beginning the Flovent inhaler, my asthma was almost non-existent.	It lists that mouth ulcers may occur, but upon following the instructions which say to rinse out the mouth directly after taking the medicine, I have suffered no side effects.	You only need take two puffs in the morning, and another two puffs before going to bed.  That's it!

3661	effexor-xr	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	"Depression was gone for the first time in my life!  I finally knew what it was like to be ""normal""."	I did not experience side effects	"I had taken other anti-depressants with no benefit and negative side effects.  I also had done various talk therapies.  When the dose of Effexor XR got high enough, I felt for the first time what it was like to be ""normal"" - happy, sad, etc. without the overbearing feeling of depression.  When I had to go off the Effexor XR due to cost, the depression recurred.  This drug literally changed my life.  However, when I talk to other people who were not helped by it, they frequently are on a very low dose.  I am glad that I found a doctor willing to prescribe a high enough dose to be beneficial."
2065	warfarin	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	heart condition	"Taking 3 mg of warfarin sufficiently thinned my blood so that I did not find it difficult to do everyday tasks.  I immediately felt better after I started the regimen in the spring of 2003.  My cough went away and I had a lot more energy.
I took this regimen for about 3 years, everyday.  I also found it easier to concentrate and think (what was I doing before it???)  It was as if my brain cleared up or something.  I breathed easier and I was more willing to tackle regular household chores.  I worked over 50 hours/week before and during this treatment."	"The side effects of warfarin on me did not become apparent until a couple of years later.  I started feeling weak and I bruised easily.  I acquired more broken blood vessels/capillaries veins in my feet and calves.  I was tired and started feeling cranky.  I stopped taking warfarin for 6 months but then went back to it after I had the old feeling of ""thick"" blood.  During the 6 months that I wasn't taking warfarin, I felt better, had more energy.  But then the downside: my blood was getting too thick and I was starting to get headaches.  So I went back on it.  This time my doctor said I might have to increase dosage to 4 mg. since I hadn't been taking the warfarin.  However, when I had my thrombin checked, I was okay at 3 mg.; I took this for another 3 months and then started feeling the old way and quit again.  The same scenario was repeated (started feeling like I had ""thick"" blood and now I had increasingly bad headaches).  I went back on 3 mg. of warfarin in August of this year but only took them for 3 months. Then I started a vitamin/mineral/COQ10 regimen and stuck with it and am still doing that.  I credit most of the perfect blood feeling (for lack of a better term) to Vitamin E and the fact that I also changed my diet.  I try to eat a lot of veggies and fruits, and I have been a vegetarian for almost two years (not super strict - but I feel disgusted about eating meat and therefore never eat it unless it is buried in some food.  I do eat salmon and tuna.  The final straw for me with warfarin was that I started feeling really mad about things.  The littlest things would make me angry, anger that was way out of proportion to the incident.   When my teenaged daughter started crying after I ripped into her for staying longer at a social visit, and I heard my words echoing in my house, I knew that was it.  I quit warfarin and started taking 81 mg. of aspirin daily (I had a headache every morning after I went off warfarin).  I started the vit./min. regimen in November, gradually adding supplements as I learned about their benefits, but it wasn't until 3-4 weeks ago that I realized I wasn't having any headaches and I was able to stop taking 81 mg. of aspirin. Also, since starting the stricter diet and the vit./min. supplements (also some herbs), I have not had an anger ""fit"" (of course, I am also more prone to control my anger because I really didn't like how I had been), I do not feel depressed.  I have told everyone in my family about this because it seems so remarkable.  Why didn't the doctors tell me?"	Treatment consisted of simply taking 3 mg. of warfarin daily and getting my blood thrombin checked every two months.  I was not a very good patient about getting my blood thr. checked so I'm sure when I was feeling weak and bruised/bled so easily, my blood was getting too thin.  And then when I would quit the warfarin for several weeks, sometimes months at a time, my blood would get too thick.  I really like my doctor though, because he tells me to do what makes me feel best, and I think that's smart advice.  I must say add that I always loved the feeling of donating blood before I took warfarin because it gave me the same feeling as I initially had with warfarin (at the very beginning of my treatment).  I would like to donate blood now but they don't let me because I don't weigh enough (which makes no sense at all).  Couldn't they take less blood?  Who determined how much blood you can give anyway?

Excellent sleep aid.	Marked drowsiness.  Mild intoxicated/sedated type feeling.	"Provided pain relief but only during times of severe pain or spasm.  Made me very drowsy; if I had to take it during the day I would break the tablet in half and take 5mg instead.  This still provided a significant amount of relief with less drowsiness.  
Worked great as a sleep aid; not only did it knock me out but it also promotes proper sleep stage patterns that SSRI antidepressants disrupt.  Has a noticeable hangover effect in the morning however."

When waking during the night, returning to sleep was not a problem.  The drug did not cause sleep so deep that waking and being coherent was difficult.

992	armour-thyroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	Within about 2 days I noticed I had more energy.  I wasn't waking up tired, I wasn't craving sugar and coffee and my mood improved dramatically.  I stayed on the medication for about 2 years.  Gradually I noticed that I didn't need as much so I cut back on my dose. Eventually I went off for a year or two.  Then when I noticed the old symptoms of mild depression, tiredness, sugar cravings etc., I went back on.  I found that the natural form of Armour allowed my thyroid to kickstart.  After talking to many people who have used the synthetic form, they didn't experience this.  Their thyroid seemed to shut down and they had to always take the drug.	None	I started out at 1/4 grain every other day.  Gradually I increased that to every day.  Then I would take 1/2 grain every other day.  Eventually I found I took about 2 grains per day for a couple of months.  I felt great and as I noticed I didn't need as much I reduced the dosage.

3314	rifadin	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	mrsa abcess	The abcess and inflammation around the area disappeared. It is very important that MRSA abcesses be treated immediately. If you have a history of MRSA, get to your doctor and begin medication as quickly as possible. Rifmapin is a very effective drug for MRSA infections. The doctor will do a workup of all the effective medications against your specific MRSA infection and choose the appropriate antibiotic.	There were no side effects that I encountered. The drug must be taken on an empty stomach, which is not the case for many other antibiotics. If the drug is not taken on an empty stomach, its effects will be diluded and the drug will be less potent against the infection. It is always recommended to follow the instructions for any drug very closely, and as for rifampin, take it on an empty stomach.	Rifampin is a drug used for MRSA infections. It is important that for any abcess that presents, for the doctor to take a culture of the bacteria and send it to the lab. Some abcesses are not MRSA infections, and others may be MRSA infections. MRSA can be very serious in elderly or immunocompromised patients, and will many times present as localized abcesses in the healthy patinet.

Very relaxed."	I had a tummy tuck sx and was prescribed Oxycodone for the first week and it knocked me on my butt!  So my PS switched me to Tramadol.  She told me it would help with the pain, but not as well.  But I think it actually helped more and since I was in a normal state of mind I could actually feel the effects.  Tramadol is great for moderate pain and wont drug you up like Hydrocodne or Oxycodone does.

Fistulas no longer occurred and stayed healed and erythema on legs did not recur once I started taking this.	Despite most of colon and rectal area healing, my sigmoid colon developed a bad stricture which may require surgery to remove.  Was very disappointed that healing did not seem to be complete and now I may have to have surgery.  Only side effects from taking the medication I noticed was a very high susceptibility to colds and other easily spread illness.  Also length and severity of colds much worse than when not on it.

Thankfully I do not need to use albuterol daily, as I know some people do, but I use it as needed when I am experiencing an asthma attach. This happens on average once a month, less in warmer months, more during the winder.

As far as being effective albuterol, and the name brand inhaler is the best, and to my knowledge, still the only small inhaler that really works. I'm sure it has saved lives. With one inhalation I am able to breath again within minutes, this is even if I am having a bad attack, and am really strugling. So it is very effective"	But, when I use albuterol I experience mild chest pains afterward. Not immediately, but typically later that day or the next. They don't last long, just a sharp pain or two, but it does occur fairly often. In my case, since I don't use albuterol regularly, it's well worth it.	Inhalation, pump spray

It was hell when the time came to stop taking it. It's very addictive and I felt nauseous, dizzy and just plain horrible when I first tried to stop taking it. I went back on it and started taking St. John's Wart with it. This helped immensely when it came time to try to quit the drug again. After a few weeks of taking the herb, I slowly started reducing the amount of Paxil I was taking by breaking up the tabs and taking less and less of it each day. I finally got off it and will never, ever take it again. It was a nightmare."
3898	dispermox	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	jaw abscess	"I had an infected jaw, an abcess under a back molar that inflamed the entire left side of my lower jaw producing a large ping pong ball sized swelling. This was probably -- my dentist suggested -- due to an infected tooth root that had migrated to jaw tissue.
After taking the drug, the swelling started to lessen in about 36 hours and progressively lessened over the next 5 days until it was not visible."	I felt a sense of fatigue, low energy and slightly depressed.	Dentitst recommend root canal, and proscribed codeine should have any pain as well as another round of the antibiotic.

General tiredness, I try to work out about 3 times per week.  But I still ran 2 miles about 5 days ago.  I will say that I sleep MUCH better since I started taking DORYX.  I don't wake up during the night at all because it makes me so tired.  I feel more mentally awake during the day, but my body is still tired.	I am looking forward to staying on this medication if this is all the side effects I have.  Please reseach the side effects carefully though before starting on this medication.

I have had fibromyalgia for 13 plus years and was excited about the FDA finally approving Lyrica for fibromyalgia patients.  I would recomend that anyone suffering from fibromyalgia try this medication, along with a healthy diet and exercise. Lyrica is not a cure, but I have improved probably 75% over this last year.	"It took my body 3-4 weeks to get used to Lyrica.  It did make me feel a little different ""high"" would probably be the best way to describe it.

1035	vyvanse	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	add	Lasted all day long, could put it in a drink,	insomnia, and irritability	Compared to other ADD meds I tried, Vyvanse seemed to be the only one that didn't interact with the Prozac. Also, I think finding the right dose had a lot to do with that.  Because I could easily split the pills I was able to take a larger dose in the morning and a lesser mid-morning and not have a big drop at the end of the day.
3873	levoxyl	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	thyroid	calm.  The reason that I went to the doctor was my son at 19 just reached full blown schizophrenia.  I was trying to find out his drastic change in behavior for about 4 years taking him to different doctors.  I drug tested him-none- alcohol-none.  My son was not the son I had raised. Started psychiatry doctors and diagnosed  with chronic paranoid schizophrenia.  Medication was prescribed.	"My son and family were working on the daily struggle with  him and medication.  Everyone was struggling.
I was out of control."	3- 20mg tablets a day.  Taking the prozac helped me get myself back together and get on with my life.  The medication  I have taken for little more than ten years.  My family is strong and we are together making good.  Very slow but all going in the right direction.  My choice of going for help was needed.  The family is working on their own challenges.
585	acyclovir	7	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	shingles	The acyclovir was highly effective even though taken late - ie a week or more after I first got shingles.  It was still spreading 7-10 days later but once I starteed taking this medicine it did clear up.  I was also relieved that I had very little lasting nerve pain afterwards	None except for exhaustino from disrupted sleep pattern due to needing to take the medication every 4-5 hours	as above - I was prescribed this medication for severe shingles, which went from my calf up to my lower back on my left side.  They covered the left lower side of my body extensively.  Treatment occured late due to many doctor's reluctance to treat me whilst i was breastfeeding.  However treatment became essential and I was prescribed them about 7 or maybe more days after first going to the doctor.  This treatment did work with no bad effects on myself or my baby through the breastmilk
1852	augmentin	5	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	cat bite infection	The infection cleared	Loss of appetite, heartburn, nausea,light headed feeling, gas, bloating,did not sleep well, 2 episodes of extreme dizziness  (side-effects were most extreme at mid-point - 5 days.  About 7-10 after completion I developed a vaginal yeast infection, which was cleared with over the counter medication.	The cat bite on my foot was very swollen and painful.  I was hospitalized for 4 days, during which time antibiotics were administered intravenously every 6 hours.  When I was discharged from the hospital I felt fine, without any of the symptoms described above.   When I started taking the Augmentin there were very few side-effects - they became very noticeable after the 5th or 6th day.  By the end of the treatment, the dizziness had subsided as did the light headed feeling, but the intestinal discomfort remained until 3 or 4 days after.
4107	chantix	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	smoking cessation	I was able to quit smoking after 7 days without major withdrawals.	I experienced vivid dreams.	I tried on numerous occasions to stop smoking but was unable to remain smoke free.  I read about Chantix in a magazine and set an appointment with my doctor to see about getting a perscription.  I began my therapy, set a quit date for one week later.  I followed the instructions and noticed at approximately day three, that my cravings had eased somewhat.  In the days that followed, the payoff I usually recieved from the nicotine no longer had the same effect.  This was somewhat annoying to me, however I continued with the medication until I finally quit smoking.  I have been smoke free for over 6 months off the medication.  Chantix is one of the most effective medications I have ever used.  It really worked for me.
934	levaquin	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinus infections	The sinus infections start lightening up within one day, the pressure disappeared within two days If the antibiotics were not prescribed in a timely matter, the infection would have lasted for month. I would have lost all sense of smell and taste for a very long period of time.	The antibiotics created a sense of nausea throughout the day,In addition I have to take my pro biotics in order to prevent the common yeast infections that come with the antibiotics	My sinus infections would be very intense within 1 day, the medication relieved the severe pressure within one day and cleared the infection.

After taking it for one week, I felt like a new person. For me this was a miracle drug. I stopped taking it after a month and was pain free.  
Since then, When ever my Fibromyalgia flares up... I take it for a week or more and it puts me back on a deep sleep pattern. I don't have to take it all the time. Just when I need it."
1639	oxycodone-and-acetaminophen	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	neck and back pain	"IT WORKED FOR RELIEVING SOME OF MY NECK AND BACK PAIN.

1877	doxycycline	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	infected throat and lung	The drug relieved the sore throat and lungs, albeit within two or three days.  I continued to have coughing fits only at night.	The side effects were moderate, however the medication should not be taken prior to going to bed.  I had an irritated esophagus and horrible indigestion for a full day and a half because the medication did not dissolve correctly as I had lied down.	The doctor prescribed doxycycline to me to eradicate my infected throat and lungs.  The treatment was intended for 7 days at 100mg a pill and the instructions were to take 2 pills a day, however, following the side effects, I took one pill a day until.
2417	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hashimoto's hypothyroidism	Hypothyroidism treatment -- restores proper thyroxine levels in body, not produced by my damaged thyroid gland.

My acne cleared up significantly, but I still had the occasional lesion."	"I had almost a continuous yeast infection, despite taking probiotics.

Skin rashes and sexual dificulties	Prominent hair growth front of the mid-scalp area. I got from International Drug Mart, an online pharmacy.

It's used to prevent the onset of asthma symptoms, and I've found it to be extremely effective.  I take it once a day, and it virtually eliminates any asthma symptoms/attacks.  I would recommend it to anyone who suffers from asthma.
2339	propecia	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hair loss	A slowing in androgenic alopecia, and some potential re-growth. The slowing of the male pattern balding creates an environment suitable for topical solutions to have stronger more effective yields.	Erectile disfunction, weight gain.	Taken on a daily basis at the same time everyday. Taking it everyday at the same time increases the potential for the medication to work so that the body gets a consistent dose to work with. Otherwise the body gets confused.

2246	zovirax	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	cold sore, fever blister	This ointment seemed to lessen the severity of the outbreak and duration.	None noted	I applied the ointment several times a day.  The sooner the application after the first symptom (usually tingling) the more effective.  As I stated still had the outbreak but the ointment did lessen the severity and duration.
208	elidel	6	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	eczema	Decreased eczema patches, however did not fully heal them. The treatment did not help my skin being scaly from eczema.	There were no noticeable side effects.	The treatment consisted of 2 times a day of applying the cream into the face for eczema. Pimecrolimus came in cream form so it would rub off easily.
1200	prozac	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Before I began taking this, I had experienced a long time, chronic depression. After about one month of taking this I began feeling much better. Although things still are not perfect, and I have very blue periods, it has at least made life tolerable.	Reduced sex drive.  Had quite a normal sexual appetite before using this, and it has decreased dramatically.	Began taking 20 mg daily then increased it to 40 after 3 months.

My skin seemd to look 10 years younger	I wore 60 SPF everyday even in the winter to avoid any sun damage.  I did not experience any side affects.	I was seen by my doctor and he thought the medication would be the best route to take for my condition.  I was told to put it on my face three time a week at night. However-  I used it every night
3923	nexium	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	gerd	Acid reflux stopped, I am told that the damage done by the effluxed acid will be healed.  But I am not sure if this drug really strengthens the sphincter such that acid reflux is stopped.  Nexium mainly reduces acid production, but does is stop the efflux is yet to be seen based on the results after stopping the treatment.	Halitosis - Bad breath from day - 2	Excellent in treating GERD.
19	proquin-xr	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	urinary tract infrection	No diarrhea and better drug efficacy.	None at all.  The person who previously reviewed had an allergic reaction.  That does NOT mean the drug doesn't work, that means she simply can't tolerate the medication.	"My father is in a wheelchair.  For those of you with handicapped family and friends, you know how difficult urinary tract infections can be.  Ciprofloxin was a major break through for UTI's.  Unfortunately, paralyzed men and women have trouble holding their bowel movements due to the ""dumping"" effect of cipro releasing directly into the gut.  Although not widely promoted just know that Proquin XR has truly changed my father's life.  Instead of being hospitalized once a year due to a UTI, he can now take Proquin XR and continue on with his normal daily life/work etc.  Proquin XR basically allows the body to metabolize more of the medication and this in turn makes the medication more efficacious.  In layman's terms, it works faster and more effectively.  If you have digestive issues due to cipro or any antibiotic, you seriously need to try this medication.  It has not only helped my father but has made my family's life much easier."
4064	amoxil	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	chest infection	cleared up cough and chest infection, although the treatment worked it was difficult at first to decide how much better it was making me as I had hot flushes, dizziness and diarroheah, all in all it took a good 5 days to start working	dizziness, hot flushes and diarroheah	3 x a day for 7 days
54	flexeril	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	restless sleep	Much more relaxed evenings and better sleep.  Was able to sleep through the night.  Woke in mornings without back aches and pains.  Flexeril was effective as a muscle relaxant.	Very sedated feeling the next morning.  Found it very dificult to approach the next day with any vigor.  Additionally there was a feeling of nervousness or anxiety associated with taking this medication.	One dose nightly as needed for sleep.  No other medications or supplements were used.
1870	augmentin	7	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraine in assoc /w upper resp infection	It truly cleared my headache in three days. I felt no reason to finish the meds unless it was necessary. That pretty much sums it up as to say I would recommend it to others in need. I thank the drug and pharmecutical industry much indeed. Again, Thank you.	None	The treatment took away the migraine headaches. It opened up my head and cleared the mucus that clogged me with sinusitis. I was then able to breathe much better.
2308	lexapro	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression & anxiety	Immediate benefits were realized, faster than my doctor anticipated. Also, I wouldn't always take Lexapro consistently, and when symptoms returned, by resuming Lexapro, I experienced results in 2-3 days.	In the beginning, I felt a little dazed and disoriented for the first 1-2 weeks of taking Lexapro. Once my body adjusted to the drug, I felt like it took the edge off irritability and made me feel like my old self. Sustaining side effects were sexual; a decrease in ability to orgasim.	10 mg of Lexapro was prescribed to be taken 1x daily. I was advised that this drug builds up in the system over time and that results generally wouldn't be measurable until taken consistently for a minimum of 4-6 weeks.
1094	effexor	9	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	"I've taken various anti-depressants through the years, but this was the closest I ever came to a ""cure"". 
Granted, it was after I stopped taking the medication that this ""cure"" took place, but I never experienced this with other anti-depressants. While taking it, Effexor made me so sleepy all the time that I slept a good deal more than normal (10-12 hours daily). This is why I stopped taking it. But when I did, I felt better than I had in years. I remained depression-free for about 3 years. I then dealt with depression again for about 8-10 months (I didn't want to lose another 6-8 weeks taking the Effexor ""cure"" so I delayed, hoping I would just ""snap out of it"" on my own). When I finally conceded this wasn't going to happen, I returned to my doctor, who then convinced me to try something new, so I tried Cymbalta, hoping to get Effexor's benefits, without the side-effects. It worked well as long as I used it, but when I stopped, there was no ""cure"" like I'd had with Effexor. Now I take 600-1000 mg of samE. It's not as good as the post-Effexor experience, but I feel less dependant on the medical system for my maintenance, and I focus on physical health (good food, exercise, vitamins)to maintain my emotional health. Those things alone, unfortunately, do not completely do it for me, and that's where the samE comes in. It makes the difference."	As indicated in the question relating to treatment benefits; the side effects of Effexor, for me, were a tendency to sleep a lot, and to feel sleepy much of the time.	"I began Effexor under the care of a psychiatrist who was treating me for depression. My depression took the form of a lack of interest in all aspects of my life and I had begun to ""shut down"" to such a degree that sometimes the act of just walking from the garage into my house required a strong act of will. When I had to run errands, like grocery shopping, I felt an uncomfortable detachment from my environment. My treatment with Effexor, at worst, sometimes simply took me down (energy-wise) an additional notch from where I was. At best, it shifted me from the uncomfortable detached feeling and elevated my mood a couple of notches above where it had been. I had moments of feeling fully functional. That was enough to give me a sense of feeling better, and the will to decide to take my full energy back. That's when I stopped taking it, and experienced the miraculous ""cure"". If I ever experience such a deep depression again, I will choose to try the Effexor again (the original, not the newer version), rather than the Cymbalta. With the Cymbalta, I would already know that the benefits would only last as long as I chose to be on it, whereas, the Effexor would give me hope for a lengthy remission."
3012	cipro	1	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	urinary tract infection	urinary tract infection subsided	"horrible...began feeling nauseous after 3rd day...disoriented, general ""sick"" and weak feeling...terrible digestive pains and upset...lasted more than a year afterward...felt like digestive tract was ulcerated or raw, very explosive bowel movements, tendons in heels would ""catch"" and stiffen...an odd side effect but found out online later that it is one of the known odd side effects of Cipro...fluroquinone poisioning i guess as that is what Cipro is.  Will NEVER take it again!"	took prescription as directed but by day three could not continue
3159	prednisone	3	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	severe recurrent sinus infections	I was given a short course of prednisone to take, along with whatever antibiotic I was currently on, whenever the antibiotic alone was not clearing up the sinus infection.  The prednisone worked like a charm, but at a cost.	Sleeplessness!  Taking the prednisone was like drinking ten cups of coffee every night or like being on speed.  I had unnatural amounts of energy -- nervous energy -- and wore myself out during the time I was taking the prednisone.  It always helped to clear up the infection, but then I had to recover from the prednisone.  This is a scary drug.	In addition to whatever antibiotic I was currently on, I was to take 9 mg. of prednisone -- the first few times, it was 3 mg with each meal, but that was really too much, so later we did the three tabs all at once in the morning -- a day for several days, sometimes as few as 7, sometimes as many as 15.  Then, I had to taper off the amount I took for several days, in 3 mg increments for a few days each new dose.  Finally, I would be off it.  This time.
3363	lipitor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high cholestrol	i was told that i have high cholestrol and was very concerned about it so my doctor prescribed Lipitor. I had taken other drugs to lower my cholestrol, but they did not work as well as Lipitor, after taking the lipitor for 3 months my numbers dropped from 311 to 174. that was my goal and it worked... yay	there were no side effects for me	take one pill daily to lower my cholestrol
2326	lexapro	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	I had hit the wall dealing with work, cllients,and family. My general physician asked me to see a therapist to help get me going in the right direction. After one meeting it was recommended by both caregivers that I take something to help me get through this rough spot. After about 3 weeks I started feeling like things were easier to cope with and I was making good decisions and getting things done again.	The only side effect I believe is some weight gain, approximately 10 pounds!!!!!	I take 1 lexapro daily. I have finished up with the therapist. I am feeling great.
1548	methotrexate	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis	Treatment benefits from taking methotrexate included significantly reduced inflammation in the joints which led to reduced pain.  Overall fatigue was also minimized.	The day after the injection I was extremely worn out.  Almost like having the flu.  I took the shot on Friday nights, went to bed around 11pm, and then wasn't able to get up before noon the next day, simply due to severe fatigue.  After Saturday, I typically felt pretty good, though.	Once weekly injections with methotrexate.  Also took prescription-strength folic acid to minimize any side effects.
3452	tamiflu	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	swine flu like illness in a pandemic	Reduction of symptoms ( extreme tiredness, mild fever and muscle aches, dry cough ) within 24 hours. Resolution of symptoms within 48 hours.	None.	"The drug was started within 24 hours of first symptoms. Following the advice on the packet the tablets were always taken with food ( single serve cheese and crackers ) and some gatorade. I was careful to maintain hydration with Gatorade brand drink. First dose was late afternoon so set alarm clock to wake at 3 am for next dose rather than waiting till i woke up naturally which given my tired state may well have missed a dose then pushed each dose back by 2-3 hours until they were being taken at times more agreable to the bodyclock.

Unfortunately cough returned after skipping a dose on the 4th day of the standard 5 day course. Resolved after 2 doses again so got another packet and continued for 2 days more until symptom free for 24 hours."
2891	inspra	2	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	conn's syndrome	"Prior to the Inspra I was on Spiractin, which I am back on now.  I took the inspra to reduce possibiity of gynecomastia, which was presenting in the form of breast pain.
My blood pressure normalised on both Spriractin and Inspra."	Severe anxiety attacks commenced approximately two months after starting, and in hind site was a slow build up, but got to the point that it interfered with normal day to day	"Spiractin originally prescribed for treatment of Conn's Syndrome, however some brease pain was experienced shortly after commencing the medication.  Further consultation with treating doctor and Inspra was prescribed as alternative.

Inspra commenced and side effects described above experienced so reverted to Spiractin after short time.  Side effects ceased almost immediately, 48 to 72 hours after cessation of Inspra completed."
754	flonase	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	chronic sinusitis	The medication is much cheaper than the other prescription medications like it and works very well.	None that I have noticed, but if I skip a day or two I experience mild congestion.	I had chronic sinus infections due to inflammation and allergies. This medication has worked pretty good and is an alternatice to sinus surgery. If your doctor prescribes a more expensive form of this drug(Nasacort AQ), ask them to let you try Flonase first. It worked for me.
2995	sulfasalazine	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	psoriatic arthritis	Significantly reduced pain and swelling in lower back, hips, knees with in two weeks. Virtally no pain after one month. I have completey stopped all anti inflamitory drugs. Much increased range of motion and can now sit/stand for much longer periods of time with no pain.	Slight yellowing of fluids and in whites of eyes.	.
1132	evista	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	osteopenia	I didn't take the medicine long enough to get any benefits	I started having side effects within days of taking it but didn't realize it thinking that I was dealing with other health issues.  I started out having a very bad sore throat, hoarse voice and cough.  Went to a RediClini and got on antibiotic.  Also went to see a Dr. 2 days later and was given a prednisone pack because I had chest congestion and by that time I had laryngitis plus shortness of breath.  I dealt with these symptoms for 2 weeks.  Cough and wheezing got better and then I realized the connection between getting all of these symptoms and the side effects.  Checked online and sure enough, all of them were listed so I called the Dr. and stopped the medicine.  Shortness of breath is better and my voice is getting somewhat better.	None.
2143	concerta	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	add - mild depression	The 2 first day we're fantastic. I was easy going, task didn't birding me and I would overall say that my focus was good. However my well being was so great that I was mostly in my mind with great Joy.	"NOW day 3 up to now - I feel mostly the side effects, such as nausea, physical numbness and irritated and NO effect of increase on attention.
I'm paying attention as to know if I should continue or try something else or live without it as I always did. Very unpleasant !!! Women seem to do great on Aderall"	"Unpleasant !
By the way is it normal to pay to see the psychiatrist around 150 $ for monthly renewal and says he does not take insurance. How do other people handle this.
I invite you to answer me at fionahopes to hotmail"
2183	carac	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	actinic keratoses	erradication of actinic keratoses. Patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma	the entire face was treated.  The chin, nasolabial folds and crows feet areas were most sensitive and became red, inflamed & scaley. On the rest of the face only hte keratoses reacted to the treatment	the entire face was treated 1 per day
3266	zoloft	4	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	While I definitely did notice some improvement in my depression, I believe that Zoloft is far from being a truly effective antidepressant drug. My depression had somewhat subsided and my panic attacks were less severe, albeit not completely gone.	From my personal experience, this drug exerts its effects mainly through a total numbing of one`s emotions. I had become a zombie, not feeling depressed but at the same time not feeling any positive emotions. My emotions had been totally flattened. My libido was gone. I had absolutely no desire for any kind of sexual activity.	"50 mg per day, in the mornings. Total duration of the treatment: 3 years.
During the treatment course, attempts were made to titrate the dosage to 100 mg per day, but I couldn`t tolerate it."
3090	minocycline	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	acne	I originally took the medication in a smaller dose for 3-4 months and saw a reduction of pus-filled pimples. The physician increased the dose to hopefully increase the benefits, as I still had significant acne.	After taking this medication for 1 week, I experienced sudden severe joint pain and stiffness, almost like very bad arthritis. I was 30 years old at the time.	I took this medication as prescribed by a dermatologist for 1 week at the 100 mg dose before severe side effects started. Side effects disappeared by 3 days after discontinuation.
2049	prempro	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hot flashes, depression	Within two weeks I found the hot flashes had subsided.  After 4 weeks I no longer had night sweats.  It took 3 or 4 months for my depression to get better.  The release from depression was tremendous and such a relief.	I could not notice any side effects.  I did not even gain weight.	I take these religiously every day.  The prescription was written by my primary care provider (a female) and even thought much younger than me, she understood immediately my primary concern was the depression; even though the hot flashes and night sweats were uncomfortable.
3949	prilosec	3	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	acid reflux	Reduction of acid.	Side effects from 20mg per day after one year of use were those listed in over-dose of prilosec side effects; along with other side effects not listed. Anxiety, heart racing, saliva depletion (resulting in excessive cavities), facial bumps (going away after two weeks off), constant extreme thirst, aggitation, saliva gland malfunction/swelling, lack of hair growth.	Very difficult to get off of this drug.  Took apple cidar vinegar.
1579	xanax	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	difficulty sleeping	All three medication, Alprazolam, Lipitor and Metformin were effective in treating insomnia, high cholesterol and insulin resistance.  Patient is evaluated every 3 months.	Limited, some muscle pain when taking the Lipitor every day, and maybe increased forgetfulness with the Xanax.	N/A this is being written by a patient, not a physician.

It also reduced some puffiness in my face - perhaps b/c I had inflammation in my jaw joint.

2888	avita	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	wrinkles	There were no treatment benefits--See below--I hoped to begin to see some effects after several months but because I had so much difficulty with it I gave up.	My skin became so irritated and red that I stopped using it.  I was using just a small amount and still had trouble with irritation and small, watery itchy bumps appearing, primarily around my nose and mouth.  The prescription strength was probably too high and because it was purchased in Mexico it also may not have been from a trustworthy source.	I had used Differin in the past with good results but was considerably younger then--in this last round I tried it hoping to reduce wrinkles but couldn't proceed with using it due to irritation etc.

3246	nuvaring	3	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control	It was nice to not have to worry about a pill every day, you can put one ring in and then don't have to worry about it for 3 weeks.	I noticed that I felt really down around month two of taking in, my mood swings were severe, I felt tired ALL THE TIME. I could also feel the ring during sex and it frequently came out during sex.	ALthough it is convenient, it almost defeats the purpose of birth control if you have to worry all the time that the ring is going to come out. also, mood swings and feelings of tiredness were almost unbearable. would not recommend it.

The routine was also easy to maintain, as it only required nightly application.	My breakout were more frequent and severe when I first began this treatment.

The side effects are that your face becomes very red - like a bad sunburn.	You put the cream (Carac) on the bad cells whereever they may be, once a day for three weeks.

815	ambien	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	insomnia	The drug does get the patient to sleep very soon after taking the drug.	The side effects are not worth it.  While it gets you to sleep, it makes you incredibly groggy the next day.  I had problems concentrating.  Also, I started sleepwalking with no memory of my actions.  This can be very dangerous.  Also, after taking it for a few days, it would become difficult to stop taking it.  I would rather not get as much sleep rather than take this medication.  I only take it a few times a year now mostly to reset my clock if I've traveled, but would never take it on a regular basis.	The treatment does not require very much other than taking the prescribed drug as needed.  However, if you take it a few nights in a row, it it difficult to stop.  But you should stop because it makes you very groggy and gives you headaches during the day.  It is good for a sleepness night when back from traveling so that you can get back on a regular sleep schedule.  It should not be taken on a regular basis.

2125	renova	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	wrinkles	I used the product to try to reduce previous sun damage as well as discoloration and wrinkles created by aging (I'm currently 50).  I feel the product did even out my skin tone at least somewhat however did not remove the larger areas of discoloration due to sun damage.  Overall the condition of my skin did improve, however the effects were not as dramatic as hoped.  This may be due to the discontinuation of the 0.05% formulation which would of course be more potent that the 0.02% that I could get.  I will try Retin A next time around to go for the 0.05% and see if results improve further.	Treatment side effects were overall very minimal.  I had been told to expect a considerable amount or redness and perhaps flakiness.  This never occurred whatsoever and virtually no affects from application itself were noted.  The two items that were noted is that I was initially not aware you could not receive waxing while using Renova and had a burn resulting from an eyebrow wax.  I also did find, as stated, that I would burn much more easily in the sun.	My skin care program prior to Renova was wash with Cetaphil, tone with a Paula Begoun antioxidant toner, 8% glycolic acid gel, moisturizer.  Same in the evening.  After adding Renova, same routine in morning but in evening I went to:  Wash with Cetaplil, tone with same product as before, wait 30 minutes, apply Renova.  On alternate nights, I add a Skin Recovery Antioxidant about 30 minutes after the Renova.
2292	lexapro	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	panic attacks	I have no more panic attacks, it helped to reduce anxiety, to improve the mood. I feel the old myself again and can function well at work.Sometimes I still experience anxiety attacks but they are not severe. I highly recommend this drug due to minimum of side effects in comparison with other antidepressant drugs.	None, the only disadvantage was it started working after 2 weeks of usage.	The treatment is supposed to last 1-1.5 years
2329	lexapro	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	Before taking Lexapro, I had constant anxiety.  I wasn't haveing panic attacks on a regular basis, but I was having them one in awhile.  My anxiety presented itself more in constant worrying, waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall asleep, and feeling tired but restless all the time.  I was moody and impatient, and obsessed about little, insignificant things all of the time.  Once I started taking Lexapro, that all changed.  It did all go away completely, but i can manage the slight symptoms I experience now.  I am much happier, much more stable, but more successful in my life.  I know others on it (my husband), and they have experienced the same kind of success.	I have never experienced any side effects.  I take it every morning and it's like taking an asprin...you don't notice any type of change.  If I miss my dose a few days in a row, I notice my behavior changes and I get moody and worry-some, but it takes a few days to experience that.	I have taken 10 mg a day, every day, for the last 3 years.  It took a few weeks for the medicine to take effect (about 2) and the chance was gradual, but one day i woke up and noticed that I felt normal.  It has been wonderful for me and I am very thankful I have access to it.
2507	delestrogen	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	menopause/hysterectomy	"Significantly reduced symptoms of menopause, including eliminated all hot flashes (as long as the drug is being taken), reduces skin dryness that occurred after hysterectomy, and preserved sex drive. 
preserve sex drive"	I am not aware of any side effects from this drug, I did not experience any.	Doctor told me I could take as little as 1/4 tablet per day if I wanted. I take one per day and I am very happy with the results. If I accidentally skip one day, I know fairly soon that I have missed it because I get chills or start to have hot flashes.
563	atenolol	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	mitral  valve prolapse	"My heart rate was rapid (usually 110-130 bpm) and I frequently had feelings in my heart that left my short of breath for a few minutes.  My heart rate slowed down to normal (usually 70-85 bpm) and I very seldom have these episodes anymore.  I feel much better overall and I do not have that feeling of ""impending doom"".  Also my blood pressure is good and I do not have to take an extra medication for this problem."	The only noticeable side effect for me is the drop in blood pressure, which for me has been beneficial. I have been told this medication can make you somewhat sleepy or lethargic, but I have not experienced this.	I take Atenolol once a day in the morning and that's all the treatment that I need to keep the mitral valve in my heart function correctly.
2562	inderal	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	severe performance anxiety	Miracle drug for anyone who's deathly afraid of giving speeches or oral presentations. Eliminates the whole butterflies-in-the-stomach feeling, racing heart, sweaty palms and allows you to focus on what your doing and do it properly rather than worry about how nervous you are.	None.	"The doc first suggested that I take paxil every day for 3 wks before a speech and then get off it. I had to push her to prescribe me Inderal instead because I had researched all the drugs extensively and new what I was looking for. Never rely entirely on the judgement of doctors, always verify their advice and do your own research.  It can save you time, money and alot of side effects.  

I take 3 small tablets and hour before a major speech or presentation (about once a year).  I am thinking about using it for situational anxiety as another user suggested, I had never thought about it as I try to stay as far from drugs as possible and I only use them in extreme situations, but I have missed many networking opportunities because of my anxiety and I think that this drug would have helped.  I have not experienced any side-effects.  I don't think the drug has significantly risky long-term effects.  I think the long-term negative effects of situational anxiety are far worse then the potential risks of inderal."
205	elidel	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	skin rash	Easy to use, no scent, absorbed quickly, rash cleared up	None	Contact dermatitis due to detergent allergy on hands.  Wouldn't go away with over the counter medications.  Used Elidel twice daily for approx one week.  Used gloves on hands at night to increase effectiveness of the product.  No side effects, no odor.  non greasy.  Cleared up the condition nicely.
1693	retin-a-micro	3	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	acne	None that I had experienced.	Redness the first week.  Then acne got worse.	Decided to stop treatment after three months.  I was using it to get rid of small pimples on my forehead.  After using the product, I noticed I was getting bigger, and bigger pimples. So I stopped.
3395	clobex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hand dermatitis	This is the only treatment, besides cortizone shots, that had any effect.  My outbreaks consisted of opened , cracked sores (up to 9 at a time)on my fingers that were extremely painful. With a shot of cortizone every couple of years, Clobex takes care of the rest.  When I do not have an outbreak( and outbreaks are very mild if I treat them right away, I only use it a couple of times a week for prevention. I should mention that I need to be very careful and use gloves for many household cleaning tasks.	Nothing bad.	Put a very small amount on my hands, smooth over all of my fingers.  Use twice a day during an active outbreak.  Use a couple of times a week thereafter, as prevention.  I also use lots of moisturizer and wear gloves for cleaning tasks, etc.
1527	fluvoxamine	5	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety/worry	None, especially surprising since the prescription name brand Luvox had been used previously, with great results.  The Luvox stopped all ruminations and obsessive worry, while the generic fluvoxamine seemed to do nothing, and did not help with sleep.	Some vague nausea, which was not a problem with the name brand drug.	"At the time of weaning my second child, I was apparently experiencing some hot flashes/night sweats and worry/ panic and tried fluvoxamine, the generic version of Luvox (which I had used previously by about four years).  I had successfully used Luvox and was able to discontinue it without any side effects or symptoms of worry returning.  This time only the generic was available to me so I tried it - thinking that it would be the same drug and provide similar results.  It did not.  I experienced nausea, and did not get any sleep benefits, although I felt that the Luvox had improved my sleep when taken at night; neither version of the drug caused any drowsiness.  I did not feel any improvement in symptoms with the generic version.  Perhaps my hormones needed to balance on their own, and were too intense for the fluvoxamine to modify.  I hope there will be something better available if menopause eventually causes a return of symptoms.  
Some generics are better than others, and individual reactions differ.  It is useful to have this rating information available to access online."
2878	avita	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	improvement of skin appearance, very very mild acn	"Overall skin improvement: Skin feels softer, more radiant. Better complexion. Younger looking (my perception).

Skin turned slightly less oily. Number of blackheads reduced and became almost invisible."	Very mild (non-lasting) skin irritation occassionally in combination with other cosmetics (cleanser). Very minor skin flakes occurred a few times (easily removed). Skin tone became slightly more pink (I actually see this as a positive thing).	"Nightly application of a dot of tretinoin cream all over my face (except for eyelids and lips) after cleansing.

At daytime skin was always protected with at least SPF 30."
2408	synthroid	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypothyroidism	Synthyroid replaces thyroid hormones that provide energy and increase your metabolism. I had a small goiter that was diminished when I began taking the medicine. If I miss a few days I have very little energy and feel as if I'm carrying heavy suitcases around.	My skin has white spots on it due to lack of pigment. I have read that Synthroid causes skin pigment loss and wrinkles. I f the dose is too high then i feel nervous and jittery.	I take 100mcg every morning. It is suppose to be taken on an empty stomach but I simply take it before breakfast. My thyroid hormone levels have to be checked annually to make sure the dosage is effective.
662	suboxone	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	opiate/heroin addiction	Was able to successfully, and completely, discontinue illicit use of heroin/opiates.  I did remain abstinent for a period of time w/o it, but no longer than 6-7 months.  Always at or before that point I would wind up relapsing again, with no good outcomes.  Have stayed opiate-free for 1 year, 9 months now, and continue suboxone treatment.	"Only negative(/side) effects noted are:
Don't take doses too close together - feel dehydrated, headaches, fatigued.
DO NOT neglect meeting w/prescribing physician for writing of next script. Ive had to miss 2+ appts before, and have gone b/t 1-6 days w/o medication.  I HIGHLY SUGGEST TO AVOID THAT."	"I initially started at 4mg (/half 8mg tablet) 1x in am.  Gradually rose to 1 8mg tablet 1x in am, and then 2 8mg tablets 1x in am.  I found that, as said above, if i took doses too close together (ex: Noon on Sunday, then 4am Monday), would feel odd, off, and very drained.  So now i take 1 8mg tab in am, and 1 8mg tab in pm.  Found to be very effective and feel very 'steady' and 'even' throughout the day, and night.  No issues with taking am/pm's too close together, or far apart.
Also go to group & individual counseling, and see psychotherapist (as well as intermittent AA/NA meetings) to stay active in Recovery and stay healthy and well, all around.  Also do the aforementioned to stay on top of depression and anxiety as well as reg life issues."
3957	prilosec	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	disappearance of very severe symptoms of acid reflux and excessive stomach acid production which included ulceration on the esophagus and stomach lining.	I am allergic to a great variety of prescription and over the counter drugs. When the patent for Prilosec expired my doctor prescribed Nexium which in a matter of  hours sent me to the emergency room with pancake size hives and disabling swelling of the joints. I went back to Prilosec (over the counter now) and  have been taking this medication faithfully for the past 17 or so years with no side effects or allergic reactions.	40 mg. once a day and more recently (for the past 5 or 6 years) 40 mg. every two days.
2304	lexapro	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"maintain mood, decrease in depression, the combination of meds provided for a drcrease in hospitializations and lethality. More activity on a daily basis and a return to ""normal"" behaviot in re : to sleep patterns and appetite."	decrease in sexual desire, decrease in sexual preformance and responsiveness	one and a half tablts once a day of lexapro combined with100mg topamax and 300mg trlileptal for bipolar disorder and major depression and ptsd.
2519	motrin	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	ankylosing spondalytis	Reduced intensity of morning stiffness, reduced length of morning stiffness, reduced pain, increase in range of movement	some mild stomach discomfort particularly if taken without food or milk	"Depending on my arthritis pain, I would take 1 x 600mg Ibuprofen two to three times per day. During flare-ups, it was necessary to ""hit the pain hard"" and take 600 mg four times per day and on the very rare occasion 5 times per day (this has not been necessary for over 10 yrs.)"
89	pristiq	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	No side effects, other anti-depresson pills usually made me stop taking them because of the side effects, but Prestiq had none. I actually felt better after taking my pill, I was more bubbly and felt like my old self. I was also less aggravated and could think more clearly.	I did not have any bad side effects. The only bad thing I can say about Prestiq is it is expensive about $50 a month even with insurance. There is no generic as of yet.	I would take one pill before bed time each day. I have noticed as with other anti-depressants I would have to take them at bed-time or they would keep me awake. I didn't notice any problems with prestiq when taken in the morning.
647	seasonique	4	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	preventing pregnancy	preventing pregnancy	This pill was great b/c i didn't have any periods and also prevented pregnancy, but that doesn't help you don't have ANY sex drive. I didn't have any sex drive at all... not decreased. none at all. horrible. switching back to Ortho-Tricyclene lo. I'd been on that since 2002.	n/a
764	flonase	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	I suffered with terrible allergies, itchy eyes, runny nose, sneezing and cough.  Using Flonase stopped all allergy symptoms within just a few days.	When you spray it in your nostrils your mouth will have a horrid taste, but does not last long.	Once a day nasal spray, spray once in each nostril. It is very easy to use and works vey well.
1056	oracea	4	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	rosacea	Did not notice much difference in decrease of rosacea bumps or redness but the bumps seemed to increase briefly after I got off the Oracea. For approximately one week after discontinuing use. I used in conjunction with topical Finacea, which I applied twice a day, also prescribed for rosacea.	None noticed though per the treatment details (see below) it was often difficult to take based on your eating schedule.	Take one pill a day. Must take one hour befor eating or two hours after with plenty of water. Also need to avoid sunlight while on this product though that is a good recommendation for skincare regardless of medication.
2238	allegra	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergies	When my allergies were acting up and I took it, it helped within an hour. It cleared up my nose and throat and made breathing easier.	Drowsiness and I had trouble sleeping. Also the drowsiness carried over to the next morning so I felt run down all day.	When symptoms were bothering me I took it and it helped relitivily quickly.
827	zegerid	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	I just filled all this out to get to read the info pack on skin care, but I accidentally logged out of it somehow and don't know how to get back in other than doing this all over again so that is what I'm doing - and I'm pissed.	None that I know of as far as I can tell.	Once a day and that's it. Now do I get to get back into my reading
1241	sotret	8	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	acne	It reduced my acne considerably and, after ceasing the treatment, I have never had acne as severe as before.	"Red, extremely dry and flaky skin
Depression"	The dermatologist tried several other options before going to Roaccutane. I tried using antibiotics, Retin A (which, knowing better now, I didn't use quite correctly), and Diferin gel. In the end, Roaccutane was the only thing that really mad a difference. I do, however, notice that my skin does look older than that of my peers. I don't know whether it is as a result of the Roaccutane, or whether it's just genetic.
1904	doxycycline	8	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	acne	My acne did heal. I took it consistently for about 2 months and my acne healed up and my skin looked really good after a long time, but when I forgot to refill it, I started breaking out again. So after taking it again for a couple of weeks my skin started to clear up. I have not taken Doxycline for a few months now and my skin is doing good, besides the occasional break out.	The side affects were almost unbearable but I was determined to get clear skin so went through with it. There are many rules to taking it, such as on an empty stomach, no lying down after taking it, 2 hours before or after antacids, iron or vitamins/minerals. You must take it on an empty stomach so the it absorbs more efficiently and works effectively, But it is painful. I would feel extremely nauseous with a really bad stomach ache. Sometimes when I was in the sun my skin was more sensitive.	I had really bad almost like nodular acne . I visited with my dermatologist who gave me the option of taking Accutane or Doxycycline and i decided to to go with Doxycycline since Accutane had a considerable amount of side affects.
3598	fluconazole	2	Ineffective	No Side Effects	yeast infection	pill added nothing to the treatment process	no known side effects from the pill	I was prescribed fluconazole (pill taken orally) and clotrimazole (cream applied topically) for the treatment of candida.  I was first told to take the pill, and then use the cream in 3 days if the pill did not work to reduce the yeast infection.  I took the pill for 3 days alone, without the cream, and saw no improvement.  I took the pill plus the cream for 4 more days, and it slowly started to clear up.  I was told that one pill, taken once, and not repeatedly each day, should have cleared it up.
1531	skelaxin	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	neck and hip pain	None	None	I saw the primary care physician for neck and hip pain, she prescribed skelaxin and physical therapy.  The physical therapy was the treament that worked, along with simple ibuprofen.  Skelaxin did not help with muscle relaxation, and I did not refill the prescription--at over $100 for a 30 day supply!
3257	noroxin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	urinary tract infection	elimination of all symptoms related to the urinary tract infection including frequency of urination, pain upon urination, and urgency of urination	none were experienced	Took one tablet in the morning and one in the evening.  As it had to be taken on an empty stomach I took the tablet about 1 hour before breakfast, and one hour before dinner. Instructions were to avoid dairy products 6 hours before and 2 hours after taking this medication, but I found this to be too restrictive, and so I did not adhere to this recommendation.
3287	zoloft	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	clinical depression	stopped circular thinking/anxiety.  Also allowed me to keep focused on tasks and what was going on around me.  eliminated suicidal thoughts and allowed me to be more positive.

The first month was the hardest, not knowing what to expect or how people would treat me.

After I joined HerpresFish.com, I learned to except my situation and not let it burden my life. To those who are new to this it gets better after time less stress equals less outbreaks. I want to commend HerpesFish.com for giving people like us a platform to share or stories with people living with the same conditions."
789	ambien	4	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	sleep	The drug was very effective in helping me to fall asleep, and to get a good night's sleep.	After taking the drug for more than 2 nights in a row, I had a very difficult time sleeping without the medication on subsequent nights	Because of difficult nights without the drug after a few nights on the drug, I have sought out other sleep aid medications.
2062	prempro	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	menopause	reduce menopause related issues and improve quality of life.  Hot flashes ceased, energy level increased, overall mood and memory retention were impacted in a positive way.	mild bloating, breast tenderness which did subside.  Basically I did not have any major side effects and the mild ones decreased with usage.	Prescription is to take one tablet by mouth once a day, preferably at the same time of day.  Continue use until either want to no longer take or at advice of doctor.  Continually discuss with physician.
3310	zoloft	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	I found the treatment was very helpful exspecially around my menstral cycle. I use to feel like I could crawl out of my skin two weeks before my period after starting zoloft I notice a considerable difference.I also felt anxious and restless which has subsided with the use of the zoloft.	I did not seem to be subjected to any side effect. I was concerned about weight gain, fatigue and uncontrolled hunger but I did not have any of these side effects.	First you must be diagnosed with either anxiety or mild to moderate depression. You begin at a lower does to see how you manage with that then eventually if need be your perscriber can increase the dose. Their is no special time of the day to take it and you do not have to eat with it. The most important thing is it does not alter how you feel through out the day you do not get a sensation of being high or druged. There is no lasting effect, if you stop the drug it is out of your system the next day.
1875	doxycycline	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	rosacea	"I didn't know I was suppose to keep taking, so after one month, stop the medication & that's when the rosacea got worse & the eye involvement started.  I had to go to an eye doctor & get eye drops.  My dermatologist started me back on the doxycycline & said I had to take it ""forever""."	If if take the 100 mg, I get an upset stomach, so I called the doctor & asked him to replace the medication with two 50mg tablets each day, which I've been taking for a week & it works much better.	I need to take the medication twice a day, but one hour before eating or two hours after, which has turned out to be a really big nuisance, since I like to eat six small meals a day.
2169	zyrtec	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	environmental allergies	less sneezing, less nasal congestion, less eye irritation, improved energy, improved sleep at night.	none, none, none.	Tried a variety of other medications without success. I am still on Zyrtec, even though I pay a lot more for it. I also use Nasonex, which helps, but not to the same scale as Zyrtec.

Cover with plastic type saran wrap and tape so that cream does not get wiped off or smeared.  wash off thoroughly in the morning.
3039	seroquel	7	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar mania	"I am using this on an as needed basis. I only take it a couple times a month, which is why 50mg still works for me.  I may have to go to 100mg though. If I have been up for 20-25 hours straight and if I am still ""bouncing off the walls"" (manic), then this is great stuff to have.
For as needed manic episodes and severe insomnia--this is great stuff."	Biggest problem is the LONG half-half.  After sleeping for over 10 hours, I spend the next 6 hours after I wake up foggy-headed and VERY lethargic. After this I usually feel good again.	I mainly suffer from severe depression and anxiety but after a couple weeks of this I sometimes suffer from 2 or 3 days of mania.
171	zomig	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraine	I would sell my soul to the devil to obtain this miracle pill.  In a little as 30 minutes the intense pain and nausea are gone after one zomig.  I have had migraines since in my early teens where I was unable to function for as long as 48 hrs.  I have lost jobs, missed family outings and missed many opportunties due to migraine,  Zomig changed all of that and allowed me to take the medication and go to work and all the outings that I had missed.  I had a young family when I discovered Zomig and it was like a miracle was handed to me.	Thankfully there are none.  I am able to function completely both at home and work.  There are 2 ways I take the drug.  If I feel the headache start and I am at work I take a pill and usually I get relief within 15 minutes.  The only drawback is that I may have to take another pill within 12 hours. On the other hand if I am able to take the pill and lay down for 20 minutes then usually I can get up and resume all of my activities.  This is truly my wonder drug that has allowed me to fully participate in life.  I do not know where I would be without it.	None
412	imitrex	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migrain	As soon as I felt a migraine coming on, I would feel very tired and feel dizzy at first and then the headache would come a little later. As soon as I could feel the headache I would take one tablet and within half an hour to an hour the headache would go and I would feel a lot better but still a little odd, a not quite 'here' feeling	I don't think I have any side effects as such but I usually feel a little odd and very tired after a migraine but not sure if that is the after effects of the migraine or a side effect of taking Imigran. Before I was given these by my doctor my migrains lasted for 3 days with severe headache and nausea.	My doctor told me to take one as you feel a migraine coming on, if it does not work it is not worth taking another one but this rarely happens. If the headache goes but comes back I can take another one, I tend to do this if the attack is servere, I might need to take two or even three over two or three days but generally I find one tablets works. I have been taking it for approx 10 years or so.
2553	dexedrine	2	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	add	"weight loss right away.  I felt it working in brain right away, but lost the efficacy when I built my tolerance.  My MD gave me more and the same thing happened.

Meds don't cure add 100%, so now I take supplements."	"insomnia, I got obsessive complusive and had to stop.  I also think I have a bit
of liver damage of taking meds over 10 years.  I only took dexedrine for a few months."	"rec'd speed but no focus. I took the dexerine in morning and it wears off at
night.  I lost weight for the first time as the metabolism was great, sadly
i gained 15 lbs off the same diet."
416	imitrex	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine headaches	This drug has changed my life.  I have had severe headaches most of my adult life- Imitrex takes the headaches away.  The only downside is that the drug causes me to be a bit drousy.	See above	I take the drug at the onset of a headache.  Within 10 minutes, the headache symptoms disappear
2606	adderall-xr	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	attention deficit disorder (inattentive type)	He was able to go to college and while he still wasn't the greatest student, he managed to get all assignments in on time. He rarely skipped classes. This was not at all true when he was in high school (prior to starting the medication.)	None.	"He was initially started on Concerta but he felt that the effects ""kicked in"" as he was leaving school and was having trouble sleeping (even though it was more than 12 hours later.)
He started on Adderall XR 30 just once daily and he was slightly more attentive but adding the second dose was more helpful. Interestingly, he states he does not particularly enjoy being more attentive and does not take it when he does not have school."
1302	zocor	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high cholesterol	On Zocor my total cholesterol was lowered below 200 and my LDL was lowered below 100. I currently take Zocor 40mg and could probably reduce the amount I take to 20mg if I would dedicate myself to a serious diet and exercise program. I am a nurse and work nights so this is difficult. Zocor has kept my cholesterol down and reduced my risk for cardiovascular problems.	I have had no side effects.	I started out on Zocor 20mg and with diet and exercise was able to keep my cholesterol levels low. However, I started working as a night shift nurse and not eating as well and had to increase my dose to 40mg. This dose has kept my cholesterol levels under control even with lack of regular exercise and not the best diet.
2952	zyban	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	smoking cessation	The treatment seemed to help considerably with the generalized brain 'fuzziness', lack of focus, fatigue and irrational mood swings that I had experienced on every other non-Zyban supported attempt to quit smoking. The treatment dramatically lessened the effect of nicotine withdrawal, or at least its perception, such that any reflexive craving to smoke was manageably overcome until the habit was finally broken.	"At 150mg/d side effects were minimal - perhaps a slight boost in energy. In contrast, at 300mg/d - which I could handle for only a short period - I felt ""shaky"" with restless legs and some insomnia. These problems went away when I reverted to 150mg/d. I feel the treatment was entirely effective at this lower dose, and unmanageably unpleasant at the higher [and recommended!] dose. Perhaps Zyban should revisit their dosing recommendations."	I began taking 150mg/d two weeks/ 14 days before my actual quit date. On the quit date, I also started a series of yoga classes and regular physical activity through the first few months of smoking cessation. I decided to continue taking Zyban beyond the recommended period to a full 3 months at 1 dose daily. In my experience, I would recommend a lower daily dosage of 150mg/d for a longer extended period of time given my success in using Zyban in this manner.
3725	lamictal	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar	I was hospitalized in January for suicidal thoughts/attempts. At the time, I had been diagnosed with clinical depression and prescriped antidepressants only. They would induce mania and I was totally out of control, so much so that I pretty much lost all of my friends and went through a divorce. At the hospital, I was diagnosed as bipolar and since taking Lamotrogine with Effexor, I've had no thoughts of suicide or cutting, which I used to do often.	Some dizziness and vertigo.	Started out with 50 MGs and went up to 200 MGs slowly. I haven't had any severe side effects, just the same I had with antidepressants.
364	neurontin	2	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	chronic pelvic pain	Essentially there were no identifiable treatment benefits.	The main side effects were fatigue and dizziness, which became worse with increasing dose.	This medication was intended to reduce patient use of narcotics by providing adjunctive treatment of chronic pelvic pain, as indicated by several studies. I have also prescribed it for neuropathic patient. Most patients experience no benefit, or if there is any benefit, it occurs at small doses. Titrating the dose up seems to worsen side effects without providing any added benefit. In addition, it is a costly drug.
2411	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	underactive thyroid	The treatment benefits were to counteract underactive thyroid conditions. Specifically, it kept my metabolism from being too slow, which meant that it diminished face swelling, kept my skin and hair from becoming dry, and from me feeling unusually cold and tired.	I did not experience any side effects from this medication.	I am taking .125 of Synthroid once a day, every day. I take it in the morning, before I eat any food.
2949	zyban	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	smoking cessation	assisted with stopping smoking	vivid dreams, dry mouth	2 tablets each day - for 2 weeks continue smoking and then stop after 2 weeks. I don't know how this works but I really did not like smoking when taking this. The treatment still requires a fairly high degree of willpower to manage the cravings. I keep a checklist of things to do - brush my teeth, drink water, go for a walk. I have now been smoke free for 6 months and at times it's still hard - I do still get cravings but they don't last very long and I can control them. Another good tip I got was to put some butts in a jar with some water. A quick sniff of this and the thought of smoking goes away.
744	flonase	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinus allergy	Relief for my nasal clogging and breaht normally. Works great!	I've experienced no side effects, although there was some mild headache during the first day of use- this could have been due to other reasons.	Moved to a new area with a lot of trees / greenry and experiecing temporary allergies while there. got prescribed flonase with dosage described above, and felt much better.
73	flexeril	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	inflamed neck muscles	This muscle relaxer allowed me to sleep at night and wake up without a stiff neck. I was not in pain any longer at night.	It made me groggy in the morning. After a few days this side effect seemed to go away.	I had tweaked my neck muscles and was in a lot of pain. This helped me relax so the inflamed muscles could heal. To my surprise, it actually worked. I would definitely use it again.
3302	zoloft	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	I immediately felt my mood swings and irritability disappear and I became a nicer person again overnight. My partner noticed it immediately and I noitced it in myself. I havn't cried at all and  although I don't feel depressed it's more that all my feelings have been numbed! I feel that nothing affects me and that I am better able to cope day to day.	The main effects have been the chronic fatigue. Although I sleep fantastically each night I wake exhausted and spend the rest of the day feeling like I have a hang over. I have no energy all day and find that I don't want to do anything all day although I do wonder whether that is through no energy or motivation! Feeling so fatigued also makes you so low and depressed so thats no help in the long run.Also my libido completely disappeared especially in the early days although it is not fantastic now.	Although this has been by far the best treatment drug I have tried in terms of treating my depression and mood swings and irritability at the moment I have chosen to withdraw from the drug due to the chronic fatigue which was bringing me down and beginning to make me low in another way. I have been told by the professionals that I have a chemical inbalance and that I have to take the anti-depressants like a diabetic has to take their insulin but for the moment I have chosen to have a moment drug free to find out what sort of person I am! I suspect I will last only a few weeks. Of of all the drugs I have tried this has been by far been the most successful for me in treating the symptoms.
3368	lipitor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high cholestral	I started taking 30 MG's of Lipitor for one year; the next year I reduced to 20 MG's and have done so well, I am now (and for the past 3 yrs.) on 10 MGs per day. I have no side effects at all from this drug; and have blood workup done yearly.	No side effects	Treatment details were listed above
1272	provigil	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	daytime drowsiness	Good cognitive enhancer.  I like that the effects come on very subtly and they also go away in the same manner.  I don't like to feel like I need a prescription which has no other (yet) proven benefits in long term cognition, I hope to either find another supplement to do something similar or see some research which shows Provigil has many more benefits than it does drawbacks.	Sometimes the sensation of racing pulse.	200mg once a day.
2221	allegra	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	poison ivy	made the condition tolerable so that I could work.  I am highly allergic to poison ivy and it lingers usually for three weeks.  On these drugs I was down to under two weeks and could still work.  Totally controlled the weeping.	No side effects	Take the Prednisone on a sliding scale for two weeks, starting with five tablets a day and ending with one a day.  Taking the generic Allegra twice a day initially, say for the first day or two, and then just once a day.
2373	propecia	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hair loss	Male patern baulding was reversed significantly.	None noticeable.	I started taking Propecia 4 years ago. Initially I took it daily as prescribed. Over about 12 or 13 months I noticed a significant reversal in my male pattern bauldness. Thereafter I slowly reduced the doseage and now only take 1 tablet once per week. My hair has not receded as a result.
2000	vicodin	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	molar extraction	I felt no pain from the extraction on the Vicodin.	While taking Vicoden, I was very dizzy and sleepy. I was unable to drive or function at a normal level.	I was given a prescription for the first week with an option to refill. I did not refill because I was not in a lot of pain and didn't want to continue to experience the side effects.
3761	spironolactone	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hormonal acne	decrease in acne, and less oil in skin and hair	slight lack of energy, decreased sex drive, irregular menstrual cycle, - I experienced four periods in a span of a month and a half - slight dehydration, and more severe mood swings than usual	I took 25mg twice daily for three months. It was definitely effective in treating my acne, although I still received breakouts - just not NEAR as many. It didn't take very long to kick in, but by the middle of the second month I started to notice my lack of sexual desire. Did that disappointment me? Yes. During the last month and a half I was having issues with my menstrual cycle. I had four periods during that time. My usual cycle is typically somewhere between 35 and 45 days. So this worried me a little. By the end of the third month I was experiencing mood swings. Caused by my irregular menstrual cycle? Possibly. I don't know for sure. I would wake up mad, have a wonderful day, and then come home and cry myself to sleep. And why would I be so upset? No freaking clue, but I do know that it was entirely exhausting. If it weren't for such side effects, I would have rated this drug higher because it did exactly what I wanted and cleared my skin up.
2439	wellbutrin-sr	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	The benefits of treatment were a lifting of depression, specifically as it relates to Wellbutrin, to elevate the ceiling of emotions. It also had a midly energizing effect.	Very occassionally a racing feeling if I took the two doses too close together.	I've used wellbutrin in combination with other anti-depressants, but it is usually the other one (Zoloft, Prozac, Effexor) that loses it's effect after time. Wellbutrin has remained consistently reliable and contributes to the livlier aspects of mood elevation for me.
2639	polymyxin-b	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	conjunctivitis	It relieved symptoms of conjuctivitis including iching, dryness, soreness, buildup of mucus and sensitivity to light.  Symptoms seem to clear up quickly and render the patient non infectious after 24 hours of treatment.  It can be given to pregnant women with no adverse effects to the unborn child	There did not seem to be any side effects to the use of the drug	The drug is a liquid administered in an eye drop form.  It is self delivered into the eye.  2 drops are given in the affected eye up to 3 to 4 times daily for a total of 7 to 10 days.
1503	metrogel	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	rosecea on the face	The treatment benefits were that the skin on my face eventually returned to almost normal.  No more white scaly skin cells, no more red patches and lumps, which i think was inflammation, no more slight soreness, whilst using the cream.	None	I applied the gel to my face-underneath the eyes and on both sides of my nose twice a day for two months initially. There was a great improvement though it didn�t get rid of the condition completely.  I found the sun agravated the condition and the rednes and scaly skin would return and then I would use the cream for about a month until the rosacea disappeared.
2215	benicar-hct	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressue --  diuretic	My blood pressure levels were controlled quite well.  However,  they spike from time to time,  not dropping until I take another dose.	There were no side effects that I am aware of.	"The medication was prescribed to control symptoms of high blood pressure and water
retention that I was experiencing.  

I was also advised to adhere to a low-sodium diet and to exercise moderately.  This and taking the medication faithfully has served well to decrease  high blood 
pressure symptoms.  However,  water retention has not significantly reduced."
1223	prozac	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	In general, I have enjoyed daily happy moods and more energy. I am able to focus on tasks better and can accomplish more each day. Mood swings, irritability, and temper outbursts are rare. I have gone from below-average to above-average coping skills. Feelings of worthlessness and suicidal thoughts no longer occur.	Increased thirst and decreased libido.	Before Prozac, for many years I was unable to experience sustained happiness or control my mood. I was irritable at least 10 days each month, had uncontrollable racing thoughts, experienced frequent temper outbursts, felt hopeless and worthless, did not view life as worthwhile, thought about suicide often and made several attempts. There was no joy in my life and I suffered from delibitating migraine headaches 5 or 6 times per year. When I went to the doctor, I was unable to stop thinking about suicide. My doctor put me on Prozac, 20 mg each a.m. and I improved dramatically in a few weeks. After 6 months, I felt like I was slipping back a little, so the doctor increased my dose to 40 mg each morning. As long as I take the Prozac, I am happy and stable and have maybe one migraine a year. About once a year I try to reduce the Prozac to 20 mg, but within 1 week symptoms begin to recur so I resume 40 mg daily.
3153	prednisone	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	pneumonia with associated cough	The drug really did help the inflammation of the lungs and cut down on the cough.	Stomach upset,hunger, which lead to overeating, severe acne breakout of the face.	I had a pretty bad case of pneumonia, which had culminated in a horrible hacking and convulsive cough that I could not get to go away. I was given Ceftin (I believe, can't remember the dose).  I was also prescribed an inhaler and the prednisone. I had never taken a steroid of any kind before.  The first couple of days were okay, though I noticed I felt constantly hungry or my stomach hurt slightly, it was actually hard to tell which it was. So, I was eating a lot of crackers and thinks that I thought would help.  After the five days my skin began to break out all along the jaw line and forehead, which was not usually a problem for me. The breakout was so bad, I went to see a dermatologist who put me on a month of tetracycline, which cleared up the skin.  Overall, the prednisone made me feel lousy!  I hope I never ever need it for anything again.
2111	renova	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	facial skin	My skin looked much better and my pores became much smaller. Many people remarked that I had a much smoother look. Also kept wrinkles from forming.	Scaly patches on the sides of my face that would come and go.

3891	dispermox	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	sinus infection	IT was to be for a sinus infection which was not able to be documented due to the immediate reaction to the drug.

2010	vicodin	4	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	surgery recovery	Relieved pain, helped me fall asleep	I had severe constipation and nausea, along with some onfusion, dizziness, and cramping.	I stopped taking Vicodin and switched to over the counter tylenol as a remedy because the side effects were so severe and negative.  I was constantly, severely nauseated after taking Vicodin.  My body did not tolerate this drug well at all.

I dint take the drug for next two days then i took 0.5 mg (1/2th of  1mg pill)on 3rd day and it proved to be the most horrible day of my life. It caused  extreme tiredness and mild pain in body as if i have got mild fever. I was totally exhausted and confused about what was happening. I felt the sensation in my blood vessels as if my blood pressure had risen and difficulty in breathing. I  was not able to think clearly and had no option than resting on my bed. i waited whole day to pass this nightmare.  In night i tried to  meditate to keep my mind peaceful. meditation helped me a bit but i found my rate was not normal . I went to sleep thinking every thing will be alright next day. in bed, I started feeling mild pain in my testicles. i surrendered my self to situation and waited for next morning meanwhile i got a sleep. Next morning i felt better as pain had disappeaed, tiredness was not there but still felt difficult to concentrate. But i could think clearly, I  carried the remaining pills of propecia with me on my waY to office and threw them in dustbin on road.

3229	nuvaring	1	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	birth control	I didn't get pregnant, because at the time, I didn't want to have another baby.

Also a reduction in bloating of the stomack and cramps. i was also able to eat a more varied diet without the awful symptoms of burning and indigestion which normally accompany the acid reflux.	i have to say that i didn't really have any major side effects from this drug, ceratinly none that would out weigh the positives.i did experience constipation on a regular basis but i increased my fibre and fruit and vegatable intake to counteract this problem.i also did experience and increase in headaches, but they were very mild.	"Losec tablets contain a medicine called omeprazole.This belongs to a group of medicines called ""proton pump inhibitors"" They work by reducing the amount of acid that your stomach produces.

1415	adipex-p	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	weight	Used for weight management and food intake control.  It is also supposed to give energy.  It definitely worked for cutting my appetite as long as I took it twice a day.  If I took it once a day at about 8 am I would feel hungry at about 5pm.  If I took it twice a day 8 am 10am I could make it to bedtime without being hungry.	Side effects were random for me most of the times.  I would definitely NOT feel the energy that it was supposed to give me.  Sometimes when I would take it it would have the opposite affect on me and actually make me crash.  On some days it would make me feel foggy and other days I'd feel crisp and clear.  I also broke out with pimples on it.  You have to remind yourself to eat.  Some days I'd also have trouble falling a sleep.	"I would take 1 30mg pill in the morning at about 8am and then another 30mg pill at about 10am (sometimes trouble falling asleep if taken later).  I have done that for 2 months.  At the beginning I started off with only 1 pill a day.

1466	cymbalta	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	The benefits are less depression and better mood. It took about two weeks until I started to feel better but now I feel I may need something a bit stronger as I feel I am too used to taking this medication. I plan to ask for a higher dosage or different medication.	Really none.	I don't really know what the details would be except that I started with 20mg and was increased to 30mg within two weeks.

2591	proloprim	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Dermatologist suggested trial of trimethoprim 2x per daily, once morning and once in the evening. Diminished acne resulted within the first month and more significantly for the following months. After 1 year, patient reduced to taking pill once per day.	Side effects were mild, but a similar derivative had significant side effects so this patient recommends trying another sulfur-based drug if this once poses problems. Side effects with trimethoprim included very mild sun sensitivity-simply use a sunscreen; occasional yeast infections once or twice per year; upset stomach if taken without food.	Patient suffered acne for over 15 years and had been treated with various oral and topical medications. Oral medications included most typical antibiotics and Accutane. Results were less than ideal. D
1862	augmentin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	earache/sinusitis	After the first day on this drug, my ear pain was gone.  Sinuses cleared soon thereafter.	While taking augmentin, I had trouble sleeping.  When I did finally fall asleep, I had very vivid, strange dreams.  Also noticed mild vaginal discharge.  Some dizziness, but nothing major.	I feel that this med did the job of clearing my sinus infection and ear pain.  Side effects were bearable.  I would take it again.
3491	serzone	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	Lessened depression	It made me groggy during the day & made me sleep the sleep of the dead at night (not such a bad side effect).  I also had dry mouth & it sometimes caused mild nausea on an empty stomach.	I took this med after trying others for depression.  It worked pretty well.

I almost never take prednisone anymore and only take celebrex one time a day instead of two.
2242	accolate	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	capsuar contracture of breast implant	The benefits were not good, and this drug was very expensive and was not effective at all for the problem I was experiencing.  At the time when I was experiencing complications from the implants, I truly believed that my Doctor did not prescribed the drug in time.  The literature I read on this drug claims that it is more likely to work if used early in the treatment of Capsular Contracture.	I tolerated the medication very well.  I didn't experience any illness or side effects from Accolate.  I felt a strong mental negativity towards the drug when it was prescribed based on the literature I read and my Doctor's statement about being treated early.  I think I tried the treatment knowing in my mind that it was not going to work.	I was required to take Accolate for three months to promote softening of my Breast Implants. The 20mg tablets were to be taken twice daily along with continued daily massage of my breasts.  My Doctor said that the treatment had more chances of being effective if used early in detecting the Capsular Contracture (My treatment was started 5 months after the breast implant surgery).  If the treatment didn't work, he advised, I would need surgery.
178	cardura	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	problems with my prostate	Reduced prostate pain.	None that I am aware of.	I took this medication to reduce pain I was experiencing with my prostate.  It took about two to three weeks after which the pain was significantly reduced.

Weight gain (25 lbs.), difficulty concentrating, cravings for carbohydrates, lack of interest in sex.	Withdrawing from the drug was done slowly, with a gradual reduction over a six week period.

3331	tetracycline	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	The tetracycline helped to reduce acne lesions.	Tetracycline was heavy on the stomach and if you ask me added to yellowing of my teeth but that is a subjective view. Mostly it caused stomach gas and disturbance. I had constant vaginal yeast infections because (I believe) of the imbalance of good bacteria.	The treatment was, at that time, one of the treatments for acne. Being a systemic treatment, it did decrease the acne lesions but only on continued use. As soon as it was discontinued, the acne returned as usual. It was to use 2x per day indefinitely and so was not the best idea but at the time did prevent the gross acne lesions that would have occured without.
2259	lexapro	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	Lexapro seemed to work well for me.  I suffered from panic attacks in the past and the Lexapro definitely helped with these.  The Lexapro also assisted with symptoms of depression.	did not have any treatment side effects	My doctor started me on a very low dose to treat some situational depression and panic attacks.  The 10mg did not work well enough and eventually I was given 15 and then 20.  The 20mg seemed to do the trick without any additional side effects.

My boyfriend couldn't get his member inside of me, and when he finally did it gave him severe gouges on his shaft.  It caused me to stop eating, and when I did I just threw it up... It caused me to become violent, I even struck my boyfriend a few times during an argument.  I was on my period the entire week, the bleeding just wouldn't stop.  It was horrible.  Not to mention, the pain I felt inside of my vagina was tremendous.  I could hardly sit down by the end of the week.  I do not recommend that anyone believes this.

Crestor and low dose aspirin were prescribed as an ""aggressive form"" of treatment. The cardiologist was very pleased with the results after only a month's trial. I would recommend Crestor to anyone contemplating statin treatment."
273	progesterone	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	severe stomach pains, dizziness	I have had stomach troubles my entire life. When I was pregnant they were unbearable.  I could never take the pill because of nausea. I noticed that when I was 45 the nausea was associated with my cycle, becoming most intense just prior to my period.  My gastroenterologist prescribed Nexium, which I took for a year, maximum dosage, daily and then tapered off. Then the other symptoms above emerged. When I started with the progesterone all these symptoms subsided significantly and I rarely ever have stomach problems now.	None at all that I am aware of.	Prior to taking the oral treatment I used the cream, to avoid the digestive tract altogether.  This was fine for about a year, but then the symptoms reappeared.  My physician felt that something was interfering with the absorption of the hormones and so prescribed the oral pill and the symptoms have nearly disappeared and I have had no associated stomach problems.   I am convinced that much of my stomach problems throughout my life were associated with a hormonal imbalance, but cannot prove this.  I do know that this is the best my stomach has ever been in my entire life, for whatever reason.
3419	tazorac	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	facial acne	Always prescribed together with topical antibiotics such as Klaron.  Quite effective in curing acne, but takes months and situation gets worse in the first week to month.	Tazorac can peel the skin severely when used together with other medication.  Still moderate peel when applied once every night.	I'm an Asian female in my 30s and have been having moderate acne problem for over 20 years.  Amoung over-the-counter medication, only benzal peroxide works for me, but I still have break-outs from time to time.  My primary care doctor prescribed Tazorac and Klaron for me about 2 years ago and it was very effective in clearing up the acnes in a few months.  But even the prescription cannot fully cure the problem and doesn't prevent future break-outs.
763	flonase	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	runny nose/ allergies	The runny nose would stop about 30 minutes after I used flonase, but would return again within hours after taking the medication. It definitely cleared my sinuses, but sometimes left my nose feeling dry. Probably better as a sinus clearer than at alleviating all allergy symptoms.	There were no treatment side effects.	Treatment only involved twice a day use, squirting the liquid up each nostril. Not inconvenient at all.
2231	allegra	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	Allegra minimized the allergy symptoms without the side effect of drowsiness that is typical of over-the-counter allergy medications such as Benadryll.  After taking the drug, congestion is greatly reduced and the constant sneezing stops.  However, Allegra is not very effective for itchy, dry eyes, which continues to be a problem during peak allergy season.	No side effects have been observed during the 10 years of use.  Drowsiness has not been an issue and no reactions to other medications have been experienced.	One tablet is taken per day whenever allergy symptoms are moderate to severe.  No medication is taken on days when allergies are mild.
1608	coreg	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	heart	lower blood presure,ability to exercise for a longer period of time with out chet pain, same activity while on coreg results in an average reduced heart rate of 20 beats per min.when off the drug exersise tolerance was greatly diminished resulting in angina	none	taken .25 in the am. then .25 in the evening
1365	biaxin	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sinus infection	Cleared up the sinus infection quickly, felt effects almost immediately (less pressure, less pain, less pus being expelled)	Horrible upset stomach and extremely bitter taste in the mouth.	Took Biaxin twice per day (1,000mg total daily) and used Nasocort inhaler for inflammation of the sinuses.
3614	retin-a	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	it cleared up my skin not just from acne, but also from hyperpigmentation	driness of the skin	applying nightly around the face
1609	dapsone	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	dermatitis herpetiformis	Dapsone treated the intensly itchy skin condition quickly and efficiently.  A gluten free diet alone did not relieve this condition.	The side effects after one year have been a slight decrease in red blood count.  There has also been an onset of shakyness which I believe has been a side effect.	2-100mg tablets are taken at bedtime.  The dosage is self medicating, which means that if the condition is under control I can lower the doseage to see if the contrlo can be maintained at a lower dose.  So far, after one year, I have been unable to do so.
997	armour-thyroid	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	thyroid goiter	Before Armour I was taking synthroid, and had huge weight gain, depression, mood swings, etc. After switching to Armour my brain cleared, I had less problem with at least keeping my weight on the same level, no muscle cramps anymore	Still difficult to shed weight	Taking medicine daily, half morning, half evening
2105	renova	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	aging skin, few break-outs, hyperpigmentation	My skin is clear and people have complimented me on the appearance of my complexion.  My rosacea is under control, my hyperpigmentation is fading	No side effects except that I notice my skin is a bit tighter/drier, but this could be because it's winter  and I need a much better day/night  moisturizer.	I alternate glycolic acid 20% cream, tretinoin .05% cream, or Noritate cream under day or night moisturizer (ie a different treatment applied morning and night; the next day starts with treatment not used previously)
2528	lamisil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	athletes foot	Completely cleared up the condition. Without using messy creams, or powders.  Prevented it from spreading to other body parts.	I experienced no side effects.  Although I had too take some blood tests in order to make sure it wasn't damaging my liver.  It can cause liver damage.	Took one pill orally per day for a period of 40 days.
2808	wellbutrin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"The drug worked on reducing/eliminating my situational feelings of depression.  Initially, it increased my energy and focus, and stopped the feelings of sadness.  It did not make me feel like a ""zombie"" and I felt connected to my emotions and the people around me, which I had heard was a side effect of other anti-depressants."	At first I had crazy dreams, whch wasn't so bad.  I did not have any trouble falling asleep.  I had very high energy for the first 2 weeks, then it tapered off back to normal.  I wish the energy had remained.  I did not lose any weight, which I was hoping for...but I did not gain any either, so that was positive.	I started on 150 mg for 2 weeks on the brand name drug once a day.  It seemed like as soon as I was switched to the generic 300mg, the energy and focus benefits stopped.  There is no way to know if it was the switch to generic or just my body getting used to the drug, but it was dissapointing.  I really enjoyed the energy.  I weaned myself off after 1 year because I didn't need it anymore.  I did not have any significant withdrawal symptoms.  Overall it was a positive experience, although I was glad to not need it anymore.
3227	nuvaring	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne and birth control	I switched from Diane 35, a birth control pills recommended specifically for acne and was very worried that the nuva ring would cause an acne flair up, as switching from Diane to Yasmine had. Fortunately my skin stayed just as clear and as a plus no more taking pills nightly	slight vaginal irritation at the end of a cycle, nothing even moderately serious though.	Nuva Ring is a brand name birth control method which releases hormones through the vaginal walls. You insert a flexible plastic ring once a month for three weeks and it acts as birth control.
1854	augmentin	6	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	klebsiella pneumonia infection	Cleared up pneumonia infection.	For me, mild diahrrea.  For my partner, extreme stomach pain after taking the medication with insufficient food and water.  The pain lasted about 6 hours.  He wasn't irreparably doubled over in pain, but he was incapacitated. He was able to take his next and subsequent pills without problem.	On medication for 2 weeks, 3X a day.  Infection cleared up about 2 days after I finished.
3070	oxycodone	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	chronic pain from degenerative lumbar disc disease	eliminated my pain which allowed me to function at an almost normal level. i was mostly bedridden prior to treatment	moderate constipation	was on combo oxycontin/oxycodone therapy for aprox 6 months before switching to just oxycodone. the oxycontin left me feeling groggy and unable to concentrate. it also left me with pain peaks and valleys. by switching to oxycodone only, i was able to keep my blood levels at a more constant rate and my pain was controlled consistently. with oxycontin my doseage kept increasing. with oxycodone my doseage was stable and eventually was able to decrease my doseage from 60mg every 6 hours to 30mg

319	ativan	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	sleep disorder/anxiety	well, the main treatment benefit was that it did help me go to sleep faster, even better than the melatonin that I was taking before i went to bed. Another benefit of taking this prescription drug was that it helped me with my anxiety. I have considerably much less anxiety than I did before taking this.	there were no side effects.	1-2, 1 milligram pills per day as needed.
184	adderall	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Increased productivity, ability to stay awake during the day.	Dry lips & mouth.  Teeth grinding.  Tough time sleeping.  Highly addictive.	This was used in conjunction with Lexapro for depression.  I started taking it to keep myself awake (drowsiness as a side effect of the LExapro).  However I quickly lost about 10 lbs and couldn't stop moving around.  Eventually my thinking became jumbled (I don't have ADD).  I was constantly thinking in circles.

3501	maxalt	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraine	"got relived from migraine , nausea, head aches

Works in 30 mins
It is oral tablet available in both 5mg and 10mg dosages"	I did not have any side effects. But people taking this medication should not take few medications which will increase the side effects of Maxalt. You can find those drugs at http://www.internationaldrugmart.com/maxalt.html	I took once a week
3021	cipro	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	prostate procedure	none	A completely fit and healthy male who exercised 6 days/week who decided to have a prostate procedure to alleviate inflammation.  Placed on Cipro pre and post.  No signs of infection in autopsy.  Upon arrival to hospital 2 weeks post procedure, had extremely elevated enzymes(muscle and cardiac) and died within 3 hours.  Result of biopsy : cardiac arrest due to multi organ failure.	Treated with Cipro for prophalaxis prostate.
2040	cozaar	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	I must have tried 15 different blood pressure meds over the last 7 years.  None of them worked.  I was on Benicar, but the insurance no longer covered it.  So my Dr. switched me to Losartan.  WOW, what a difference.  I now have perfectly normal blood pressure.	None	See above.
843	ritalin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	adult add	allowed me to focus on the tasks at hand, run a business and get things accomplished	tolerance builds up to point where drug looses effectiveness.  higher doses needed to function, but dr declines to increase dosage	before ritalin, artificial stimulants were required to be effective, withour stimulants I was unable to motivate myself to do the things that needed to be done & was very ineffective.  Cocaine got me through grad school & my thesis, but ritalin allows me to function with out illegal stimulants -- problem is finding a doctor who will write rx for the dosage that is most effective (i.e. 20 mg 5x / day).  I am interested in a study that monitors efficacy / tolerance in patients who need / take high dosage on a long term basis.
3523	lunesta	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia	I have trouble sleeping -- I usually toss and turn all night, sleep a couple of hours and wake up.  Normally, I never get a complete night's rest.  After my doctor prescribed Lunesta, it was the first time in a very long time, that I was able to sleep from the time I laid my head on the pillow until my alarm sounded in the morning.	"I had no side effects from using Lunesta.  I felt refreshed in the morning without that groggy feeling or ""hang over"" like feeling."	The treatment involved taking one pill in the evening right before bed.  Lunesta works relatively fast, so you do not want to take it unless you are going right to bed because you become drowsy within 10 minutes.
541	trazodone	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	problem staying asleep	"I am able to fall alseep within the 30 minutes of taking the drug. The drug helps with anxiety so I worry less while waiting to fall asleep.  I usually wake
up only once to use the bathroom compared to 2-3 times when I didn't have the drug. I wake up refreshed and it Cheap too."	The drug is not physically addicting but can be habit forming for pychological reasons.	Take one Tablet by Mouth at bedtime.
1160	zofran	5	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	nausea	no nausea, less vomiting.  able to get through work and school feeling better	mild dizziness, sometimes I would get a headache	I was prescribes 4 mg zofran to take 4 times per day for relief of nausea and vomiting which was most likely due to vertigo.  I had a decrease in the nausea symptoms after the first dose, and had total relief after about 3 doses.  i did experience a mile headache, which I believe is common for this drug
805	ambien	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	insomnia	you must take the drug at the same time to establish a new sleep pattern.  The doctor never informed me of this and I would take it at different times.	Take the drug to fall asleep.  However it should not be taken for more than several weeks due to possible dependency.
2258	lexapro	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression and anxiety	It took the edge off of my stress and anxiety level and helped me feel more present and even-keeled.  I started taking it during a difficult period and it helped lighten my mood.  I did not feel like I was numbed or that I was unable to feel highs and lows.	I gained a few pounds.  It may have had a slight effect on my sex drive, but that is hard to tell.	I started on 10 mg/day for a few weeks and then went to 20/mg a day.  This seemed to be a more effective dose for me.
3744	lamictal	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar ii	Generally effective in stabilizing mood fluctuations and controlling obsessive thought patterns, mild anti-depressive effect	Noticeable word-recall and memory recall problems, insomnia when taken at night, mild flattening of mood/interest at higher doses	Starting with 25mg/day, I titrated up to 200mg a day in 2 months, taking 100mg in the morning and 100mg at noon to help lessen memory effects. During times of great stress, would take up to 300mg/day. Stayed on 200mg/day for a year, then lessened to 100mg/day for another year to reduce side-effects, particularly memory and mood flattening effects. Eventually stopped treatment in order to pursue non-drug therapies, but would go back on the treatment if stress or life events triggered strong mood episodes.
1141	aromasin	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	breast cancer	Aromasin's treatment benefits are unknown.  I have not had a reoccurance of breast cancer while on the drug, though unsure we can attribute that with the drug treatment itself.  Perhaps there are other positive health-related items coming into play, such as exerciase and eating habits.  Not aware of any side effects or adverse reactions.  Drug is very expensive, however.	As mentioned above, I have not had any side effects from Aromasin other than hot flashes and night sweats.  These may be due to menopause rather than the treatment itself. The hot flashes have been relatively mild and can be controlled, for the most part, by limiting or removing all alcoholic beverages.	After breast cancer treatment of chemo. and radiation I was put on Tamoxifen for several years, about 5 years.  After Tamoxifen, it was recommended that I start taking Aromasin, which I have done for about 3 years.  My doctor said it is not known how long women should be on Aromasin and still receeve a benefit from taking the drug.
210	elidel	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	eczema	"Resolve my itchiness and redness at both joints of my arms and the ""circular"" itchness spots went away couple days after application"	Didn't feel it	Per my dermatologist dignosis, I had dry-weather induced eczema, so he prescribed me with this cream to treat the condition. I have no other complications or co-committing disease, so only a small box of aquerous cream is given for moisturing purpose.
3065	oxycodone	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pain	Reduced pain, helped with sleep	Mild nausea, dizziness, fuzzy thinking. Very weird feeling	Medication to be taken as needed for pain after arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Would not want to take this medication unless in severe pain due mainly to the fuzzy headed/dizzy effect.  Certainly could not drive or operate machinery while on the medication.
2525	diflucan	3	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	yeast infection	Eliminate yeast infection	The yeast infection occurred after taking oral antibiotics.  After I took the first dose of Diflucan, I developed an itchy, raised, red, rough rash on both sides of my face and the yeast infection only moderately improved.  I took a second dose a week later and the same problem occurred.  After that incident I discontinued use.  The Diflucan never did resolve the yeast problem and for months after I continued to suffer from skin rashes that may or may not have been related.  Eventually the yeast problem went away by taking probiotics and an herbal Usnea tincture.	One single dose oral pill.  Repeated dose one week later.
65	flexeril	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	back pain	I had very bad lower back pain with spasms and considerable swelling on my left side, to the extend that when standing, I was leaning to my right.  Flexeril took care of most of the pain and much of the swelling.	I felt much less alert -- not tired or sleepy, exactly, but sort of like inebriated, but without the buzz.	Once the swelling and discomfort were at a manageable level, I saw a chiropractor.  Although his ultrasound treatments weren't particularly effective, I greatly value the information he gave me relating to how I should sit, lie, stand, helpful exercises, etc.
867	paxil	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression and anxiety.	Completely ceased all anxiety, and I am now able to participate and enjoy life fully.	Has made me gain weight and became more easily fatigued (all SSRI can disrupt REM sleep phases, resulting in less satisfying rest). During the last few years, when I have been stable and very happy, I have tried several times to cease the medication, including under the support of a naturopath. This medication is very hard to get off without significant side effects (including vertigo and nausea), however, as my medicxal professional has stated, some people just need to stay on them for a longer time.	I have been on 20mg (one tablet) of Paroxetine for around 5 years now, as well as see a psychologist for 6 months.
3262	zoloft	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression/anxiety	depression greatly reduced, anxiety lessened.	weight gain, sexual disfunction.	treatment began for post partum depression and continued once adjustments were made.
2858	albuterol	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	asthma	short term relief from breathing problems. especially beneficial when patient was experiencing other health issue like cold or flu	sometimes dry mouth but usually not to severe	patient had occasional breathing problems that impacted his ability to play sports and do other activities. this was exasperated by the presence of a chest cold. administration was as-needed to enable the patient to participate in physical activity.patient had ongoing tests with local hospital asthma unit to monitor condition.
4098	chantix	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	qit smoking	enabled me to quit smoking, I think it works well, and even better combined with zyban/bupropion	no side effects	Choose a future date to quit smoking. (I picked a date 3 months in advance)Start taking the pills a couple weeks before the quit date.  I actually started smoking less without trying.  Chantix interfers with the pleasure receptors in your brain, so smoking is not very satisfying.  I have now been smoke free for 1 month.
1138	methadone	6	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	opiod addiction	It worked but then I became addicted to methadone so basically it just traded one addiction for another. I don't take as many Methedone a day as I did pain pills because Methadone is long lasting so I guess it did help me.	At first I got painful headaches but that subsided after continued use. I do still have horrible constipation and  I have sexual dsyfuntion.	I began recieving Methadone when I was 21 years old. I started seeing a pschiatrist because I needed help for pain pill addiction. I began getting prescriptions for hydrocodone when I was 19. I have an abnormality in my lower back which causes me severe pain. I began taking more than I was supposed to for the pain and was taking anywhere from 20 to 30 pain pills a day. So I knew I needed help. That's when my doctor gave me Methadone. He gave me 60mg a day but I usually only took 40mg depending on what I needed. Over the years I have weaned myself down to 20mg a day and everyone even my doctor says to me that I should be able to come off of these pills easily but no one understands the physical and psychological symptoms I go through. It's so hard to just stop taking them when I have became so depended on them in my daily life. I have four kids and with out them I feel like a different person and it takes everything in me to get out of bed and take care of my kids. Is it in my head? I don't know but either way, in a lot of ways it helped me but in a lot of ways it ruined my life. I don't want to be addicted to a pill for the rest of my life. Now my doctor has stopped giving them to me because he feels that I can come off them easily at such a low dose but what does he know he does not understand what it feels like. I am at such a downfall in my life, I have to buy them now just to feel normal every day. I feel like if these doctors give them to me then they should help me with the withdrawals ao I can get off them. I still need help after all these yesrs. I don't have a car to drive to a methadone clinic everyday and no one to help me. So what are people like me to  do?
3175	prednisone	2	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	cornea transplant rejection	"60ml of Prednisone saved my cornea transplant.
Saved me from having to have another surgery on an already tramatized eye."	"The side effects were terrible.

I am also in a much better mood than when just on the antidepressant. I am less  prone to get angry ,irritated ,impatient and to ""fly of the handle"".I take it after lunch and it keeps me going till at least 8 pm. I accomplish alot more in a day. And best of all feel good about myself.Vyvanse does not give you that dropped feeling when it is wearing off."	Sleeplessness seems to be a problem for me but I have been like that most of my life . Vyvanse affects my sleep alot less than adderall xr .	"adderall 30mg. in morning .Helps me get up
Vyvanse 50mg early in the day, keeps me productive all day long"
2341	propecia	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	thinning hair	None	Severely decreased libido, brain fog/mental blankness, muscle weakness, impotence, penile shrinkage.	Given 1mg Propecia for ~one week in 10/05, noticed instant compromise of sexual capacity and an increase in anxiety & confusion. Stopped because of this experience, however did not completely regain libido, sexual function or mental sharpness as promised. Tried treatment again two years later thinking my experience was normal and would subside with continued use (as indicated in drug info), until the same exact thing happened. I researched the symptoms and learned I was not alone thanks to propeciahelp.com, I stopped once again and have strived to reverse the damages since to no avail.
341	neurontin	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	low back pain, radiating to left leg	To tell the truth, I did not benefit very much from this medication, even though I was taking maximum doses, the pain remained almost the same with or without medication. Maybe some people are more responsive to these kind of treatment, unfortunately not in my case.	I did not experience many side effects, even though I was taking many pain medications at a time, I could say very little drowsiness, but compared with other people taking the same medication, I would say I tolerated quite well the medication.	"My medical condition was the result of a disc herniation at L5-S1 level, with no compression of the nerve root, besides use of NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and Neurontin, I had little response. I underwent also Phisiotherapy, Ultrasonograpy and other therapy. I have to say that finally I decided to receive alternative therapy (Accupunture) and started practising Qi Gong and that in a few weeks I abandoned all medication and the pain began to ameliorate to a total recovery. 
I still believe that drugs are effective and are indicated in specific conditions, but I also Know that not everybody responds in the same way to medication."
3212	benicar	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypertension/high blood pressure	lowers blood pressure and helps prevent strokes. Helps the patient to function without the tingling, headaches, and chest pain that comes from having blood pressure too high.	The only side effects I felt was a drained feeling when my blood pressure went down.	I take one 40 mg Benicar in the evening because that is when my blood pressure comes up. If I wake up in the middle of the night and my blood pressure is up again from my sleep apnea, then I take another half. I have to drink a lot more water too, as this helps the Benicar to break down quicker.
879	paxil	3	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression/anxiety/ptsd	Loss of depression, reprieve from PTSD symptoms	Suicidal thoughts, disconnection from friends and family	I was monitored on a quarterly basis by a psychiatrist who prescribed Paxil and Trazadone.
1517	glucophage	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	elevated glucose	Decreased Blood Glocose Levels. Decreased appitite. Less cravings for carbohydrates.	Loose stools in first week of treatment. Minor stomach upset for first day or two of treatment. All side effects mild and transient.	Treatment once a day at night. Evidence suggests that glucophage/metformin mimics the biological effect of calorie restriction for life extension.
372	lamotrigine	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar disorder	I began taking this medication during a very unstable period in my life and when I had been rapid cycling and experiencing mixed states, and over a 2 yr period it greatly helped increase my self-worth and overall stability. It helped me to get control of my life and avoid the severe depressions I was prone to, as well as putting a cap on my manias. I still felt mild highs or maybe natural euphorias but they are not manic-y and crazy. I even started being able to get sleepy at a normal hour and wake up in the morning. While on the medication I feel much clearer in general in my thoughts, so if I still feel down or up I am more confident in my ability to manage it. I feel like I am not overly leveled out and blah like I felt with Depakote, more like I avoid the worst and can be in control.	After 2 years and stopping for several months then starting again, I developed a rash which my psych guessed was the lamictal, although i don't understand why it started suddenly after so long! I convinced him to let me try again, however if I develop another rash I'll be switching to zyprexa.	taken consistently for 2 years along w lexapro varying from 5 to 20 mg. occasionally risperdal as well.
2638	toradol	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pain after dental surgery	Pain, (which was not controlled by Acetaminophen w/Codeine #3), was reduced to a manageable state with Ketorolac.	Constipation and loss of appetite, which were of little consequence, but the NAUSEA was problematic. Pepto-bismol tablets were used to try to control the nausea.	Three dental implants were being implanted into the front, lower jawbone to anchor a bridge replacing 4 lower incisors and 2 lower canine teeth.
2272	lexapro	2	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	less depression/anxiety	weight gain of 13 pounds -- very distressing.	I stopped taking the Lexapro and have been trying to manage my depression on my own with yoga, light therapy, supplements which has only been mildly effective.
2581	lidex	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	dermatitis	The ointment kept the symptoms of the dermatitis(i.e. itching, scaling and cracking) to a minimum.  As long as the treatment was part of my daily regiment it was very effective.	"When I fell behind on the regular application of the ointment, the dermatitis would flare up within 2-3 days.  Unfortunately, the ointment fails to ""cure"" the problem and only treats the symptoms."	The application is very simple.  Just apply the ointment to the affected area(bottoms of my feet) twice a day.  The Dr. recommended I exfoliate the area regularly to remove any build-up of skin.  Following that recommendation I would use a pumice stone 4-5 times a week prior to applying the treatment.
893	paxil	4	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	panic attack and anxiety	The Paxil relieved my anxiety and mild panic attacks at first. After time my doctor needed to increase the dose to get the same effect.	The side affects were that I needed an abnormal amount of sleep.  The higher the dose the more time I slept.  Also my blood pressure went up and I gained a lot of wieght.	"I started with half a 10mg pill a day. It was the increased to a full 10mg a day.  I then went to a 10mg and a half pill a day. Then went to 20mg a day.
I then went off Paxil entirely. My blood pressure went down and I lost a good anount of wieght but not all that I had gained. I did have some very high axiety at first but then it subsided."
3634	retin-a	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Regular use of Retin A cleared my acne dramatically. Initially, I experienced and increase in the presence of acne pimples and moderate redness and irritation. This lasted for a couple of weeks as my skin adjusted to the medication. Within about six weeks, I would guess my skin was 75% clearer. Over the past twelve years, I have experienced only rare pimples which resolved quickly with little or no discoloration. One important note: do not scrub the face with washcloths or any other abrasive products, and use plenty of moisturizer. Scrubbing makes the irritation and pimples worse.	Redness and mild to moderate irritation initially. Photosensitivity (use a moisturizer with a high spf sunscreen). Seasonal changes can increase dryness.	Cleanse face with a mild soap each night. While skin is still wet, apply Retin A (pea sized amount will cover entire face). Allow to air dry completely. Wash off in AM, pat dry, and apply moisturizer/sunscreen.
3931	nexium	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	Total recouperation from a long battle with acid reflux and stomach pains.	Absolutely none.  This medication is so much better than taking antacid tablets day after day and meal after meal.	Following my initial dose of the medication it would take several hours for my symptoms to subside. They did subside in the first days but would return after about 8 hours or so.  After about a week of daily dosing my acid reflux did not return regularly and my stomach pains subsided as well.  By the end of week 2 I was symptom free. After I stopped my course of treatment many weeks went by with no return of symptoms. Since then, I have had one flare up.  I restarted my course of treatment with the same results and now have been close to a year symptom free.  I am very, very happy with Nexium.
3676	effexor-xr	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	major depression	Alleviated my despair, gave me back some control of my emotions and motivated me to work harder at managing my depression and get out of the house.	May have contributed to my insomnia.	Before I started taking Effexor I had tried Lexapro and Cymbalta with unsatisfactory results.  Having weaned off those, it was hard just to get out of bed - I was missing work and couldn't hold it together at all.  Within a couple of days of taking this I started to feel better.  It's been the best so far at managing my depression but I still needed other drugs to help with mood swings and anxiety.  Overall a good payoff, just wish it was generic!
1333	prevacid	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	indigestion	This was recommended to me instead of Gaviscon.  Supposedly it was a better solution for my indigestion.  Instead it was a disaster.	Terrible Terrible.   I already suffer from constipation, but I took one of these tablets, as prescribed, for two consecutive days.  After two days I knew they were a no-no for me.  My innards came to a complete STOP. I shall throw the remainder of the tablets away.  Four days on my innards are still at a standstill.	"Take one per day.

I have stopped taking them.  Don't forget I already take Dulcolax for my constipation, had I known these recommended tablets had a side effect of constipation I would have refused them.

It is back to the Gaviscon for me, it is gentle, pleasant to take and liquid.
Shell-like Capsules and me do not get along."
2415	synthroid	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hypthyroidsim	The benefit was a reduction the fatigue that I was feeling on a daily basis.	There are no noticeable side effects, other than that if I am lapse in taking it, I feel extremely tired.	The treatment plan is one pill daily, the prescription comes in monthly doses and is renewed indefinitely. Regular blood test are done to test the amount of thyroid hormone in the blood system.
3627	retin-a	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	adult acne	After weeks of use, I did see a considerable decrease in pimples on my face.  Being in my 40's, I saw a benefit in my skin tone also.	The cream is very drying, despite putting a moisturizer on after it.  In the winter, I sometimes cannot use it on a daily basis since my skin will peel.  In addition, I have to make sure the cream goes no where near my eye area, since my eyes will tear the next day if the cream gets within 1 inch from my eye.  The cream makes a person more sun sensitive also; however, I always wear a 45 sunscreen.  I cannot use on my neck since I got a rash every time I tried.  The side effects are far less than any of the oral medications my dermatologist tried with me.	After washing my face and allowing it to dry, I apply the Retin-A in small amounts over my cheeks, nose, chin, and forehead.  I use it every night, except when my skin is peeling too much from use.  Then I either switch to every other night, or put a moisturizer on first (incidentally, my dermatologist said the Retin-A should be put on first, under the moisturizer).  I rarely ever get pimples in the areas I use the product.  Even though there are some side effects, the benefits outweigh that.
96	pristiq	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine headaches	My headaches were less frequent, less severe, my PMDD symptoms decreased drastically.	When coming off of the drug, my eyes hurt (felt like there was pressure on my eye-balls), had severe dizzy and nauseau.	I was given the drug to take once a day to help with severe migraines that were triggered due to stress and severe PMS symptoms.
2770	duac	3	Ineffective	No Side Effects	skin probles - acne, balckheads	I could not observe any benefits: my blackheads remained as they were, and acne remained. Probably my problem was not severe enough to see the results, however, due to no observed change I stopped using it.	I have not noticed any side effects. Though I am susceptible to various allergies, I have not had any breakouts or worsening effects. Also, blackheads and acne did not become any worse.	I was prescribed to use 2 cream gels - duac and tazorac. I was using small amount of each: duac as night cream, and tazorac as a day cream.
2651	diclofenac	6	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pinched nerve from bulging disc & disseminated pai	The pain was greatly diminished and I was able to live my life in relative comfort.	It caused my liver function tests to become elevated.  This was discovered by accident on a routine physical.	I was taken off the diclofenac to see if that was the cause of the elevated liver enzymes; the tests were repeated about 6 weeks later.  They came back normal once the drug was out of my system.  I went back to suffering a great deal of pain and was sent to physical therapy, which didn't help.  I ended up having a nerve block done for the spinal problem, which has fixed the pain.  The other disseminated pain I have, was later treated very successfully with tramadol, 100 mg., two 3X daily, plus gabapentin, 600 mg, one 3X daily.
3045	seroquel	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bipolar/raciness/insomnia	better sleep, less raciness	tired during the day.  wetting my pants at night.  weakness during day	started at around 300mg and went up to 900mg but that was too much.  Then moved to 600mg and doing fine..  I think a person needs to find the minum dose that works to avoid side effects.  I am told that many people need high doses in the 600 to 800mg range to get results..
3874	levoxyl	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hypothyroidism	Started taking this drug in 2002 due to a high TSh reading, asymptomatic. Took it for 8 years raising my dose after about 5years from 50 mcg to75 mcg. Six months ago I developed panic attacks,speediness,anxiety,gastric issues,dizziness very suddenly with a sudden drop in my TSH from a steady 1.8-2.0 to as low as .20.  Continued to take the Levoxyl but dropped dosage back to 50mcg and hope to become asymtomatic shortly. Take Xanax for the panic attacks as needed. Am hoping to perhaps supplement the T4 with T3 Cytomel or something for the depression.	See above	Above
129	valtrex	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	herpes	I used to have at least 3 herpes outbreaks in the course of a year. These would interfere with personal time with my spouse, backpacking trips, day to day comfort.  In the time I have taken Valtrex I have not had one outbreak, and don't have to think about it any longer.	In the first weeks 2-3 I would have frequent low grade headaches, and a generally tired feeling.  But after I got used to the medication I didn't have any side effects.	Took one 500mg pill every morning.  That's it.
2574	klonopin	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety	I felt relaxed, could sleep, good drug to be lazy on. If I felt panicky and wanted to relax I could. I don't have alot of benefits to say because I think the grouchiness outweighs the good side effects to me!	Very grouchy! To the point I wanted to argue with people. Just felt on edge, relaxed if I laid around but get up and do something just mean and grouchy! I seem to want to eat more too when I first started it. Not when taken but craved sweets.	1/2 a pill twice daily for 20 days and 1/2 a pill when anxious. This treatment was to make sure I didn't get panicky and could relax. I did feel relaxed but grouchy!
2131	concerta	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	addh	patient took this drug to help with concentration and focus problems occurring in a classroom environment with many distractions.	patient preformed with better concentration and focus skills. also helped out in after school homework. less trips from the study table, more time spent studying, and less time having to be reminded to get back to work.	patient taking one 36 mg tablet, 7 days a week, in the morning after breakfast. Tablet was a slow release lasting throughout the day.
1646	estratest	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	menopausal symptoms	Completely stopped hot flashes and night sweats. (I think there was also some mild improvement in skin thickness as well but it certainly did not end cellulite!)	"Initially took full strenth tabs and I did experience some menstrual bleeding as a result. This did not happen with the hs tabs.

On the other hand, thanks to the increased amount of tetosterone in the full strenght tabs, my interest in sex improved on these. Not so much with the half strength tabs."	I had a salivary estrogen level test done while I was on this medication. Although it completely stopped menopausal symptoms my estrogen levels were still very low. So I'm not particularly concerned about adverse effects of estrogen treatment on these...
1997	vicodin	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pain from broken arm	"It took the ""edge"" off the pain, for sure.  Without the medication I don't know how I could have put up with it."	I was so out of it from the one pill, mouth hanging open, drooling, to take I had to cut it in half.  I also experienced digestive distress, and overall yucky feeling, not some blissfully pain free state. My arm was shattered..the bone was separated about 1/2 an inch at the upper arm, and a crack ran down a few inches to another break.  It was excruciating, but the 1/2 pill was enough to dull the pain to the point where I could sleep, and make it up to go to the restroom.	"The Vicodin was for the pain of the broken arm.  The arm was in a plastic type of cast and sling.  After 8 weeks I was able to remove the sling but the shoulder had ""frozen"" by then so the physio required was just as painful!"
4074	mobic	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	arthritis	Less pain in joints and back. Was able to do activities with my daughter  again. I stopped taking it for about 6 weeks and noticed a significant increase in pain. When I resumed taking it and symptoms faded.	I had no noticable side effects. I was warned that there could be possible stomach upset, and if this were to occur then I should take with food.	Three tablets daily.
2784	keppra	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	simple partial seizure	The benefits of taking all these asthma medications is that I have been pretty much symptom free.  The Flovent has been particularly helpful in preventing flareups of my symptoms which has greatly reduced the need for my Albuterol.  The benefits of taking the Keppra is that I have only had one seizure episode since I began treatment in 2006.  The episode lasted only seconds.	I have no side effects from taking my asthma medications.  I experienced a lack of enery or just feeling tired when I first started taking the Keppra in the morning.  I do not have that system any longer.	I take my asthma medications daily and will continue to do so for the rest of my life.  The same is true for my seizure medication.
3345	lipitor	7	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	Noticeably lowered blood pressure and stress level when taken.  If the patient missed a dose, he became more easily agitated.  When the Lipitor was administered, agitation would subside within 1/2 an hour.  The patient has a family history of hypertension, heart disease and sleep apnea.  Therefore, controlling hypertension is a major concern for this patient and may actually save his life.	Erectile function seemed to be mildly affected by this drug.  Sexual performance became slightly more challenging once the patient began taking this medication and was noticeably improved when the patient missed a dose.	Lipitor was administered in pill form.  The patient received the prescription from a sliding scale clinic.  The patient also received a cardiogram, which revealed a 30% blockage.  Alcohol consumption, diet, and exercise are the primary barriers to this patient's health improvement.  He consumes an average of ~6 alcoholic beverages per day.  His diet includes many whole grains and vegetables, but also a large amount of fat and cholesterol.  The patient exercises sparatically and becomes fatigued quickly during physical activity.  Patient smoked for several years, but quit approximately 2 years ago.
3510	minoxidil	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hair loss	Regained hair growth. Minoxidil first increased hairloss (normal during the first weeks of using). New hair started to grow after around seven months. I have not regained my normal hairgrowth. The hairs itself have a slightly larger diameter and are bit more curled.	Slightly increased peachy hairgrowth on face. During first week of treatment I experienced a minor headache after application.	Was prescribed this drug in a 5% solution by my dermatologist when suffering from Alopecia Androgenetica. He advised to apply a 1 ml dose twice daily.
370	lamotrigine	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	major depression	It started working immediately which was wonderful.  My energy level increased, I was more interested in going out rather than hiding in my house.  I've increased to 100mg 2x's a day.  I've lost approximately 25 pounds but I think that's because of an interaction from the Concerta & Lamotrigine.	Within 2 months I noticed my eyes felt strained all the time so I continually have to refocus.  I get tremors in my hands every couple days and can't stop them from shaking.  The worst - and the reason I'm choosing to change medications is the excessive sweating.  I use clinical strength deodorant 3x's per day but I can't go through the summer being self conscious of how I smell.  I constantly check my arm pits for sweat marks.	I started out with 25mg and moved quickly up to 200mg per day.  I increased to 250mg but found no benefit so I dropped back down 200mg.  If I didn't have the sweating side effect I would DEFINITELY continue to take this drug.
1799	citalopram	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Until 10 days ago never took an anti-depressant, GP encouraged me due to my fatigue, low mood, agitation and within 4-5 days I found myself much more laid back and smiling at people more, usually because something is said and I see a funny side to it.

My body responded immediately.
885	paxil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	I have had excellent results with the drug.  I no longer have a negative or indifferent attitude towards life.  I am generally content and am capable of enjoyment.  I am still capable of feeling appropriate negative emotions but don't get stuck in them.	I am not aware of any side effects.

Lamactil has made me very agressive and angry! I cry all the time and my doctor told me he wanted to up the lamactil, and I said, but dr. I didnt feel this way before. And he uped it anyway. I am not taking the new dosage bc I have a child who is possible schizophrenia but is too young for the diagnosis and two angry people is not a good mix.

I really don't understand the readings but initially they were like 140/90. now they read 120/70.	none that i know. well ask about. or re-read. Even if i feel a little spacey, it's not so much that i can't function. It actually may be the combination of the bupropion.	Missed a few doses while traveling. was reminded by slight headache which doesn't occur otherwise. contacted pharmacy for a 6 day amount. headache cleared.
432	imitrex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraine headaches	Imitrex has been a godsend.  After years of suffering pain and interruption of life due to migraines, just one little pill, either at the onset of pain or even when migraine is full-blown and pain is reliefed within 30 minutes.

1370	biaxin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinus infection with smelly nasal discharge	It effectively treated my maxillary sinus infection.  No more smelly nasal discharge and I could see the result within the first day of taking this drug.	No major side effects I could tell except a constant mild headache that did not really bother much.	I have had a maxillary sinus infection after a flu for 3 weeks and it would not go away.  The nasal discharge had a very unpleasant smell and taste.  My doctor first prescribed Cefuroxime 250mg and I took that for 10 days with no results.  I then went to my dentist to have my teeth checked to see if they might have been the cause.  The dentist found nothing but prescribed Biaxin 500mg for me to take for the infection.  The smelly nasal discharge decreased substantially after the first day of taking this antibiotic!  I continued to take this for 7  days and the sinus infection is gone and no more smelly mucus coming out of my nose.
3037	seroquel	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety/mild ptsd	Stopped the constant racing thoughts at night.  Finally could get some decent sleep.  Before I'd lay in bed for hours on end thinking and thinking over and over until I was nuts.

I have a job where I have to be 100% focused all day, and it's difficult getting out of the morning fog sometimes.	I know there are issues with weight gain.  Because of the sedative effects, this makes natural sense.  I would advise people to try to incorporate as much exercise in their daily lives as possible to combat the weight gain.  Also, if you typically take the drug at night, as I do, try not to eat at least 3 hours before bedtime.  This is hard, but I have learned it is a small sacrifice so I feel more mentally stable.
1387	benzaclin	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	reduced time to heal after an acne outbreak	dry peeling skin	applied twice daily but then had to cut down on the frequency as it resulted in very dry, peeling skin, and irritabble to touch.

1149	byetta	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	diabetes type ii	Byetta will raise insulin production in the presence of increased blood glucose only, and do so gradually.

Mild nausea for the first couple of weeks within 20 minutes of injection. Faintness and cramps if food is not consumed within 60 minutes of injection. Overeating will tend to produce sluggishness due to the corresponding large insulin release.

However, my arse is still in tatters and I've had to downscale from marrows to cucumbers in my spare time.

Very rarely, will have very mild visual hallucination if I am awoken within the first 45 min to one hour of falling asleep.	"I've taken Ambien 4-5 nights a week for the last year or so, to help with falling asleep.  Despite being tired at night when I go to bed, I find that I can't ""shut my mind off"" and need a little help to actually get the rest I need.  Ambien helps me get a really good night's sleep, but doesn't leave me with a hung-over feeling that other meds do.  I usually only take 1/2 of the 10 mg tablet, and that's enough to help me drop right off."
3223	nuvaring	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	contraception	Required only one application per month, rather than having to take a pill everyday. Was also a lower dosage than the pill, which seems better. Because it is not ingested there was no nausea.	Lower doses can lead to a slight increase in PMS symptoms such as cramping, but these can be combated with mild pain relievers. Sometimes can be felt during intercourse.	A plastic ring which releases hormones over a period of three weeks to provide contraceptive benefits. It is inserted into the vagina after your period, left for three weeks and then removed to allow for the next period.

Enough that I stopped taking the Diovan and went back to the higher dose of Verapamil...  I am over 50 and menopausal so weight gain is an issue anyway.

He stated that it was a more pure form of the drug.  At the time he stated it was expensive to get. At the same time we were finding out that albuterol was being discontinued.  The replacement had a horrible taste to it. My son who has severe asthma was even refusing to take the new inhalor. I asked my physician for it specifically at my next visit.

A ""generic"" has become available but is less Imitrex and more Naprosin, an anti-inflammatory,  which is cheaper for the manufacturer but not good long-term for the patient. My doctor is keeping me on the brand name. However, Humana has dropped Imitrex coverage, not wanting to pay the high cost, which never gets lower as the manufacturer won't release the patent.  Now I'm worried, having to pay the entire cost myself, which is impossible.  It's a horrible dilemma.  I can't pay for it and they won't.  What now?"

The first day, I noticed a decrease in anxiety as it made me a bit tired.  After a few days, I could tell I was thinking more clearly and did not have that 'doomed' feeling as severe.  I began doing more things and getting involved which helped even more.  After a couple weeks, my Dr. doubled the mg. and that is the current level I am now on.

3766	spironolactone	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	I am 28 and had acne like a 16 year old the day before the prom. It was horrible and embarrassing. This was an experiment. We had no idea if it would even work. We started at 50mg twice daily and then went to the 100mg when there were no results. My face is flawless now. I am also sleeping better which I don't think is a coincidence.	Dry skin, intolerance to alcohol, frequent urination.	I had brain surgery to remove what we thought was a pituitary tumor. We hoped this would resolve the acne. We were wrong about everything. I ended up having a very rare autoimmune disease called Hypophysitis. This is causing a whole mess of problems systemically. And when I say rare, I mean that there have only been 460 diagnosed cases since 1962. Yeah. So I have recently entered a study through Johns Hopkins. My treatment with Spironolactone will continue throughout my clinical trial and I will stay on it as long as it takes to keep the acne away for good.

1171	nuvigil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	originally sleep apnea	Benefits were I was able to stay awake during the day. And now that I have esophageal cancer I strongly believe Nuvigil is a big help with the side effects of chemoradiation treatments.	I haven't seen any side effects yet.	I have since been dianosed with esophageal cancer, I am in a 5 week treatment regimine with chemo and radiation and then i'll be going through surgery. I asked and was told it would be ok to keep taking the Nuvigil during all this and I am really happy that I am able to keep taking it. I really think it is helping me with some of the side effects from the chemoradiation treatments i have been getting. I'm right in the center of treatments now and I am suppose to have the lowest blood cell count now but I don't think so. I see the doctor today and get my first cbc done since I started. I think the Nuvigil is a big help while going through this and I think the doctors are seeing that too. I've been going to work everyday while getting all my treatments. And I'm sure that would not be happing without the Nuvigil.
371	lamotrigine	2	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression/anxiety	More mellow mood. Just taking Wellbutrin alone wasn't enough. I am a mild bipolar and needed something to balance out my moods. I have both depression and anxiety. And do not sleep well. That's why I was on Ambien, too.	RASH. ALL OVER TORSO. Burning, intense pain for days! Swollen tongue; couldn't eat. Lips puffed up twice their size. My doctor prescribed a 10-day series of steroids. The first night, I had to swallow eight steroid pills. The next morning, I had to wake up and swallow another six. Then another week of lessened doses. I have been removed from all of my drugs. Not fun. WARNING about lamotrigine: there is a slim chance of getting a horrific rash. I thought it was too slim for me, considering I'm very healthy. I was totally wrong.	Fully removed from lamotrigine, as well as Wellbutrin and Ambien. Now I am on Seroquel. At least, I will be on it as soon as I am fully removed from the steroid treatment. I will never, ever take lamotrigine again. Today, nearly all of my steroid prescription is gone, and the rash has reappears. It itches like bloody murder!
3733	lamictal	3	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar depression	The drug was very effective at first at getting me out of depression.  However it lost effectiveness over time and the side effects became worse over time.	Hair loss, extreme sensitivity to MSG and glutamate food additives, mood changes, insomnia, and extreme difficulty when attempting to discontinue the drug.	I was started at 300 mg and then reduced myself to 200 mg after six months.  I took it at 200 mg for almost a year and a half.  For the past four months I have been gradually tapering off this medication with great difficulty.
2908	tramadol	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	severe pain	Some reduction of pain	Became dependant on it as suffered severe movement disorder/restless legs coming off it, leading to depression and permant movement disorder long after other problems have settled.  This is now managed with other drugs, but a neurotherapist has indicated that the Tramadol caused a permanent dopamine imbalance in my brain.	Was taking Tramadol for assistance with pain caused by the herniated disk.  Was also having physiotherapy and anti-inflamatories Mobic.
1586	xanax	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	panic attacks	I had severe anxiety attacks and once they would start it was very difficult to decrease their intensity.  My heart beat got as high as 160bpm on two occasions.  I found the .25mg Xanax pills to be very strong so I only would take 1/4 of a pill, which was enough to stop the attack or prevent one if I felt one coming on.	The only side effect I experienced with Xanax is sleepiness.  I decreased my dose to 1/4 a pill of a .25mg pill.  I still got sleepy but not as bad.	I took Xanax on a prn basis.  Currently I am not taking it at all.  I was diagnosed with panic disorder and fortunately was perscribed Xanax.  Xanax helped prevent panic attacks and allowed me the opportunity to explore non-medicinal forms of managing the attacks.
1495	metrogel	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	rosacea	Metrogel 1% significantly improved the redness on my cheeks, nose and chin within 3 weeks of use and reduced breakouts of papules due to rosacea triggers.  It was easy to use with no drug interactions.	My dermatologist prescribed metrogel for rosacea. I experienced mild stinging from the metrogel. This is a very mild side effect and would not deter me from using this medication.  The results far outweighed the mild side effect.	My dermatologist prescribed clindamycin first for rosacea. I experienced moderate results from the clindamycin but not a significant improvement and still had significant breakouts from rosacea triggers. Metrogel rapidly reduced the overall redness of my skin and significantly reduced the breakouts in severity and duration.
2561	inderal	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	essential tremor	The tremor is most noticable in my hands, with fatigue my head also becomes tremulous. Inderal is the most effective medication I have taken to control the tremor. Benzodiazipines were tried early on and were ineffective.	I have not experienced any side effects from Inderal. At one time I was given a medication for another problem which had hypotension as a side effect. That drug and the blood pressure lowering effect of inderal caused a syncopal episode.	When I first noticed the tremor I was seen by a family practice physician who started me on valium to treat the problem. With the valium I was tremulous and sleepy. I saw a neurologist who diagnosed the problem and started me on a different benzodiazipine. It was also ineffective. I am a R.N. I did some research on my own and ask my family M.D. if I could stop the benzo. and try Inderal. He ordered it and it has been an effective treatment for many years. I only take it when the tremor interfers with activities.
3771	plavix	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	strokes	Since starting the plavix and other meds, I have had no strokes.	Terrible bruising.  If I bump my fingers, the joints will swell.	I've had one stroke and 15 T.I.A.s.  It is a genetic problem, but I have fully recovered from all.  The first was in my 30's. I eat a very healthy, low fat, vegetarian diet and I excercise regularily.  The meds I take are necessary, however a healthy, acitve lifestyle is critical.
1869	augmentin	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	ear infection	None/ had to many painful side effects.	Cranky, horrible diaper rash immediately following 2nd day of medicine, she couldn't sleep, they diaper rash and diarrhea came on very quickly and the diaper rash hurt her so bad it made her catch her breath if she moved a certain way. I have never seen such a bad diaper rash on either of my babies. I took her in on the 3rd day of treatment and had the medication changed and both of her rashes went away in two days. The rash on her body looked like round welts and they were very itchy. They spread very fast starting as a ring around her whole waist, around her chest and behind her ears. It was blistered.  It also looked like round mosquito bites the size of a dime on her arms and legs. They also lost their appetite.	This was to treat an ear infection in both ears. The side effects from this medication were way worse than the ear infestion itself. It was extrememly scary to see how this medicine took hold of my 1 year old daughter's body. My son who is 2 was perscribed this medication on Friday due to a bronchial virus, he was also given a shot of antibiotics and given a cough suppressent. The augmenton did not give him the skin rash but he has a horrible diaper rash and it is extremely painful. He is not sleeping very well either and also has diarrhea. He was percribed the medicine on Friday and I didn't realize it was the same medication my daughter had two weeks ago. I will be calling my doctor this morning to explore other options of medication to get him better. This augmenton is bad for my babies. I hope it helps other people. The side effects have definately out weighed the benefits of helping my children heal. I am dissapointed. It is tough thinking you are giving your kids something that will help them and then they are in more pain than before you sought medical care.
258	ultram	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis	Practically pain-free. Durins a flare-up I sometimes take a 50 mm pill in order to get more short term relief as opposed to the extended release pill.	For me, very mild. Mild stomach upset that went away quickly, especially if I ate something when taking the medication.	Diagnosed with rheumatiod arthritis about 4-5 years ago. I have occassional moderate/severe pain in my hands and proximal finger joints with swelling. Ultram helps tremendously with the stiffness and pain.
773	naproxen	3	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	juvenile idiopathic arthritis	The treatment did not affect the level of joint pain that I experienced, nor did it improve joint stiffness. I cannot comment on it's effect on inflammation as my inflammation tends not to be visible anyway. <i This may be the reason that Naproxen did not benefit me</i	Caused nausea and stomach pain. The nausea would alleviate a couple of hours before the next dose was due, and start within an hour of the dose. It did not cause actual vomitting, but there were a few occasions on which I felt so nauseous I was convinced I would be sick at any moment.	I would never take Naproxen again without having a LONG discussion with both a doctor and pharmacist.
2073	metformin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	none	"Well... what can I say? During the treatment I mentioned a considerable pressure decrease, and for sure it was a notable blood sugar decrease. I would recommend this drug to evedybody with sugar diabetes type II.

When I started feeling sick 3 days later, I called my Dr and ask for Tamiflu. I felt almost back to norma lwithin 24 hours.	none	Just took the pill and drank fluids

It killed him. He never recovered from this stroke- Right side paralysis and unable to eat or drink/swallow ever again
1827	yasmin	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	birth control	easy prevention of pregnancy.	Not many - some mild bloating about a week before period, some moodiness.  I don't think this prescription is the best for any type of PMS symptoms, but since I don't really suffer from this, it was not a problem for me.	One pill taken at around the same time daily.  The packaging is easy to follow - it has different stickers so that you can start the pcak on any day, not just Sunday.  This pill is pretty expensive, around $$50 per month.  I think some of the generics are much cheaper.
1605	hyoscyamine	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	irritable bowel syndrome	This medicine improved irritable bowel symptoms of cramping and constipation. No diarrhea was present before or during course of medicine.	There were no side effects other than slight drowsiness with the first few doses.  After first few doses I didn't notice the drowsiness anymore.	After suffering with worsening IBS symptoms of frequent bowel movements, cramping, and constipation for several years and trying dietary management of symptoms, the hyomax improved my symptoms to a manageable level with the first use.
961	sarafem	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	stabilized mood, allowed for clearer thinking, improved sleep pattern, felt less anxious, made world look bright again.	none -- no weight loss unfortunately	Started with 20 mg once daily. This worked for several years. When spouse endured 3 years of life-threatening illness, the dosage was increased to 40 mg taken as 2 20mg pills.
2302	lexapro	6	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	depression	The treatment benefits were marginal at best.  Mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases.	On the plus side, I experienced no major side effects.  The possible effects can range from nausea to sexual dysfunction, but none were a problem.  However, it is possible to feel a sort of withdrawal.	The pills are administered once a day, daily, for as long as you think it's worth taking them.  The prescribing physician recommended taking Lexapro for at least six months to get the full benefit of its normalizing effects.
3115	ortho-tri-cyclen	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	contraceptive	Prevented pregnancy, helped clear mild skin breakouts, keeps the menstrual cycle on a specific schedule, can alter cycle by having doctor let you know how to change your intake pattern for the pills.	decreased libido, dryness, breast tenderness,	take one pill daily to prevent pregnancy - must be taken at roughly the same time every day to be effective.

2338	propecia	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	male pattern hair loss	The hair on the crown of the head significantly and visually filled in to the state it was 5 years earlier and has maintained this growth since.	It seems that it sometimes takes an extra moment or two to finish urinating to avoid dripping. Side effect is not noticable if the drug is taken before bed.	I take the drug once a day at night with a small glass of water.
56	flexeril	8	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	sever muscle spasms lower back	It greatly reduced the pain in the lower back and upper thigh muscles.It reduced the amount of spasms I was having in my lower back. I could not function as well if I did not take it.	Increased heart rate. Headaches, feeling very out of it. affected my memory.I also had VERY bad nightmares. Upset my stomach after taking it for a month.	I was to take it at bedtime to help my sleep due to the pain and spasms in my lower back and upper thigh muscles. I could only take.5mg or it made me too sleepy during the day.

435	imitrex	5	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine	"Imitrex was the miracle drug for me at first. Suffered with migraines since the age of 7 and never got relief except through ER shot of stadol/phenergen starting at age 27. So when doc gave me imitrex shot the first time I thought I found my miracle. 
It does get rid of the pain completely. I have no complaint about that.
I used to only get migraines once or twice a month."	"A bit tired feeling...sort of lathargic or weak feeling.
Here is the bad for me. Since taking imitrex, the frequency of migraines have increased. I got rebound from this drug everytime I use it. It'ts totally ridiculous to find a drug that gets rid of the pain but I cannot use it anymore due to it's effect on frequency. I've tried all the other triptans and only imitrex has worked for me but I can no longer take it."	Again about the rebound effect. Some doctors refuse to admit that this drug causes rebound headaches but for me it did. I took nothing else...no OTC drugs or anything else for the headach. ONLY the imitrex. When I realized what was happening I stopped taking drug and just suffer through as I used to. That's the bad...the good is frequency of mograines are much less.
1063	botox	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	wrinkles, furrows	The furrows (lines above my eyes) on forehead disappered. They started reappearng after about three months. I looked younger. I also didnt look look like i was frowning all of the time.	The initital injection was very painful. I had a very bad headache for about two days after the treatment. Also after about a year of the treatments i started noticing lines on the sides of my forehead, which my doctor said was unrelated to the botox, but i know someone else who got them as well.	The treatment consisted of injected 2 syringes, one on each side of the furrows lines on my forehead. The doctor said I could also have them injected on the sides of the eyes but i opted not to. Probably because of the pain.
155	zomig	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine	allowed me to function rather than having to spend 2-3 days in bed	mild initial discomfort in the neck	Prescribed for migraine relief

Adheres well, stays on, minor redness after patch removal on very sensitive skin, but goes away quickly. Patch must be applied to a different defined (by the manufacturer) area everyday.
1021	vyvanse	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	adhd	Sustained focus, improvement in attention span and greater achievement of daily tasks.  Easy to take, just one pill a day!	I had no side effects with this drug!  I loved it.	Vyvanse is a new medication used to treat ADHD.  It is a time-released capsule.  It is easy to swallow (no bad taste like pressed pills), and does not upset your stomach.  I took one 70mg pill in the morning.  The pill releases the drug slowly, so ur not hit with all of it at one time.  This allows for the medicine to be equally effective all day, not just for a few hours. I did NOT have any of the normal ADHD med. side effects, such as: rapid heart rate, anxiety, jittery feeling.  The only downside to this medication is the cost.  Since Vyvanse is new, there is no generic for it.  I paid $160/month for 30 pills! I was self-pay though, so I'm sure having insurance would be ideal! Although it is very expensive, it is well worth it.
60	flexeril	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migaine/tension headches	Well, I started on Flexeril about five days to a week ago. I felt a calm feeling and also it kind of helped my anxiety. It helped my headches a lot.	I did have one side effects that was annoying: restless legs. It made me a little drowsy.	I have been taking different narcotic painkillers for years, and I just reached a point that there were too many side effects so I decided to talk to my doctor. He took me off the painkillers and tried a few muscle relaxers such as: Robaxin and Norflex-they did not work at all. I started on Motrin 800 and Flexeril, Flexeril is helping me a lot and I would definately recommend it to others
2089	anafranil	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	ocd	decreased anxiety	constipation and dry mouth	"I have been taking the medication for about 2 months and my anxiety from my obsessions has decreased significantly.  I no longer get ""fixated"" on thoughts and able to perform better at my job. I plan to stay on this drug as long as my therapists recommends."
786	ambien	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	not sleeping	there were no treatment benefits only bad side effects such as terrible nightmares, hyperventilating	see above, terrible nightmares, hyperventilation upon waking from the nightmares	i was supposed to take the product every night in order to sleep. i stopped after 5 sleepless nights
35	alprazolam	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	panic disorder	Control of Panic Attacks that interrupted daily activity. Treatment of sudden increased anxiety, tachycardia, shortness of breathe, due to stress, general anxiety disorder.	None	"At the start of this disorder I thought I was having a heart attack, was in the Dr's office with an EKG racing at 115 beats fluctuating from 85, short of breath and nurse asking me if I am ok. I simply told her, this is why I am here, for absolutely no reason my body is doing this craziness.  Panic disorder or general anxiety probable cause stress. I did not feel stressed so this confused me further.

One 30 day prescription of 0.25mg pills can last anywhere from two months to six months. As needed works great for me as when I know my heart starts racing and the adrenaline starts pumping for no reason, half of 0.25mg pill will offset that attack. I am also a smoker so reduced 50% absorption, is enough to stop the panic. I do not take this medication daily and have not for over 10 years. I only use it when I can not control the imbalance, if I can not lower my heart rate with breathing etc., I will then take a half which brings it under control.

I believe in my case it is more of an imbalance or even a food allergy causing the disorder, I am glad to have the smallest dosage alleviate the symptoms when needed."
3539	vivelle-dot	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hormone replacement	I began using Vivelle patches shortly after my hysterectomy five and one-half years ago. I have more stability in my moods w/ better emotional control. I have fewer episodes of irritability and feel more calm and collected. I don't experience any of the physical symptoms of menopause like, hot flashes.	I had absolutely no side effects from the HRT.  I feel wonderful.  I would like to use HRT forever.	"I apply a patch about every 4 days, even though my gynecologist recommended one every 3 because my prescription plan will only pay for one pack per month, which only contains 8 patches. Hello! That only covers 24 days. Do they not know that there are at least 30 days in a month?!  By the time the fourth day arrives, I find myself feeling more irritable.  My husband will even notice and say to me, ""Did you change your patch recently""? He even notices how much more 'even keeled' I am with it.I used the .1mg patch for 3 and a half years, then went to the .075mg patch for 1 and a half years, and have now been on the .05mg patch for 6 months.  The only reason I tapered it was because of the concerns listed in the research and upon advisement of my physician. I prefer the 1mg patch and would like to use it until I die!  I apply the patch just below my waistline on the left side of my hip area, then when I change it I place the new one in the same area on my right side. It's easy, simple and so-o-o-o- effective!"
1661	climara	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	menopausal	Climara patch almost completely stopped the severe hot flashes and severe vaginal dryness. It also has improved skin tone and elasticity, moderated mood, improved sleep (by decreasing hot flash frequency). The side-effect of pain in liver area from estradiol by mouth has gone away using a dermal patch.	The only side effect from the Climara is mild itching after removing the patch. Another side effect is actually produced by the progesterone I have to take to balance the estrogen, and that is an aggravation of my IBS - abdominal pain, gas, bloating. So I take the progesterone only 7 days/month now and the side effects are minimal.	After being miserable with frequent (20+ times/day, 7-10 times/night) and severe hot flashes (sometimes like a sudden sunburn, skin turning red and burning) for a number of years, I went on hormone replacement therapy. Estrogen by mouth had more side effects, so I went on the patch, which I have to change only once a week. The recommended accompanying treatment of progesterone caused more problems than the estrogen: a combination patch which is available is more convenient, but I found by trying it that progesterone really aggravates my IBS symptoms. To lessen that effect, I went on an estrogen-only patch and use a separate progesterone only 7 days/month. This is currently making me have periods again, not a fun thing, but I feel much better overall because my IBS symptoms are much less severe and less frequent.
1066	botox	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	facial lines	General anti aging effects on the face. Decrease in current facial lines and wrinkles and prevention of formation of new lines and wrinkles.	"Slight bruising,could affect facial expression if overused creating a ""frozen"" expressionless upper face."	Subdermal injections to various areas of the face, crow's feet around eyes, horizontal lines between eyebrows and vertical lines on forehead.
358	neurontin	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Neurontin coupled with a stimulant such as caffeine gave me a warm sense of well being and evenness.  However, the drug acted merely as a Novocaine to numb my depression and did nothing to help correct my brain chemistry.  That said, it was an effective enough band-aid that I suffered the sexual side effects in order to take it as prescribed.	"Sexual side effects included inability to achieve a full erection (when summoned) and inability to orgasm/ejaculate.

Softening of the stool- this problem lessened when I switched from tablets to capsules.

Memory problems and difficulty speaking."	I was prescribed Neurontin for severe depression in 8/09.  As of 9/10, I am still taking it but considering ECT.
1129	evista	9	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	atypical breast biopsy	It is supposed to lower the risk of breast cancer.  There was another abnormal mammogram & biopsy two years after starting it, but the biopsy was less abnormal. So no cancer is a benefit. There was NO improvement in bone density.	Major hip joint stiffness. fingernails thinned & developed longitudinal ridges, thinned hair & thinned eyelashes, dry skin, loss of naturally curly hair	As above, once a day.
4122	chantix	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	smoking ceasation	initially made it easier physically to stop smoking however still craving but know that smoking will not give me the same feeling or be as enjoyable due to the blocking of the nicotine receptors being blocked by the drug, so have not smoked.	Full dose made me extremely nasious so am only taking 1 mg at night.  Also, constipation.	Take 1 tablet in AM and one tablet in PM with food and 8 oz of water
3551	femhrt	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	menopause	reduced hot flashes; reduced heart palpitations	mood swings; not enough estrogen	I started taking the drug 2 months ago to streamline a regime that consisted of taking estrodial and a progestrene cream.  So far, I feel it doesn't have enough estrogen to regulate mood swings and dryness of skin. I also have breast tenderness and continued heart palpitations. I think I prefer going back to activella along with the progestrone cream.
526	requip	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	restless leg syndrome	I took this medication to treat restless leg syndrome and it was very effective. It made me drowsy at first, but once I took it for a few weeks, it just made my legs stay still so I could sleep.  I was told it is the same medication prescribed for parkinsons patients, but at a much lower dose.  I did need to take a but more as time went on, but it was still effective.  Unfortunately, I had to stop taking it when I got pregnant, since it is a category c medication.	I did need to take more as time went on, and I experienced augmentation of the restless leg syndrome.  The symtpoms would begin earlier in the evening and I would try to take the medication sooner, because if I did not take it before the symptoms set in, it was much less effective and would take longer to work.  That was really the only unfortunate effect of the medication.	I took one milligram at night to treat the symtoms of restless leg syndrome.  I had a sleep study which showed that my legs about every two minutes while I was sleeping and that brought me out of a deep sleep.  My doctor put me on requip to keep my legs still so I could fall asleep and get better rest.  It worked well.  I had tried all sort of behavioral remedies to help with my legs and nothing had helped until this medication.  I slept better than I ever had since I could really relax instead of waiting for the nightly discomfort in my legs.
1207	prozac	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	helped my anxiety, and overall mood.  I feel like I am less anxious and more calm.  I feel that my moods are more even.  I don't know what the long term effects are of taking this medication, though, and worry that I may get a stomach ulcer since I take over the counter pain relievers.	none really, but I have noticed an increase in tiredness	I take one capsule in the morning, as prescribed by the doctor.
3280	zoloft	5	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	post partum anxiety/ depression	in a very short amount of time all of my anxiety was gone which was worth the side effects. my depression decreased as well.	the most annoying were the night sweats other than that nothing really that i noticed.	i was prescribed zoloft in the past and it worked well, so my doctor thought that we should try it again for my anxiety and depression.  it worked very well in a short amount of time.  it was worth the night sweats to have normal days.

They would kind of knock the edge off my body pain but I had a constant headache.  My Dr. recently prescribed me Tramadol.	Nervous the first day.  No side effects since then.	I take 2 50mg tablets every 4-6 hours (no more than 8 a day).  It has worked wonders for me.  No more headaches and my body is only slightly sore now.  It has elevated my mood simply because it has reduced the pain.

1529	skelaxin	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	neck & arm muscle spasms	The Skelaxin aided in my recovery from cervical disc surgery.  It eased muscle spasms and tightness in my neck, chest and arm.	The Skelaxin would (at times) make me sleepy.  And it would relax my stomach muscles, allowing stomach acid to creep up into my throat and cause a burning sensation. The AcipHex would keep the stomach acid under control.	As a result of my cervical disc (5-7) surgery, my neck, chest, left shoulder/arm/hand and face have a tendency to become inflamed if I lift something heavy, I am tired or I over use my arm.  Therefore, I continue to take the medications to ease my pain and numbness.  Additionally, I use Motrin IB, 200-800mg, as necessary.

3300	zoloft	9	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	pmd	I was having difficulty controlling my temper, having loss of motivation, anxiety.  This helped to take the edge off so that I could function without the extreme mood swings.	I didn't notice any side effects except that it seemed to mess with weight loss.  Going off the medication for the periods indicated by my dr seemed to help.	I was advised to take the medication daily for the week leading to my period starting.  My dr said that through trial and error I would find the best treatment plan.  Turns out I usually take it everyday except for the first day of my period and 3 - 5 days after that.  I was also advised to take 20 minute daily walk in the sun.
3000	restoril	8	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia	I need to take this medication a few nights in a row which seems to get my sleep cycle back in sync.  After a few nights of sound sleep I can fall asleep quickly without the need for medication.  My mind is able to stop its endless racing/	I have noticed that if I do not give myself at least eight hours of sleep time this medicaiton will cause me to be very groggy in the morning.  I will have a difficult time awakening and getting myself moving.  Others tell me I look like a zombie!  So I know it's important to take the Rx w/in 15 minutes of lying awake in bed & not let too much time go by before I lose the 8 hours of sleeptime.	I have found the best way to take this medication (once I've had a few nights of my mind racing & not being able to fall asleep) is to take 30 mg. a half hour before bedtime which causes a drowsy feeling even before falling into bed.  A few ights of this procedure & my sleep cycle seems to get back on track & then I don't need the medication, until  another cycle of sleeplessness creeps into my life!

Didn't have any side effects	I had sex the day after I took the pill with my only partner.

Which was the day after I took mine... Is this y I still hav it? I thought it took days to work that's y I had sex
336	neurontin	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	chronic pain	Definite lowering of pain levels. Very gently, not like a pain pill. Several times I got off it, and about 48 hours later was in severe pain.	It makes me less tolerant of heat, sun. I have a problem with this anyway, and when the dose was increased from 800 mg/d to 1200 mg/d, I came near to heat stroke when outside.	I was put on this by Rheumatology, 12 years ago. Dose was 800 mg/d until spring of 2007, I asked for it to be increased. After the near heat stroke from riding the riding lawn mower less than an hour, I decreased the dose back to 800 mg/d until cooler weather, then went back to the 1200/d.

3651	retin-a	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	I really did not experience any benefits.	Skin redness, flaking, photosensitivity, and irritation.	Soon after beginning treatment as directed, I began experiencing the negative side effects. I kept with the treatment for maybe 1-2 months, and then could no longer tolerate the appearance and feel of my skin. It seemed like I was more self-conscious of the side effects than I had been of the acne and breakouts (which were still present anyway).
1163	zofran	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	nausea	cured the hyperemesis I was suffering completely with no noticeable side effects.	Because it specifically treats the stomach there were no side effects to any other part of my body.	I was suffering hyperemesis during pregnancy and was not able to take other anti nausea pills due to side effects and potential risks to the fetus. So this very safe, gentle pill was given to me and it worked perfectly.
891	paxil	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	less feeling of twirling...and more able to focus, and less distractability,more able to complete tasks and not flit from thing to thing	"insomnia and a bit of nausea for the first week or two only.

I have been taking 10 mg daily for some time now, and feel no need to increase to the 20 mg."
495	meridia	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	weight loss	Meridia helps me stick to my diet without thinking about food all of the time.  It seems that this happens in two ways; first, I do feel full most of the time, even though I feel some low blood sugar weakness that comes with weight loss.  The other part is that I just don't seem to care as much about eating, feeling weak, full, ect.  This is a nice mental shift which makes my weight loss plan feel like natural, like a life style change.  I just don't care about food that much and am able to think about other things.  Also, I have noticed that I when I am tempted to snack, I am able to see that I am usually emotionally stressed about something, so it is easier to think of another way to deal with my emotions and anxiety.  It is not a miracle drug.  I still have to stick to my plan and focus on meal preparation.  Also, it took 1 and a half weeks to really start working in my system.  It did not help my hunger the first week.  Just give it some time to build up in your body!	At first I felt increased nervousness and anxiety.  After about ten days, it lifted my mood and began to take away my appetite.  Then the nervousness went away.  It is harder for me to fall asleep and to sleep as deeply as before, but some of this happens when ever I loose weight.	Take first thing in the morning with breakfast.  I eat three meals with two snacks a day and drink loads of water and iced tea.  You have to drink enough for this drug to work.  You need WAY more water, as much as possible.  then you really will feel full most of the time.
582	acyclovir	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	shingles	The benefits were that the medication lessened the time and the severity I believe of the shingles outbreak.	I did not notice any side effects while taking the medication.	I was given the medication later than I should have been becuase the first doctor that I went to said that I was having an allergic reaction to something and gave me a persription for an anti-itch cream. I probably would have gotten better quicker if I had recieved the right medication sooner.

I felt the medicine only slightly cleared my acne.  I would say 30% clearer skin.; yet I did not want to stop taking it b/c I felt it would get worse.  I also took Predisone 5 days before my menstrual cycle, as I tended to break out more, but did not see a difference.

2492	remeron	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	ibs/anxiety	I had mono which went undiagnosed and that, along with other life stressors had me very sick and run down. I was diagnosed with Irritable bowel syndrome and suffered from severe nausea. I was unable to sleep or eat and began to lose weight. I had tried many anti-nauseants to no avail and began remeron as a last resort. My nausea all but disappeared. I only became nauseated when working nights. My anxiety level also somewhat decreased.	I was very sleepy at first and would sleep up to 14 hours per day. I was also recovering from mono at the time, which may have contributed to my drowsiness. I felt a bit dazed at first as well.	I took 15mg once a day at bedtime as it causes drowsiness and it could be increased to 30 mg although I never needed an increase. I took remeron to get rid of my nausea which was constant and severe and it worked. After 3 years I had a major crisis in my life and forgot to take my remeron for 4 days in a row. When I finally did take it I was incredibly tired and couldn't keep my eyes open all day. I felt stoned and the only factor that had changed had been the remeron. I decided to try stopping as I had not suffered from that severe nausea since starting remeron. It has been 2 months and the nausea has not yet returned. I have no other side effects.
1196	prozac	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	My mood was stablized, and I was able to take advantage of cognitive therapy.  Without the medication, I was not able to benefit from CT.	Mild sexual dysfunction;  nothing else.	I took 20 mg. of Prozac once per day, in one tablet.  It took about 6 weeks for the drug to reach its peak effectiveness, which is one of the drawbacks of this anti-depressant therapy.  I tried others, but they didn't work nearly as well as Prozac.
2666	prinivil	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypertension	"My historically ""high moderate"" or borderline high blood pressure (140/90 or 150/100) has been brought to normal (110/70 or 120/80) so that further, more aggressive treatment is unnecessary."	I have noticed my sex drive is somewhat reduced; I am perhaps slightly more tired in the afternoons than I was before taking the Lisinopril.	I take one tablet in the morning.
3933	nexium	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acute peptic ulcer	Antacids were ineefeective to counteract severe pain and inability to eat. Symptoms reduced within 24 hours and completely dissapeared within 3 days	None	Acute ulcer was the result of diclofenac sodium taken for the aches and fever. very severe ulceration,pain required tramadole administration. Inability to eat. Antacids were ineffective nexium resolved the symptoms within 48 hours.
212	elidel	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	rashes	helped to prevent flare by arresting inflammation at the beginning of condition. it was in a cream formulation which made it easy to penetrate skin and ideal for a tropical climate. it was however not useful when the condition- eczema or dermatitis flared up. it is more useful in controlling inflammation at the beginning as opposed to a strong steroid cream used more as a rescue when condition has already flared and has become red and angry.	none	at 1st sign of pink and itchiness use sparingly and apply emollients over. Once inflammation has seized stop Elidel but continue emollients to help rebuild skin barrier function.
3200	omnicef	2	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	strep throat	This drug worked as a treatment for strep throat.	Behavioral changes including extreme irritability and aggressiveness. While these changes started while taking Omnicef, they continued for months afterward. My daughter also developed food sensitivities. From careful observation, I surmise that this drug caused severe inflammation in her gut that we are treating with probiotics.	We are seeing some improvement with avoiding foods such as milk and egg as well as diligently taking probiotics and vitamin c.
1070	proair-hfa	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	asthma flares	I was able to breathe more freely after I took this medication and my peak flow meter readings were significantly higher.	I did not notice any side effects. However, unless I positioned the inhaler very carefully, some of the medication ended up in my mouth rather than being inhaled.	I was also using a Q-Var inhaler twice a day during the flare (I normally use it once a day.) My treatment regimen when I have a flare is Q-var at 2 puffs twice a day, and the ProAir inhaler 2 puffs every four hours.
75	flexeril	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	muscle spasms	Muscle relaxation took about 2 days to be effective.  Pain reliever was effective in numbing the sensation initially, but after 2 days relief was found. 4 days was far better and 6-7 stopped taking every day.	Drowsiness was an issue, but this did improve the sleep time which reduced stress and allowed blood pressure to lower.  I do not like to take medicine, but I can see how easy it is to rely on these to feel relaxed and numb!  It is frightening when I hear about people taking these every night and not think about treating underlying cause of muscle tension.	The two medicines were used in tandem to offset the excrutiating pain in neck and shoulders due to muscles spasms. Chiropractic care was also used, but the pain was equivalent to childbirth contractions and after two days of no sleep and increased stress, medicine was sought.  The medicine took another two days to offer relief that allowed sleep, but after 4 days the muscles were relaxed. Chiropactic care continued and yoga was restarted to resolve the underlying problems. After 6-7 days medication was stopped. 1 night of the following week required medication, but since, none needed.
3594	differin	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Smoother and clearer skin, believe it may act as a Vitamin A derivative and promote faster cell turnover. My skin had less cystic boils and lesions, skin was less oily and seemed more resilient, but you have to be careful with the dose otherwise skin can become more sensitive, and sun block is recommended with this medication too.	Skin sensitivity can increase if you use too much of the product. When it says apply a thin layer, it means a very small amount - it goes a long way! For me this  was the only real side effect.	Treatment is simple - after cleansing the face gently, apply a thin layer of the Differin gel to the skin before applying anything else, in other words it should go underneath any moisturiser or any other product you are using so that it is in direct contact with the skin.
1320	prevacid	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acid reflux	Taken daily, Prevacid successfully reduced my acid stomach symptoms to the point that they did not occur. I did not need other over the counter remedies I had used in the past, such as anti-gas and antacid medications taken after symptoms appeared.	Unfortunately, I became woozy and suffered dizziness after taking the medication, often requiring that I lie down and or take a nap. After an initial period of a few hours, these symptoms subsided. Side effects were sporadic and I tried initially to continue the medication due to its effectiveness.	"Prevacid was prescribed for my symptoms of acid reflux, which included some stomach  upset and ""full"" feeling after eating.  Although it was highly effective, I eventually discontinued use of Prevacid due to side effects.  I am now using over the counter Zantac successfully, only as needed, not daily. It should be noted that I am very sensitive to medication and often react to medications that are not a problem for others."
1037	vyvanse	8	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	add	High concentration and staying focused.  It took away my irratibility & aggitation. I feel very calm. I felt that It help extremely with all my ADD symptoms except that I felt depressed. If that makes sense. Weight loss.	Teeth Clenching for the first week. Scalp picking and chewing the inside of my cheeks. Very depressed. A little jittery.	This is a great medication for ADD. I've never felt so together in my adult life. My Doctor doesn't want me to take it anymore because of my side effects. I'm so upset that I had side effects on this med because I loved how it worked.
3670	effexor-xr	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/anxiety	"Helped with being able to feel more comfortable interacting in social settings.
Helped with being able to complete daily chores and activities. Also besides getting my daily chores accomplished I have more desire to attend social events and have picked up a few hobbies. Increased my overall since of happiness and positive outlook on life."	"At first I had trouble sleeping until my body adjusted to the medication.
I have more vivid dreams. Also has caused me to talk in my sleep and sometimes physically act out the dream while asleep. One night I was dreaming I was swimming and woke me and my boyfriend up because I was kicking my legs as if I were swimming. If I miss a dose and go to sleep it causes night sweats. If I miss a dose before bed I wake up with my clothes and hair soaked in sweat."	"I was started at 37.5mg for a week. Moved up to 75mg the next week. After a week at 75mg was then moved up to 150mg. I was then moved up a week later to 250mg. I took 250mg for about 2yrs. I had to cut back on the dose because I lost my job with insurance and could no longer afford 250mg prescriptions.
I tried to (without my doctors advice or knowledge) get off the medicine cold turkey when I lost my insurance. Doing that made me extremely emotional. I would start crying for no reason at all and felt crazy! I went back to the doctor and talked about my situation. She set up a program to slowly take me off the medicine. I stepped down my dose by 75mg every 2 weeks till I got to 75mg. Then I went to taking 37.5 for 2 weeks. Then went to 37.5 every other day for a week. Then 37.5 every third day and so on till I finally got down to none. I went 6 months off the medication before going back to the doctor to be put back on it. I have now been back on it for about a year now. I have no plans to ever stop taking it again."
247	wellbutrin-xl	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Helped with depression - did nothing for anxiety I did help me with my fear of crowds. It also helped me with my hopelessness I had been encountering.	Anxiety - Seemed to make me nervous and to make me irritable at times. It did not, however, decrease my appetite which is does for many people who take it.	Given for major depression.  One 150mg pill per day.  I still take the same dosage as I started out on.  I am afraid to up my dose because Wellbutrin can cause seizures in many people.

3934	nexium	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	heart burn	Nexium  is very effective for me when I want to relieve heartburn. I don't take it everyday, only when I have the symptoms of heartburn due to acid reflux.  The treatment benefits were that my stomach felt better, and I didn't have acid reflux due to the foods I had ingested.	I did not experience any symptoms.	The way I use Nexium is I take it every time a food doesn't sit well and causes acid reflux or I feel it'll cause  I take it.
1511	kenalog	2	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	I saw a moderate decrease of inflammation in some cystic acne lesions.  In the case of mild acne that is not cystic, the risks outweigh the benefits if the injection is not done properly.	I developed a prominent indentation on my face at one injection site.  This was caused by lipothrophy, or a shrinkage of the fat cells beneath my skin.  This usually resolves within 2-4 weeks.  Sometimes it never goes away completely.  I have also been unusually irritable and anxious.	A dermatological assistant injected what she assumed to be several adult acne cysts on my face with an unknown amount of Kenalog 10.  About a week after one injection site developed an indentation the size of a pencil eraser. On a subsequent follow up visit the doctor told me that this would go away in two to four weeks.  In two weeks, I have seen no improvement.  I feel that the docor did not adequately explain the possible physical and emotional side effects of this very potent drug.  She never said that it was a steroid.
1930	zithromax	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	bronchitis	I didn't receive any treatment benefits from this drug.  It actually made the symptoms worse with more resistance to antibiotics.  I ended up having to take a different, more powerful antibiotic.  I tried it two separate times with the same results both times.	none that I could identify	I was take this to deal with the infection in my chest.
186	adderall	9	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	attention deficit disorder	Able to concentrate on school, work, movies and everything else that might go into a day. Able to become interested in hobbies and follow through with them.  People treated me differently.  The horses even treated me differently!  This medicine changed my life.  Gained the ability to remember things from conversations to classwork.	Hair loss.  Weight loss, which is nice at first but changes to malnourishment after a few years.  Relationships changed because I was no longer able to be manipulated.	1/2 in the AM.  1/2 after lunch
2964	niaspan	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high lpa	"Niaspan definitely works to lower lpa.  I understand that high lpa cause plaque build up in the arteries.  According to my cardiologist, high levels of lpa cause ""skinny people to have heart attacks"".  My levels were in the 70's and the normal range ends at 30.  After taking Niaspan for a few weeks, my lpa was within normal limits."	Flushing with skin burning was the main side effect of taking 1000 mg of Niapsan per day.  The cardiologist suggested taking a baby aspirin one halp hour before taking the Niaspan.  This does eliminate most of the flushing side effects and skin burning.  I highly recommend everyone with a family history of heart problems to get a blood test for lpa.	1000 mg a day - once a day  Cardiologist wanted me to take up to 1,500 mg but 1,000 mg brought my lpa back into range.  My blood lpa test came back in the 70 range and normal limit is up to 30.  After taking 1000 mg, I was back in the normal lpa range.  Everyone with a family history of heart attacks or high cholesterol should have an lpa blood test run in order to prevent possible plaque buildup.
2027	protonix	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	gerd	Reduced excess acid and throat irritation, although not completely. Bending over still causes bile in throat.  Nighttime coughing still happens. Certain foods definitely trigger irritation.  Protonix was the last of 3 or 4 similar medications I tried (Nexium, etc) and all others had much worse side effects (headaches and dry mouth particularly).	Mild nausea at first, gradually disappearing after about a month of treatment.	basically 1 pill in the AM and avoid triggering foods such as chocolate.  Fortunately food triggers seem to be time-of-day sensitive. For instance, I can drink coffee but only in the AM.
2731	elavil	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	I had fewer headaches and the headaches which I did have were less severe and easier to relieve with medication. I have fewer days off from work and can enjoy life with family and friends without worrying about headaches.	I experience an increase in headache severity after taking the medication as well as nausea and light sensitivity. But I only have to take 1 pill, tolerate the increase in symptoms for about 1/2 hour and my headache is gone. And, I don't have the headache hangover I used to have with other medications.	I take a daily medication at bedtime (amitriptyline) which reduces the frequency of my headaches (significantly!) and then I take Axert when I do get a migraine headache.
2068	metformin	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	diabetes	lowered blood sugar	none	two pills in the morning and two in the evening.
2906	tramadol	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	collar bone injury	"Moderately dulled the pain of a collar bone injury.  Pain was still existent but I was so ""dopey"" that I didn't care."	I was VERY tired.  Felt like I was drunk almost.  Could not take twice a day as prescribed because it made me so drowsy.	Take 1 tablet by mouth twice daily.
1633	premarin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hrt	Alleviation of post hysterectomy depression and other post menopause symptoms.	Some headaches at the beginning of the treatment.  Some breast tenderness initially.	Three months after my hysterectomy in 1998 I was hospitalized with severe depression.   The depression went away shortly after starting the Premarin.  My doctors have tried taking me off of it on several occasions, but each time we try, the depression comes back.
2974	strattera	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	adhd	none	visual disturbances, weight gain, insomnia, anxiety, hyperglycemia, headaches, mild hallucinations, water retention, difficulty concentrating, memory lapses, erratic behaviour. these side effects lasted for several weeks after I stopped taking the medication, and my vision did not return to normal for almost a month.  my doctor said it was an anti-cholinergic reaction.	i started at a very low dose, to be worked up gradually. treatment ended before this could happen.
1081	effexor	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	I'm not entirely sure it was effective at all.	It was really difficult to quite taking Effexor.  I had all kinds of panic attacks and severe depression when trying to quite.  I must have tried to quite a dozen times.  I think this is a dangerous drug.	I took Effexor once daily at bedtime for 3 years.
2925	tramadol	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	post-surgical pain	Eliminated the pain without the mental side effects of drugs like Vicodin.	Seemed to be a very mild mood elevator, but that could just have been due to having my mood improved from not being in pain. For the first couple days of taking it I suffered moderate insomnia/waking up during the night. This went away over the course of treatment.	After surgery, I was offered Vicodin or Percocet but do not like either because they cause me to be too foggy mentally. I initially tried just Advil but that didn't work on the pain. The Dr. prescribed generic Ultram (Tramadol). It took quite awhile for the first one to take effect (more than an hour) but it provided long-lasting pain relief. I was a bit leery of it because I read online that it can be addictive however, after 3 weeks I cut the dose to 1x a day instead of 2x and then after 4 weeks stopped entirely with no ill effects after that.
3656	retin-a	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	aging skin	I noticed an accelerated skin cell turn over with the peeling and new skin coming through which is brighter and younger looking. With the combination of the Obagi skin care, my skin also became uniform in color overall and the darker or brown spots faded which helps to make my skin look even better.  I don't have much wrinkles to speak of except minimal ones around the eye area and laugh lines around the mouth which I did not notice any change or improvement on that.  Pimples after an initial phase of getting worst got better and during the monthly period is lesser than before treatment. Definite improvement on that!	Itching, peeling, irritated skin. Appearance of pimples on the shoulder and back of the neck if I apply Retin A on that area.	"Retin A applied with the Obagi skincare products at night before going to bed. 

Obagi skincare regimen:

3642	retin-a	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	sun damage to skin	Retin-A smoothed out my skin and reduced fine lines. It particularly helped the kind of lines that radiate from the corner of my eyes down my cheeks.  They virtually disappeared, and people remarked within a few months that I looked healthier, less tired, and younger.  I was happy with the results of using this product.	Irritated skin, dry skin. When I first started using this product, they gave me a weaker strength and I gradually was given stronger formulas as my skin got used to it.  The only problem was that if I used a little too much, even later as my skin was used to the formula, I would wake up with red skin that looked like a sunburn.  I eventually moved to using topical ascorbic acid instead of Retin-A, which works well and doesn't cause the skin irritation.	I spread a dab or two of the cream on my face at night before sleeping.  It took several weeks to acclimate to the cream. It did improve the appearance of my skin. I noticed that it also made what the dermatologist called pre-cancerous spots disappear (these were a couple of small spots that the doctor wanted to treat with topical vitamin A).
1792	citalopram	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	I did notice right away a marked improvement in my insomnia and no longer require the clonazepam.  I too felt a weight lifted off my shoulders and my disposition improved.  I felt much better than I had in years.  Little aches and pains in my lower back and hips which I've been treating throught the chiropractor, became more tolerable.  My husband was pleased and thinks I'm much easier to live with.  I didn't realize how grouchy and difficult I had become.	I have trouble waking and getting up in the morning.  My lips are very dry and nothing seems to help.  My mouth is also dry first thing in the morning, but improves as the day progresses.  I yawn excessively.  I don't have as much energy, I have to force myself to take an evening walk.	Dr initially told me he thought my insomnia was depression.  I was desparate.  The sleep deprivation was making it hard to function at work and home.  I agreed to take 20 mg of citalopram.  My insomnia didn't completely subside, so I still was taking clonazepam .5 mg about every other night.  After a month, the dr upped the prescription to 40 mg.  I slowly made the transition from 20 to 30 then 40 mg.

1666	climara	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	complete hysterectomy	decreased hot flashes	Wondering if changing generic could cause all of the swelling?	After all these years on climara patch the pharmacy changed my patch to the generic brand and I'm having extreme swelling over my entire body, legs, feet, hand, face.  It is awful.  I will contact my doc today.  Could the change from Climara to the generic cause this?
32	alprazolam	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	tinnitus	Treatment benefits were reduced anxiety caused by ringing in the ears sufficiently to allow rest and sleep.	Occasional daytime drowsiness, muscle and joint pain seemed more intense while on alprazolam.	Alprazolam used at night to reduce anxiety and ringing in ears, also reduced use of ibuprofen and tylenol as this may contribute to ringing in the ears.
3601	fluconazole	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	rash	the drug fluconazole was a quick and easy way to get systemic drug levels to fight skin fungus.

1130	evista	3	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	osteoporosis	I couldn't stay on it long enought to know if there were any.	I soon started having blurred vision, then extreme dry eyes.  I know it sounds strange, but I couldn't focus at work or concentrate.  The worst of all, I started having strange pain in my knees and hips that, I had not felt before.  It was not my ususal pain.  I had foot cramps, couldn't sleep real well. I had extreme hot flashes each day, however, those were tolerable. I am only praying that this will all go away.  I really did want to try this, if it helps build bone, but iw wasn't worth it, to me.	One 60 mg. pill per day.  I increased my calcium supplement to about 900 mg. per day.
3029	seroquel	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	schizo-affective disorder	A very good nights sleep is one of the benefits, found out that the sedative effects are actually increased in the lower doses.  I lowered my dosage and live the sound sleep.  it knocked out my delusions and hallucinations, hopefully for good.	weight gain is the worst side effect, but a small price to pay for sanity.	I actually ended up with motion disorders from all the other meds, the worst one being parkinsons for over a year.  I had to take parkinsons drugs. It was so scary drooling all the time and looking stone faced, no expression.  I dont feel any signs of this with the seroquel.
445	lorazepam	5	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety	Even split pill severly reduced anxiety, made me feel more relaxed, took away physical feelings associated with anxiety like sweating and racing thoughts.  Made it easier to sleep.  Continued to work for 12 to 15 hours after taking. Took away mental stress and cleared my mind of all worries.	made me very tierd even after 12 hours.  It was very hard to wake up even after having drak 12 ounces of coffee.  Throughout the day my mind had an empty feeling that made it hard to jump start my responsiblties.  I find it hard to get into physical activity such as going to the gym becuase I am tiered througout the day.	can be taken: one to two every 12 hours
3615	retin-a	10	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	acne	Face cleared up in weeks.About 3 mths. I started in the end of November and by mid February my face was extremely clear. I stop using it after my face cleared up, WRONG THING TO DO. Once your face has cleared you still need to continue using it so your face can remain clear.	I got a whole lot of bumps on my face from using heavy amount of retin-a on my face. You only need to use a little to get the job done. It's very strong and needs to be put on very lightly on the bumps. Excessive retin-a will cause you to look worse!	I love rein-a only because it grabs everything from underneath the surface and brings it out. It really works but takes time and patience. I would always stick to retin-a and never change because it gets the job done and theres no turning back.
464	flagyl	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	tooth abscess	It cured my tooth abscess, even though Ampicillin had failed to cure it.	Severe Nausea, occasional vomiting, feeling very tired and lethargic.	Doctor prescribed this for me as I had a tooth abscess of a few weeks duration.  I had previously been prescribed Ampicillin 500mg 3 times a day for it, this resulted in a lessening of the abscess for a few days and then its return as bad as ever.  Started taking the Flagyl and it made me feel lousy.  Nauseous, vomiting, feeling as if I had the flu.  Discovered that the side effects lessened if I ate something substantial (especially dairy products) before taking it.  I was determined to persevere to get rid of the abscess.  This did not begin to subside until the fourth day of treatment, but it did go completely by the seventh day and has not returned.  This was one month ago.  It is an effective drug, but very unpleasant to take.
3769	plavix	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	replacement of femoral vein in leg	This is supposed to thin the blood.  I don't know how you measure this.	The side effect that I noticed was EXTENSIVE bruising wherever the skin is struck or bumped into something.	After taking this drug for about a month and a half, I fell down some cement stairs quite dramatically.  The next day I was sore, as can be expected.  But I also had HUGE bruises in the spots where I guess I made the most contact or the most severe impact.  (I'm lucky I didn't crack my head open or break something!)One bruise was about 6 inches by 6 inches.
4139	percocet	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pain/headaches	Was effective in treating pain. That is all it was used for.	Severe Itching, Insomnia, Nausea, Vomiting. The Nausea and Vomiting would often last through the next day.	"All in all, it was effective, but not worth taking for the side effects.
Also, it is severly habit forming. If it is pain that can be managed with an over the counter product, I highly reccommend going that route."
2192	clonazepam	4	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety/insomnia/	I took it when my husband of 30 years left me and my 4 kids for another woman.  I couldn't sleep, eat or function.  The klonopin helped me sleep, which helped me function. I probably would have committed suicide without it.	I first noticed that I had trouble memorizing things.  It was the trouble with equilibrium and balance that motivated me to get off of it.  I got to the point where I was a little unsteady walking with flats.  I also had morning grogginess, which would gradually get better by lunch time.	It was hard weaning off because of the insomnia that insued. Once I got off my fibromyalgia got much better, the memory improved, and the disequilibrium slowly improved.
1692	ribavirin	10	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	hepatitis c	I am in my 5th week of treatment, and my liver enzymes did come down to normal, but I will see Dr. on 12th to find out if viral load came down.	Some days are better than others.Muscle aches, basically all the flu virus symtoms, plus afeww more.	I take the ribavirin three times a day ,which equals 1200 MG. I also,give my self a sub-cu shot with the interferon, in either the right or left stomach or thigh muscles, this can bring on the chills extreme fatigue, and some other side effects it really sucks.
2327	lexapro	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression	It was suspose to help ease my depression issues that happend when the biploar side of me was not in hyper. It was a new drug it was suspose to be very effeect. Not cause any weight gain. With very little side effects.	I had very bads nightmares for about two nights. The nightmare wre of me hurting my family. I could see myself killing my family it seemed so very real to me I have never experienced any thing like that before in my life. I told my husband to stay up and please watch me to make sure do not do any thing.So I did not take them any more	I was to take one 10mg pill at night before I go to bed every night. It did not matter if it was taken with food or with out food. Either way was fine. I had to take it at the same time every night. I was not suspose ot stop treatment unless my doctor said it was ok.
1820	humira	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	ankylosing spondylitis	Almost complete pain relief!  AMAZING!	none	This drug is amazing!  After being in almost constant neck and shoulder pain for approximately 2 years, within 4 days of my first injection of Humira, I was practically pain free.  I am also taking Etodolac and am planning to taper off this anti-inflammatory in the next couple of months if possible.
2816	wellbutrin	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"I feel much better emotionally.  I was unable to get out of bed before I started treatment, and now I am back to having an interest in life.  It doesn't make me nauseous, which is a huge plus as far as I'm concerned.  I like that it doesn't cause weight gain or sexual side effects.
I was happy that it only made me feel mildly nauseous for a day or so.  I feel nearly back to normal emotionally.  I was concerned that it made my hands quite shaky for awhile, but after a reduced my caffeine intake, that subsided.  My only complaint is that it makes my ears ring.  All the time.  It is generally easy to ignore during the day, but I have found that I need a fan and a white noise machine set to a high pitch sound (like crickets) in order to be able to ignore it enough to sleep."	"It did make me mildly nauseous for the first day that I was on it. After that, all good.  It made my hands very shaky for awhile, but that seems to have subsided for the most part, particularly since I cut my caffeine intake.  Given that it's an amphetamine derivative, it make since that adding another stimulant might lead to side effects.

It is generally easy to ignore during the day, but I have found that I need a fan and a white noise machine set to a high pitch sound (like crickets) in order to be able to ignore it enough to sleep."	Started out on one extended release tablet at 150 mg once per day.  After 4 weeks bumped up to 300 mg dose.
1957	lyrica	3	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	fibromyalgia	I really could not give any results as I had a severe reaction to the medicine.

2873	avita	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	There was decrease in my acne and my skin became considerably smoother.	Luckily I did not notice many side effects. I only experienced occasional flaky skin and a very slight stinging sensation.	I used Tretinoin every night after cleansing my face. After cleansing, I waited 15-20 minutes (as my doctor had recommended) and applied about a dime size of the medication on my entire face. I made sure to use a sunscreen in the morning because Tretinoin makes the skin sensitive to sunlight.
2594	buspar	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	It did help to relieve my anxiety, but sometimes I had to take a full tablet rather than 1/2. It did enable me to ably cope with occasions where I otherwise would have been nervous wreck.  I can honestly say that it helped me.	I didn't have any.	I only took it sporadically whenever needed. I only used it when I needed calming down when I was in a situation that I wouldn't have have been able to cope with.
243	wellbutrin-xl	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Helped my depression considerably.  Also, out of all depression medication I have taken since 1994, I have been able to stop taking Wellbutrin the longest before depression symptoms returned, so I believe eventually I may be able to stop taking Wellbutrin and not have depression symptoms return.	Basically no side effects that I have noticed.  Possibly slightly decreased sex drive but nothing compared to other depression medications I have taken.  Does not cause weight gain, and may actually cause minimal weight loss.  Supposedly may act as stimulant so recommended to take in the a.m.  I have noticed maybe slight stimulant effect.	I pill daily.  I take the medication in the a.m.
1715	retin-a-micro	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	The benefits were that the bumps under my skin did gradually get smaller and go away.  They stayed away as long as i continued to use the product.  An unexpected benefit was the my skin had a nice glow to it, like i had come from a facial and my skin was smoother, after using it for some time.	The side effects were dryness in some areas and peeling, even when not using it, a few days later i would peel. But just flaky, not terrible and no redness.	I started by applying a small amount every other night before bed, but since i was peeling a lot and saw results i started using less frequently.

2044	prempro	2	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	menopausal symptoms	Reduction of hot flashes and night sweats.

Some increased fluid retention in the hands and feet. Breast tenderness.	Patient began to experience menopausal symptoms in early 40s.  Prempro was prescribed by physician to treat hot flashes, sleep disturbances, and signs of early vaginal atrophy.  When heavy vaginal bleeding continued to be problematic, hgher doses of progestins were tried.  The result was increasing severity of the sleep disturbances although the vaginal bleeding subsided.  After the patient developed FMS, Prempro was discontinued by another physician and the patient placed on bioidentical hormones.  Breast tenderness subsided and sleep patterns improved.  Patient later developed bladder cancer, although no familial or behavioral risk factors were present.
1996	vicodin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	cesarean	I chose to take vicodin instead of an ibuprofin based pain killer because my holistic doctor believes ibuprofin  slows healing time. For me, vicodin has literally no noticable side effects, of course I only took a limited amount for acute pain, which was relieved 100%.	I felt no palpable side effects. I also was very cautious to take no more than what I needed, not only because it can be habit forming but because it can cause constipation which was the last thing I wanted!	I was instructed to take every eight hours however I found that I only needed a half pill and subsequently only took three pills, actually I took two and a half and stoll felt no pain.
3355	lipitor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high cholesterol	lowered total blood cholesterol levels. In particular, my LDL (low cholesterol) was lowered significantly, while HDL (good cholesterol) was elevated.	There were no negative side effects of this treatment	the cholesterol lowering medication (Lipitor) is taken once a day at bedtime. It was recommended that a full glass of water be taken with administration of each tablet of Lipitor. In addition, blood tests are required every 4 to 6 months to test liver functions.
4131	chantix	2	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	quit smoking	I didn't feel the urge as much as I did before the medication, but they were still there.	Nausea, depression, suicidal thoughts, vivid dreams	I built up the dosage like I was supposed to and took the twice daily dose for two days.  I spent both of those days unable to move because of the nausea, so my doctor recommended I drop down to .5 mg a day. On that small dosage I became very depressed and began having suicidal thoughts as well as very vivid dreams.  I went off the drug and then tried it again a few months later only to have the same depression issues. I'd rather keep smoking and try to find a new way to quit than to lose my life on this drug.
3017	cipro	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	uti	NONE	Insomnia, back pain, muscle pain and cramping everywhere especially my legs, joint pain in knees ankles fingers, throat swelling, throbbing and sharp pains behind my knees, heavy feeling in my legs like i was dragging them severe anxiety like i kept picturing myself dying and the poisen running threw my veins(yes creepy) and for about five minutes i was lying in bed and my limbs felt too heavy to move like i was paralized.	I will never take this TOXIC excuse for a medicine again in my life and i will tell everyone i know to demand another option. This stuff is pure poison. Went to the doctor today said i was having adverse reactions and sent me home with a new perscription although seemed to not fully believe my symptoms were real which I can assure u all they were and ARE! I am afraid of long term effects and this was only after ONE 500 mg dose! This is truly terrifying stuff
2710	prometrium	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	menopausal symptoms	Prometrium is a form of progesterone that helps ameliorate some common menopausal symptoms, including insomnia.	No noticeable side effects were apparent with this medication.	"The daily dosage was one 100mg. capsule, taken at bedtime. There were no ""rest days"" with this form of HRT. An annual blood test was recommended, to ensure liver health."
450	lorazepam	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia, anxiety	"I go to sleep within an hour and a half of taking it. I even get up to use the toilet around 4 am and I have no problem falling back asleep. Tried Ambien for 6 months, but I had to keep upping the dose and I still couldn't sleep. Plus Ambien made my anxiety worse. Now my anxiety is gone and I am generally more content with life. ""I can sweat the small stuff"", if you know what I mean. I did start Prozac about the same time."	"I haven't had any at all, even if I miss a night which is rare. My mornings are slow, but than again I've never been a ""morning person"". One cup of tea and I'm good to go."	I take 1 mg before bed. My natural path doctor recomended Lorazepam after a horrible experience with Effexsor. I also that 20 mg of Prozac at night also.
1234	asacol	6	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	crohns disease	Less flair ups of the crohns disease. Less diarhea and cramping.	no side effects evidentent	"I believe you mean the treatment of the disease. For me it was taking my medication Asacol, and watching my diet. I understand foods have different effects on different individuals. For me, avoiding foods high in fat, avoiding excessive sugars and high fiber foods (popcorn, nuts) made the difference for me. The drug w/o diet would not work.

Should stress be factored, that too, weighed heavily."
3295	zoloft	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	"Our home was destroyed in the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Before the earthquake, I was already experiencing depressive symptoms but was reluctant to take medication for it. After the earthquake, my doctor recommended I give the antidepressants a try for a few months coupled with therapy to get me back on track. About two weeks later, I found myself feeling good again, (in spite of my therapist telling me how screwed up my family was) driving down the freeway, singing at the top of my lungs and playing air drums on the steering wheel of my car. The ""Old me"" was back! 

Thanks to the medication, I was able to re-organize my life and focus on moving ahead instead of being stuck knowing what things needed to be done but not having the drive or motivation to do them."	"The sexual side effects ultimately led me stop taking the Zoloft. My husband and I found it very frustrating that I was unable to reach climax where before, I had been multi-orgasmic. Because our sex life is very important to us, this became an area of contention that I found to be unacceptable.  My inability to reach orgasm was demoralizing for my husband feeling he could no longer please me and for me the frustration of it all made sex seem like too much work to bother with. My libido came to a screeching halt. This depressed both of us so I gradually weaned myself off the Zoloft and shortly thereafter, became pregnant with our first child. 

One other thing about taking the Zoloft was that after the elevated mood from the initial breakthrough of depression wore off; I found myself living life somewhere in the middle. In addition to the lows no longer being depressingly low, the highs were not as uplifting as before. I was, in essence, comfortably numb.

Other side effects were dry mouth, nausea, weight gain, and increased irritability. , although the later could have been due to the stress of our temporary living conditions."	"My primary care physician prescribed counseling and the antidepressant, Zoloft. The plan was to take the medication for three to six months until I felt I was back on track and could maintain a functional lifestyle without it. 

I started with 25 mg every other day for five days, then 25 mg a day for one week, followed by 50 mg a day every day thereafter. I began therapy with a psychologist once a week where I was diagnosed with PTSD. Strangely enough, I found the counseling to do more harm than good in this case partially because it made me see my childhood for what it really was. I did not find that to be helpful at the time. Had I not been on anti-depressants before I went to counseling, I would have needed it afterward to deal with the emotional blows that I had to face and could no longer ignore that drove me into depression in the first place."
3447	provera	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	endometrial hyperplasia	the benefits were, I was taking it for excessive prolong spotting and bleeding. Slowly but surely everything did go back to normal, no more excessive bleeding or spotting but it did take like 8 months.	the side effect for me was weight gain and depression.	"Treatment was to be ongoing for six months to treat condition. I was to take it 10 days out of the month. During treatment I had break-through bleeding and very bad cramping, though I do not think directly connected with treatment. I gained weight, but soon took off through walking running and other activities. I went through a very bad depression, resulting in me taking another medication for treament of that. It wasn't until I went off treatment until everything got back to ""normal"" (no more excessive bleeding or spotting in between periods)."
2346	propecia	1	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	hair loss	Hair Regrowth	"I experienced extreme fatigue, anxiety, depression, gynecomastia, apathy, anorgasma, penile fibrosis, penile numbness, loss of nighttime erections and endless hormonal imbalances.	

I took this drug for 1 year and 4 months. The anxiety and depression affected me almost immediately although I was completely clueless as to the cause. I cycled through every single anti-depressant and ADHD medication trying to solve this problem. It wasn't until I stopped the medication that I realized it was the Propecia. THESE SIDE EFFECTS HAVE NOT SUBSIDED AT ALL SEVEN MONTHS LATER! I would not wish this on my worst enemy. This drug has literally destroyed my life. I know that no one wants to lose their hair and look unattractive, but just imagine how attractive you will be if you are one of the unfortunate few of us that gets gynecomastia, penile fibrosis, and inability to ejaculate (I CANNOT EVEN MASTRUBATE TO ORGASM after taking this drug). If you value your life then I strongly suggest you find some other way!"	1 pill per day
471	remicade	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	psoriatic arthritis	This drug has helped the pain and swelling in my hands and back from psoriatic arthritis. My fingers were also starting to twist, and this has helped to slow that down. The psoriasis on my skin has almost gone completely away. About a week or two before time for the next dose, a little comes back, but nothing like it used to be.	I don't notice any side effects.	I go in to the office for an inter venous infusion every 8 weeks for two hours at a time.
3504	maxalt	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine	Maxalt relieved all the typical symptoms of a migraine within half an hour and i could keep going with my day where as before nothing would help. Topamax is my preventative but i still get the occasional that will push through and thats when i use the Maxalt, hence why only afew times a month.	slight fatigue and drowsiness but not enough to make me go to sleep.	I take one 10mg wafer when i feel it coming as when it is past the point it doesnt work. Never needed to take 2
2835	singulair	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	asthma	Helped keep asthma under control.  Didn't cause side effects.  Was easy to administer.  Provided the outcomes we had hoped for.   Pleasant taste.	After hearing there were behavioral side effects, I was concerned that my child might experience the same.  There were no noticeable side effects.	Child takes a 4 mg chewable tablet daily to prevent ashtma attacks.  Previously, she used the granules which we mixed with applesauce or yogurt for her to eat.  Very easy administration.  Pleasant taste in the chewable.
3829	lumigan	4	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	eyelash growth	The upper and lower eyelashes grew longer, thicker, and darker.  There is less need for mascara or eyelash curlers with this product.  Lumigan contains the same active ingredient that Latisse will contain when it is released but the difference is that Lumigan is prescribed as a glaucoma medication while Latisse will be marketed and sold as an eyelash growth product.  It does work.	I developed dark under eye circles, itching, redness and a slight headache after each use but I was told that the under eye circles and headaches I experienced were less common side effects.  Once the treatment was stopped all of the side effects disappeared including the dark under eye circles. Also, once the treatment is stopped the eyelashes eventually return to their original state.	I was told to use it once a day at night and to apply it with clean brush.  It is important to try to keep the bottle from having direct contact with the skin in order to avoid contamination.  I used a new eyelash brush daily and Latisse contains once a day applicators.
3636	retin-a	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne, anti-aging	The retin-a seems to have minimized some of my fine lines, and has helped clear my pores, greatly reduced blackheads and minimized white-heads, and almost erradicated cystic blemishes altogether.  I believe the product does actually promote quick cell turnover based on the results I have seen thust far.	I have been fortunate to have only experienced minimal irritation.  Initially, I had tightness, dry feeling on my face, with some peeling or shedding.  This subsequently caused some itching, but, again, no irritation or pain.  I noticed when applied to active blemishes, the blemish seemed to worsen, become redder,and seemed like it wouldn't heal, but I have combated that by adding a good, natural moisturizer into my routine after the application.	I started using .05 % retina-a every evening after cleansing, but making sure my face was completely dry.  Only a small amount of the cream was needed.  I applied it carefully, avoiding lips and inner eye area.  Afterwards, I used a non-greasy, non-comedogenic moisturizer to minimize dryness, flaking and irritation.
1685	claritin	9	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	indoor allergies	"I recently saw my PCP for my annual exam and had 2 major concerns to discuss with her.  The first was some depression issues and the second was that I had recently developed indoor allergies.  As is standard my PCP recommended antidepressants and therapy for the depression and Claritin (24hr non-drowsy) for the allergies.  The problem is that I am nursing my son and no antidepressants are ""safe"" for nursing mothers (or rather, for our nursing children).  On the other hand, my MD approved Claritin although I was nursing.  At the end of the session she told to to start on Claritin and come back for the antidepressants once I weened my son.  So I started the Claritin and my depression abated.  All of my ""depressive"" symptoms were relieved (the inability to sleep at night but feelings of tiredness all day, the aches, the inability to concentrate...).  Since I started taking Claritin it was like a switch was flipped and the quality of my life has increased significantly.  I feel ""normal"" for the first time in a long time.  In terms of my allergies, the sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes have lessened but my red eye concern (the swelling and redness of the area surrounding my eyes) has not been relieved.

I share this in the hope that some scientist out there uses this information to help our elusive understanding of depression and its treatment.  Perhaps an alternative for postpartum depression?  Many mother's feel guilty weening shortly after birth in order to treat their sadness and if Claritin is approved by your MD for use while nursing, why not try it?  Or even as an alternative to conventional depression meds."	It ended my year long depression.	Please see above.
2884	avita	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	aging wrinkles	I feel that my skin is smoother, and hopefully the wrinkles will not get deeper as quickly as not doing anything.	The side effects were mild.  Seemed to be a lot of skin flaking/peeling at first. I find a burning sensation if I am in direct sun so try and avoid that.	The treatment was mainly to help keep the ageing spots on my face to a minimum and to try and prevent my wrinkles from getting worse.  I have found that daily use of exfoliating sheets and using an Olay thermal mini-peel or similar abrasion cream, I can keep the skin flaking under control.  I have to be careful out in the sun so I do use a sunscreen as well as a sunscreen powder make-up so that my skin doesn't tingle.

2825	wellbutrin	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Alleviated depression without lethargy, weight gain, a paradoxical effect, or sexual dysfunction.  Prozac made me suicidally depressed. MAO-Inhibitors like Parnate worked very well for me, except all of my favorite foods were forbidden.  Wellbutrin seemed to be the only antidepressant that lifted me out of my depression, and it had the unanticipated benefit of getting me to quit smoking -- I went from smoking a pack of Camels a day to not smoking.	I often would get pounding headaches, in the front of my skull and at the sides, especially as the day wore on.  I also would feel sick to my stomach early in the day, which would be exacerbated by coffee.  I got tremors. Occasionally I'd get migaines.	I took 2 100 mg of the Wellbutrin, 20mg of Ritalin and a 10 mg of a beta blocker (I can't remember the name) in the morning.  Then at 3 I took the other 200 mg of the Wellbutrin; at night I took the Serzone (before it was yanked from the market) and the Trazodone.  I took a drug holiday from the Ritalin over the weekend, but over the years I eventually increased the dosage to 35mg of Ritalin in the morning.

4078	mobic	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	arthritis	Pain reduction, increased mobility and range of motion.  The difference between how I feel with and without Mobic is astonishing.  Unfortunately, if I take this drug for more than six months straight, it begins to lose effectiveness.  Thus, I now save it for situations where I absolutely need it:  travel, sports, etc.	None.  My only complaint is that it loses effectiveness when taken over a period of time.	Took once a day, always with food to protect my stomach.

This had never happened to me before and as soon as I stopped using the ring it became easier to get aroused.  I also had constant yeast infections while taking this drug.  Before I started Nuvaring I had never in my life had one.  While on it, I must have had at least six.  I have been off of the ring now for three months and have not had one.

Since being on toprol, the headaches and blood pressure have remained managable throughout monthly hormonal changes."
4158	locoid-lipocream	3	Ineffective	No Side Effects	nummular eczema	Unfortunately this did nothing to heal the skin. It was an expensive experiment for the doctor to misdiagnose my condition, which was not sever but had been present for 9+ months.

It completely eliminated all nicotine cravings leaving only the psychological aspect to worry about.  So if I kept myself busy, the thought of smoking would never even enter my mind.	For the first week or so, I was slightly hyperactive and had some trouble sleeping.  That problem went away with some adjustment in the time I took the drug as well as with my bodies assimilation of the drug.  I also had a mildly bad taste in my mouth.  That too faded away.

Before my 2 week quit date had even arrived, I noticed a marked decrease in nicotine withdrawl episodes.  I just didn't need to smoke.

I had palpitations, nausea, uncontrolable shaking, severe headache and felt strangely detatched from the world (it was as if I was watching the world through a dense fog).	"This was my Psychiatrist and GP`s last hope of treating my depression with medication, and I was told that I probably would suffer no adverse effects (""very rare"", apparently).

My doctor advised that there is no risk in taking the medication long term, so I plan to continue its prophylactic effect.	Dry nasal passages are the major side effect.  This is no so bad, since I use a nasal moisturizer to help with this side effect.  I do notice that when I take singular at bedtime I experience tingling in my legs, and when I don't take it, there is none...so this may be a possible side effect.  I experience dry lips, but not sure if that is a result of taking singular.	Not sure what this means...I am surprised and happy with prevention of allergy symptoms.  I see my allergist once a year to be sure that it is safe and can be taken with other meds.

My insurance would not cover it and I started using fosinopril. I didnt think I had adverse effects from it until someone pointed out my dry constant cough.

2008	vicodin	5	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	pain management	Initial dose was highly effective for pain relief.  It took effect within 30 minutes and lasted several hours.

Dry mouth (which is great because I now drink a lot of water instead of sodas because the sodas don't quinch my thirst)	I have been on antidepression meds for 15 years, but my depression persisted regardless of the treatment.  I used to sleep 12-16 hours per day and was always tired and fatigued when awake.  I was diagnosed with sleep apnea 5 years ago, but even sleeping with CPAP did not help with my daytime fatigue.  After seeing MANY family practitioners, I finally broke down and INVESTED in a very well educated Psychiatrist who diagnoed me with ADD since childhood.  His decision to prescribe Vyvanse was brilliant!  I feel better than ever and am totally clear headed and able to consentrate.  For the first time in as long as I can remember, I can think normally!  No more racing thoughts in my head, and my depression and anxiety has all but vanashed!  I do still take an antidepressive, but I am CERTAIN that the Vyvanse gave the antidepression meds the ability to work.  I can FINALLY sleep a normal 7 to 9 hours and still be awake and alert throughout my 12-hour work days.  I was worried that the Vyvanse would elevate my anxiety level, but the opposite occured!  My anxiety is all but absent, and I no longer have the need to continue with my anti-anxiety meds!  There is NO SUBSTITUTE for a Doctor who is a specialist in mental health.  Spend the money and see!  A good Psychiatrist will spend HOURS with you before making a diagnosis, and if Adult ADD is what you have, then give Vyvanse a try.  It worked GREAT for me and my live has turned around for the better.  It is the best remedy that I have found in 15 years!  You MUST take it when you awaken for your day, because it takes about 12-15 hours to get out of your system.  If you take it later in the day - you will experaince insomnia.  Ask your SPECIALIST about Vyvanse...
2890	elmiron	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	interstitial cystitis	relief of symptoms of Interstitial cystitis, including pain and frequency of urination	Initially - feeling of wooziness, nausea, tiredness.  This wore off after 6-8 weeks.	Relieved my symptoms of  Interstitial Cystitis significantly after 1 year or so on the drug.  Even within 3 months it greatly reduced the pain associated with the disease and decreased the number of times I had to use the bathroom from  40 per day to <20 per day. With continued use, I believe it helped reduce inflammation/mast cell production in my bladder, and along with dietary changes and treatment for infections to my bladder wall lining caused by Lyme disease related organisms, Elmiron allowed my bladder to heal to some degree, reducing my symptoms further and my incidence of urinating to <10 times per day on average.

When the dosage was upped to 40 mg, there was dramatic reductio of the edema. Then I had mitral valve surgery and took no Furosemide for a while, but eventually the edema returned and the 20 mg dosage helps some. (see side effects)	I am not aware of any most of the time. However, after my surgery they kept me on 40 mg and I began having dizziness and severe general malaise in the mornings after taking it. (See treatment details.)	When I began having the side effects after surgery, the doctor took me off of the Furosemide and the side effect immediately disappeared, and I also had no edema for a few weeks. The doctor then put me back on the 20 mg dosage, which I still take. It seems to help sometimes, but not all of the time.
3152	prednisone	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pneumonia	decreased chest inflammation	temporary  jitters, insomnia, mild nausea	I became congested in the chest and started with over the counter Mucinex. I got worse in a few days and a fever started. I went to the emergency room and they used a large inhaler device which quickly cleared much of the congestion. After that, I took the antibiotic along with the prednisone, the portable inhaler and 1 months bed rest. I returned to work and stopped drinking coffee.
1315	prevacid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	Taken each morning 30 minutes before eating, keep me from having any acid reflux.  One daily dosage worked for the entire day.  Even into the evening, if I ate spicy food or chocolate, I could go to bed without experiencing any heart burn.	None that I have encountered.	I have been taking meds for my acid reflux for many years, originally Omeprazole (generic for Prilosec).  However, becaus Omeprazole was not on my insurance drug formulary, I was taking Prilosec OTC.  At my last check-up my doctor prescribed the Prevacid and I like it.  It even tastes like strawberries!
915	paxil	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Alleviated symptoms of clinical depression. Prior to treatment, experienced a severe episode of clinical depression that included acute symptoms such as insomnia, loss of apetite, loss of interest in life and people, suicidal ideation. After taking the drug for less than two weeks, I returned to a normal state of thinking, feeling, and functioning (which included alleviation of negative symptoms of depression and return to goal-oriented behavior and general sense of well-being.	delay in the onset of orgasm during sexual activity; a certain degree of loss of inhibition in social situations that occasionally lead to audatious behavior (e.g., what might be called as assertiveness in a previously shy individual, such as speaking my mind when I disagreed with something or someone and sometimes appearing rude or overly opinionated)	Upon diagnosis of severe clinical depression, was put on 10 mg of Paxil for a week which did not produce any improvement (was still debilitated and unable to think, feel, or function normally). Dose was subsequently increased to 30 mg which produced the effect described above (treatment benefits). Medication was reduced after 2 years to a maintenance dose of 20 mg, and a year later to 10 mg. A traumatic life event resulted in a subsequent episode of severe clinical depression. The dosage was again increased to 30 mg and again resulted in the treatment benefits described above.
701	accutane	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	The primary benefit was a reduction in acne. I would note that my acne returned several years later and I did a second course of Accutane. Since then my skin has been pretty clear (but I still have occasional breakouts).	Extreme skin dryness and redness.	Was prescribed a course of Accutane. Took daily for 6 months. Was very effective.
2399	synthroid	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypothyroidism	"helped with stopping hair falling out and keeping from being cold all the time.
also helped the feeling of being tired allthetime and gave more energy throughtout the day.  Did not feel as tired in the afternoon as before without it."	hungry all the time.  Did gain weight on the medication although it had been thought that it would help lose weight to some extent.  This however did not happen.  Weight gain of 25 pounds over 4 years did occur.	take one 100mcg tablet each morning each day
466	flagyl	2	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	vaginal yeast infection	no benefit	severe nausea, periods of headache, loss of appetite, horrible taste in mouth (it woke me up 4 times at night), loss of taste	Had an ongoing yeast infection that would NOT go away. So the Dr is trying this med.  It is terrible.  The pharmacist said any use of perfume, mouthwash or anything with any type of alcohol makes the side effects much worse.  I don't use any of those things so he said discontinue use and contact physician.
1025	vyvanse	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	add	"Slight eurphoria and ""high"" felt good but not what I was trying to treat"	aggravated acne, short term memory loss, loss of cognitive abilities	Most recently diagnosed with adult add, never tried add medications before. Tried to give it time to work as many people say side effects get better but could not deal with the major facial skin breakouts.
363	neurontin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	neck/shoulder spasms	Decreased number of spasms and pain associated with the spasms.	The only side effect i have experienced was apin over my entire body due to weaning off the medication. Nuerontin must be weaned off very carefully with the help of a PCP.	I first started on 100mg a day and the next day i could feel aldifference in my body. I had less fatigue and my spasms were not as extreme as they had been. My specialist increased my dose to 600mg 3x a day. I have been on the dose for 5 yrs and have had little to no neck and shoulder spasms.  I wish i had know about this treatment yrs ago.  I would have lived in a pain free environment and would have been much happier.
3149	tylenol	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	muscle strain	Had a pulled muscle in my leg, took Tylenol four times a day for two weeks along with ice twenty minutes four times a day for 4 days.  Pain and inflammation went away gradually over the two week period.  Took the Tylenol with food to protect the gastic lining of my stomach, also.  Now am back to running and jogging as before the injury.	Took the Tylenol with food to protect the gastic lining, with no noticed side effects at all.	Took Tylenol four times a day with food ( a lite snack) and used ice on the sore area as noted above.
1853	augmentin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bronchial infection	cleared the condition completely.   Augmentin worked after other antibiotics did not.   The infection was resistant to other antibiotics.	stomach upset at times from Augmentin.  Otherwise not really any reaction.	Two pills at 875 MG a day.  This lasted for a month.  Again my bronchial infection was resistant, or the doctor said I'd come down with the infection again [this happened in the spring two years ago, when there was a very resistant virus or infection going around and people were coming down with an infection again].  After two weeks of a regular antibiotic [azithroymicin] I was not getting better so the doctor put me on Augmentin.  It completely zapped what I had and I got over it.
3932	nexium	1	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	acid reflux, gerd	The Nexium was effective in stopping my heart burn.	I had severe side effects.  I itched all over, broke out in hives.  I had chest pain and swelling of the lips and eyes.  I had to immediately take benedril to stop the drug reactions.  I felt nausiated for days after the adverse drug reaction.	I had been taking Prevacid for years with success and no adverse drug reactions. I had to switch because my insurance would not pay for the Prevacid any more because there was a Generic form of Prevacid.  I tried the generic but it was not effective so I was given the prescription for Nexium.  The Nexium was effective but I was highly allergic to it.
1352	crestor	8	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	high cholesterol	lowered my cholesterol level over time; reduced the severity of dietary changes I needed to make for the same effect; reduced my anxiety about my potential risk of cardiac and cerebrovacular problems/events	I have not noticed any side effects; I am aware of the potential side effects and alert to symptoms of same.	one tablet daily, no other sepcifications. I take all meds on retiring. I also take fish oil capsules.
1369	biaxin	7	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	strep throat	It worked quickly--within two days my sore throat began to feel better and the night sweats disappeared.	Dry mouth, yeast infection	The drug did not fully get rid of strep throat. After the 10 day supply was exhausted, strep throat reappeared and was treated successfully with levaquin for 14 days.
3576	differin	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Differin does help reduce the number of pimples for an acne patient.  It did not eliminate them in my case, but reduced them by about 50%.	Dryness and flakiness were the two most common side effects that I experienced. In addition, my skin became more sensitive to environmental stresses like wind, cold, and sun.  Consequently my face often appeared flush.	I used a non-soap cleanser to wash my face twice daily.  In the morning, I followed this with an application of Persa Gel and then a sunscreen.  In the evening after washing my face, I would apply a moisturizer, then the Differin, and then spot treated pimples with Persa Gel.
2081	metformin	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pcos	I noticed that I was feeling better and my menstrual cycle was more regular. My skin cleared up as well and I felt more energetic.	There are times that I would feel nauseous and diarrhea. Another thing that bothered me with this medicine is the smell of the pills, it made me really nauseous and disgusted, I have to plug my nose to take them.	If you do not eat right and take the medicine, I think there is no point. My advice would be to eat healthy, exercise (even if you just walk) and take this medicine you will see results.
3465	ambien-cr	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	insomnia	Immediate ability to fall asleep and stay asleep.  No side effects in the morning.	I have to take the drup on an empty stomach.  Very bad side effects if taken with alcohol.  Taken alone, side effects were increased night eating and loss of memory after taking the medication.  If you do not go to sleep immediately you may drive or do things without using good sense.	Treatment is 12.5 miligrams for an indefinate period of time.
4118	chantix	4	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	smoking cessation	Chantix was incredibly effective for the purpose of smoking cessation. While users are advised that initiative must be taken on their part to successfully quit smoking, I felt that the drug decreased the desire for nicotine so effectively, making smoking absolutely repellent, that a patient taking the drug would most likely quit without much active effort.	Vivid dreams, often lasting throughout the night, not necessarily disturbing, as some have reported, but (seemingly) long, deep, and realistic. Perhaps for this reason, I did not awake feeling well-rested while taking the drug. Significant loss of appetite occurred, but sugary foods seemed more appealing. Mood became depressed to the point that suicidal thoughts occurred.	"Began taking a low-dose as part of the ""starter pack."" Desire to smoke diminished quickly and was gone within only a few days. Dose gradually increased to 2 1.0mg tablets/day. Continued with this dosage for close to two months at which time I stopped taking the drug due to the side effects listed above. Have since started smoking again."
1535	levitra	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	erictile dysfunction	I have used this drug for several months. For me it lasts a long time, even into the next morning, BUT it seemed to take longer, on me anyway, than Viagra did, more like 2 hours before it worked at all. I would recommend this to anyone that does not need it to take effect quickly.	I have not seen any side effects at all with Lavitra	I was having a difficult time maintaining an erection, however this works great. I am very pleased.
1040	vyvanse	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	add	I am finally able to focus, concentrate on tasks, and able to stay on track at work. Before Vyvanse - I jumped from task to task without completing one prior to starting another.	Loss of appetite, anxiety when Vyvanse was wearing off. I have no side effects at present.	Prescribed for adult ADD. I take one per day - 40mg.
2749	micardis	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	high blood pressure	Reduced blood pressure. Since takink telmisartan my blood pressure levels went down to normal. I could do my regular activities, including sports.	Reduced sex drive, erectile disfunction. Constant respiratory infection. Since taking telmisartan i have been constantly with intense colds and respiratory tract infections. Plus my sexual drive has reduced considerably. I am not interested in sex and when I had to have sexual relations i experienced difficulty maintaining an erection.	Only medication was prescribed. temisartan 80 mg a day. I have benn taking it for more than 5 months.
3904	nexium	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	NO MORE HEART BURN OR ACID REFLUX	NO SIDE EFFECTS	WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS
3023	cipro	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	infection	suppose to get rid of difittulitis which after colonoscophy I did not have. Took the drug for nothing. There were no benefits. The slight pain I had in the lower left side I still always have	rash for monthe. loose skin all over body.I have lost the collegen in my skin and now get a reaction to any antibiotic I take.	horrible prescribed way too long
83	zovirax-topical	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	shingles	taken at a stage where puss filled blisters were swollen, ensured a quick and painless transition from this stage to a stage where blisters became dry. Not much effect for 5 days or so, however when the blisters did dry up they did so quickly and was not painful at all which is what i had expected. fairly easy to apply and good consistency for application.	None	applied directly onto affected area 3 times a day. chose to apply generously and cover effected area with a bandage.
79	niacor	3	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	high cholesterol	I was not willing to deal with the effects of the drug three times a day and so I discontinued use.	There were no side effects -- but the expected effects were very intense -- a hot flush that moved from my face to my legs, and itching on my arms, legs, back, and torso.	Niacin taken in such a large dose opens the capillaries. This increases the blood flow close to the skin and releases histamines. The resulting hot flush and itching lasts for about 15 minutes.  It is an interesting experience, but three times a day is a bit much, especially during my at work dose. The red face was alarming my customers and the itching was a bit too distracting.
666	erythromycin	3	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	possible pertusis	It did clear up the infection even in the time frame I used it.	I had severe stomach cramps and rapid heart beat.  Seemed to make me feel very thirsty and somewhat faint feeling.  Did not feel well at all.  My coughing and infection dramatically subsided, however, the side effects made me feel so badly I quit taking it.	This was prescribed to me for possible whooping cough...due to exposure to Pertusis through my daughter.  Even though my older daughter had received the Pertusis vaccine she still was finally diagnosed as having whooping cough.  It took several doctors to finally catch what she had.  In the meantime she was very sick...had several z-packs and failed to respond.  I came down with a bad cold shortly thereafter and as a precaution I was given the Erythromycin [different doctor than the one she went to].
1449	cymbalta	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	increased ability to cope	extremely bad stomach burning	support during life stress
4097	chantix	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	smoking cessation	This drug blocked the receptors for nicotine, so the cravings were extremely diminished. The dosage was increased over a week, so the physical withdrawal symptoms were decreased slowly.	The worst side effect was nausea.  When I reached the twice daily dose, I was nauseated most of the day. It was much better when I cut the pills in half and took them several times a day with plenty of liquid and food.  The other side effect is constipation. A low dose of a laxitive is helpful with this.	"I have quit smoking many times.  This time with Chantix has been the smoothest. 
The physical withdrawal was easier than times in the past.  I was somewhat irritable for a few days, but nothing severe.  The nausea and constipation were annoying, but I was able to work around them. The mental obsession of this addiction is still present at times, but no pill is going to make that go away. It has gotten easier with time."
923	paxil	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	ptsd, anxiety, depprssion, obsessive remembering	greatly helps depression and mood. Very effective for obsessive thinking/ fear.   Stopped depression and there are very few anxieties.  Regained appetite.	all emotions dulled, sexual numbness, flatulance, weight gain of 20% over normal weight, fatigue, loss of motivation and a bit scattered thinking.

Now taking 10 mg every other day for past 6 wks.  Starting to feel more alive and less sexual side effects.
1450	cymbalta	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	peripheral neuropathy	I suffered chronic pain and sleep disruption because of the PN of unknown cause (not diabetes).  I also suffered mild depression because of the chronic pain.  Cymbalta began to relieve my symptoms almost immediately (and the depression as well.)  I still have pain,sometimes better,sometimes worse, but this drug in combination with others (see above) as well as consistent exercise has helped tremendously.	The gabapentin, which I was taking long before cymbalta, made me sleepy, but on the day after a night of disrupted sleep, the fatique can be overwhelming.  Also, for the first six months or so, I had a lot of gas and stomach rumblings.  When I first started on cymbalta, I felt very spacey and light-headed but that passed after a couple of weeks.  My internist thinks my blood pressure is up slightly because of the cymbalta	I take cymbalta in combination with 2800 mg gabapentin and 25 mg elavil.
3398	proscar	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	alopecia	Reduction in Alopecia progression which began at age 21. Alopecia was very agressive through 20s until procecia introduction. Since then the condition has been slowed although not stopped.	Testicular discomfort at onset with a decrease in semen production. No other noticeable effects worth noting.	Taken orally once a day. Usually at night.
3210	benicar	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	The treatment benefits are to help lower blood pressure.  Blood pressure is being monitored by the physician and the patient.  So far, the benicar has shown to be as beneficial as the previous medicine patient has been on for the last seven years.  Since the pill is considerably larger than previous medicine I was on, I do have to chew the pill.	I have not noticed any side effects so far.  I have been taking the medicine about one month.  I plan to visit the doctor in eight weeks again at which time I am sure the doctor will check my blood for any changes that may have occurred.  But so far, nothing has been noticed.	I have been on blood pressure medication for about seven years now.  Each doctor that I went to has changed my medication several times.  My blood pressure has been lower since visiting a nephrologist.  Recently I went to a regular general practitioner and she changed my medicine once again to the Benicar.  It seems to be helping somewhat with very few, if any, sign effects.
2977	strattera	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	add	Treatment benefits include improved attention to task, improvement in work quality and quantity. Impulsivity was greatly reduced, resulting in a calmer more productive day. Social relationships with co-workers and others were markedly improved. Social relationships with extended family members were also improved. As a result there was a marked improvement in self esteem and confidence levels both at work and at home.	There wer few side effects.  I experienced intermittent episodes of dry mouth that interferes when during public speaking, speaking at meetings and in social situations.  This can be resolved with small candies, however, that resulted in tooth decay.  I am currently trying out a gel and mouthwash given to me by my dentist, however, I am not happy about putting these chemicals in my mouth.	I am not sure what you want in this section.  I received counseling.  Medication was suggested.  Other more typical, stimulant  medications were tried but produced anxiety.  This is a newer non-stimulant medication, and that is a plus. I have continued counseling and periodic check-ups with the prescribing physician.  I am pleased with the results and plan on continuing with this treatment.
2266	lexapro	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	major depression	Lexapro has proven to be a very effective antidepressant that is entirely lacking in sexual side-effects.	Lexapro is quite stimulating, which I consider to be a good thing, but I do consider the feeling of being a little too euphoric a side effect of the drug.	"I have suffered from dysthymia (low mood) with major depressive episodes for most of my adult life.  The newer antidepressants, particularly Prozac and Effexor, were lifesavers for me and I expect to be on a daily antidepressant for life.  Antidepressants such as Prozac and Lexapro, however, greatly depressed my sexual desire and ability to reach climax (adversely affecting my relationship with my husband).  These medications also ""pooped out"" (stopped working) after a while, and even when they were working, they would not entirely relieve my low mood.  Ever since my psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro several years ago, my mood issues have entirely disappeared with absolutely no adverse sexual side effects."
2389	synthroid	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypothyroid	Decreased TSH Level from 428 to 1.5  Loss of hair slowed. Memory and depression improved. Body temp increased from 96 to 97.8  Energy level improved drastically. I could finally get though the day without having to nap fequently(4/5 naps of at least 20 to 30 mins) Brain fog lifted. Muscle aches and pains deminished. Skin was not as dry.	I went from having daily bowel movments to only around three times weekly. I had to increase fluid intake and add fiber supplements.	I get my TSH Level checked every 6 months or sooner if I start feeling sluggish, lossing more hair. I sometimes need to increase or decrease the medication a bit. I take synthyroid daily 1 hour before eating and 4 hours prior to any calcium or iron.
812	ambien	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sleep deprivation	I had been having a pro-longed sleep deprivation problem, and was very fatigued and emotionally drained from it. I tried Tylenol PM but i read the negative effects on the liver from taking Tylenol frequently so I discontinued use. I finally went to the doctor to see what they might suggest, and after a consultation, i was prescribed Ambien. After trying it, I discovered that I would go out to sleep very deeply, and have vivid nightmares. I would wake up 3 to 4 hours later every night though, and only be able to go back to sleep very lightly. After a month of that, I gave it up. I ended up taking 5HTP for awhile with melatonin and now I sleep much better.	Nightmares, short sleep time	I was to take 1 nightly for 1 month to see if this helped my problem, then return to doctor for consultation.
1521	glucophage	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	diabetes	Once daily dose was more convenient than split doses of previous medication. The gradual release of the medication certainly reduced stomach and bowel problems (frequency and urgency of bowel movements) that had hampered activities beneficial to health such as hiking. The medication produced moderate control of my diabetes, though it is hard to judge what my blood sugar would have been without it	There is still some degree of bowel disturbance. however, the most concerning side effect (which is common to other (non time release) forms of metformin is impaired B12 and iron absorption. It took some time to identify this problem and I discovered it myself rather than being tested for it.	"Metformin was the treatment of choice for my diabetes as it does not produce weight gain. I take 4 time-release tablets after my evening meal. It is important to take the tablets with food to minimise digestive upsets.
On disconcerting feature is that the empty tablet cases pass through the body adn appear in the stools"
3267	zoloft	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression;	The benefits included mood elevation,obsessive thinking became less.  Anxiety and sleeping definately improved.	Major weight gain!!!!	I had to take 25mg. to start and increase from there up to 100 mg. per day.  I also had some therapy.  Homework.  I had to slowly put myself into situations that previously made me very anxious, this drug truly helped!!!  I really did hate the weight gain though.
2589	oxazepam	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	temporary anxiety	"My father was put on this drug to fend off temporary, situational anxiety when his wife developed alzheimer's and was not looking after the finances properly.  It helped him to sleep better.  In the meantime, our family helped them sort out the financial mess his wife had created in her confusion.  

His anxiety ended but the doctor forgot to take him off the drug at the end of the 4 month period of effectiveness."	After 5 years of taking this drug, my father has developed short term memory loss which has developed to the point he now has an alzheimer's diagnosis for himself.  He has no other symptoms of AD, just short term memory loss after 5 years on a drug that is only proven 'effective' for 4 months.	"Due to a recent mix up at the pharmacy, my father was accidentally withdrawn from the drug and suffered a terrible withdrawal.  After 10 days without oxazepam, his memory improved but the doctor put him right back on it.  I have since tried to get the doc to take him off.  His answer?  What's the point at his age.  Why not just let him drift away in a foggy twilight.  

I love my dad and think he deserves better so I'm fighting this situation, but meanwhile my father wakes up each day wondering why he is on an advanced alzheimer's ward when he has no symptoms beyond drug induced short term memory loss."

1814	humira	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis	"I was initially placed on this medication several years ago for RA when Vioxx was pulled.  I religiously self administered the medication for two years and then decided to quit because I didn't believe that it was helping much.  I took a ""holiday"" for 16 months and then checked in with my rheumatologist.  She suggested that I restart the medicine based upon x-rays and blood work.  I have been on it again for 3mos...I feel better...less pain..more energy."	I have not experienced any side effects.	I am fortunate that I have good insurance coverage because it is very expensive. As with any medicine...I am concerned about possible long term side effects.  However...my grandmother had RA and was severely crippled with the disease.  This medication is supposed to prevent joint destruction...I am hoping that it will.

3424	tazorac	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	adult onset acne	The drug cleared the acne.  In addition, it peeled away old skin at the site.  I used it over small wrinkles and skin lines (without doctor's knowledge).  I was pleased with the results over small skin lines.  These dissapeared or diminished.  The product does not work over face parenthesis or deep wrinkles.  It appeared to me that skin's tone also improved.  The skin also developed a healthy shine.	The side effects as reported are skin redness and sun sensitivity.  I experienced both.  Always use this product with a sun screen or you will burn 10X faster. The product should be used as directed and a little goes a long ways.  I used too much at the beggining (I also left on the product during the day) and my skin got really irritated and peeled.	The product was to be used at bedtime.  To leave on all night and wash in the morning.  The treatment was to continue until acne resolved then use as needed.
3061	oxycodone	3	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	pain management	"Initially the treatment benefits were
-increased mobility/ activity level due to experiencing less pain
- sleep ( was able to sleep longer while the medication was still active)
- better mood (because of less pain)"	The level of pain control quickly decreased (with the prescribed amount of medication(10 mg)) resulting in having to steadily increase the dosage for the same amount of pain relief. However the worst side effects were severe constipation(even while taking stool softeners/extra fiber, water, etc), depression, insomnia, weight loss, hair loss, muscle wasting, my skin became completely dehydrated and wrinkled. Became physically and mentally addicted to the medication, when I tried to reduce the dosage /stop taking the medication I experienced severe withdrawal symptoms (fever,chills, nausea, vomiting, severe bone muscle and joint pain) to name a few.	I was in an MVA in 2002 in which I suffered a whiplash type injury which caused/accelerated the DDD. I was prescribed Percocette 5mg on an as needed basis for pain control. After 3 years (of constant agonizing pain)of being on the Percocette they became ineffective at relieving pain and I was referred to a PAIN CLINIC specializing in chronic pain. The doctors there decided that I had built up a tolerance/dependence on the Percocette and that it would be best to put me on a longer acting narcotic (Oxycontin 10mg,time released, supposed to provide pain relief for 12 hrs) with Percocette (Oxycodone 5mg/Acetaminophen 325 mg)for break through pain. In the beginning the medication seemed to help but over time I built up a tolerance to the Oxycodone(they became less effective) which meant I had to keep increasing the dosage to get the same amount of pain relief. For example I started out with Oxycontin 10mg/3x day and approx 3 Percocette/daily a couple of months later as my tolerance increased I had to take Oxycontin 20mg/3X day and 5-6 Percocette as the months passed by my tolerance grew and my dosage was increased. After about 8 months on the Oxycontin I started to experience all of the side effects mentioned above, not only did I notice the negative effects the drug was having on me but friends and family noticed too, and mentioned (not to me but amongst themselves) that my appearance/demeanor over the past 2 yrs had dramatically changed. A couple of months ago my Sister took me aside and asked me what was wrong to which I replied nothing why? She then explained to me how my behavior(depression, moodiness, etc.) and appearance(drastic weight loss) had been getting worse and worse and told me that she was worried. Being under the influence of these drugs for so long I felt like I was in a fog and really had no idea as to the extent of how bad it really was/ how I looked. So I stepped back and examined the last 4-5 yrs of my life while on these medications and realized that they had taken a considerable toll on me emotionally, physically, mentally. I strongly advise that before anyone decides to go this route for pain management that you have a long talk with your Physician on the pros and cons of this medication specifically the Oxycontin. If I would have known then what I know now about all the negative side effects I would never, never had started taking it. I feel that it deteriorated my body (especially my muscle mass and skin). When I started taking the medication I was 37 and felt 25 and was told I looked like I was in my late 20's, I am now 42, I feel 50 and now in an effort to spare my feelings people don't mention anything about how old I look . I wish that my Physicians would have told me about ALL of the negative effects of this medication instead of just the positive (which are few). In my opinion the negative far outweigh the positive. I'm still in constant pain but will continue to search for pain management without drugs. PLEASE USE WITH CAUTION!
848	ritalin	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	add	While i take this drug, i feel very well, happy, I can concentrate in my activities. It helps me to make decisions, I can complete activities, i talk a lot, i stay in a good mood, but just while is during the effects.	My heart beats faster and i feel its not in a constant rhythm. My mouth is dry and I feel extremely anxious, and because of this, very clumsy.	My diagnostic of ADD was not really accurate. A did just some practical test but no brain exam. The doctor prescribe ritalin as a test, but because of the side effects I had to stop. I did psychotherapy during the treatment. The ritalin helped me but,of course, didn't stop my problems. I feel really better now, but i didn't find yet a drug to help instead of ritalin.

2943	mirapex	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	restless leg syndrome	Before I began taking the Mirapex, I was taking Clonapin which was very ineffective as I was constantly waking up in the middle of the night having to take more medication to get back to sleep. I had to get up and walk around until the medication took effect and I was exhausted all the time. On Mirapex,  I am able to sleep at night without being awakened by my restless legs which is a huge relief for me and my husband.	"I have what I call a window of opportunity to take Mirapex by 7PM or I will be very ""anxious"" and highly uncomfortable due to the restless legs jumping and distress. It causes me to go to sleep shortly after taking it, which makes going to a movie theater almost impossible in the evening as I will sleep through most of the movie if I've taken my medicine."	I take Mirapex at 7PM every night so that I will not feel the effects of the Restless Legs Syndrome and will fall asleep, sleeping through the night in my bed without having to get up and walk around. This is a big relief to me and enables me to sleep in the same bed as my husband whereas before, I had to get up out of bed and walk briskly around the house. Now I am rested and able to function the next day. I have been part of a study group for Restless Legs Syndrome and I was the only one whose doctor had put them on Mirapex... others were on Requip and experiencing significant amounts of stress. After hearing about my experience with Mirapex, they were going to ask their doctors about it.
1625	premarin	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	memopause	"I believe that the Premearin allowed normal vaginal secretions and
somewhat emotional stability.  During the time I was using the Premarin I had
decreased hot flashes/sweats that, I presumed was a result of the drug, although the hot flashes are much more infrequent now that I'm using the natural progesterone cream."	While using the Premarin pills for Hormonal Replacement Therapy I was also taking Progestin so am unsure as to which drug was causing my very painfully tender breasts with increased fibrocystic breast disease noted on my annual momograms. I suspect that these drugs were also contributing to the blood sugar issues and low throid.	I chose to discontinue the HRT completely after I developed a painful mastitis in my lt breast, and 6months later a mamogram showed a suspicious spot that was removed and biopsied. It was benign. Since stopping the Premarin and switching to a natural progesterone cream that I use vaginally I no longer have painful fibrocystic breasts and the hypoglycemia and hypothyroid have been healed thru prayer.

My muscles, joints & bones ached. The depression was not relieved, which probably a result of the side effects. I came off the drug slowly ( with help of physician) and now I feel great. The depression is still a possibility but I will NEVER take an anti-depression drug again.  I choose to have therapy and ask for the support of my family & friends	Slowly declined dosage and am NOW EFFEXOR XR FREE!!!!!!!
131	valtrex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	herpes cold sores around mouth and nose	When I feel or see the signs of a cold sore coming, I take the valtrex and it is gone without a trace within 24 hours.	none	You need to take the valtrex immediately after feeling the start of a sore for maximum effectiveness.

I have been using the 200/6 turbohaler most of the time in the past 2 years consistently 2xtwice daily until recently when I have noticed  some loss of flexibility in my back and worsening indigestion (plus nervousness at using steroids); so I have been taking note of an information ""wheel"" from the nurse which basically tells me I can reduce dosage eventually to 1xonce a day if I am showing no symptoms. At the moment I am on 1xtwice daily which feels about right.  Will ask nurse about 100/6 (which has half the steroid content) on next visit.  Would like to come off completely but maybe not possible."
2537	lamisil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	fungal toenails	Clearup of infection and regrowth of nails	Basically none, but the doctor warned of possible liver damage, and suggested liver function checked before commencement.	After failure of several topical treatment, this medicine was the only choice offered.  Regrowth of 1/4 great toenail was observed after 4 weeks.

1620	premarin	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	hot flashes / night sweats	The Premarin did reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes and night sweats.  From that perspective, the drug was somewhat effective.  However, the side effects were devastating and worse than dealing with the menopausal symptoms.  It took me two years to discern that the problems I encountered were attributable directly to the Premarin.	I developed strange lesions on my arms, which were sore and very embarrassing.  I could not wear short-sleeved shirts, because of the mess my arms had become.  Obviously, I showed them to the doctor; he simply shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't have a clue what might be causing the lesions.  When I went off the Premarin, on my own volition, the lesions disappeared to a significant degree.  When I added proteolytic enzymes and hydrochloric acid to my diet, the lesions disappeared completely.  I am now able to use bioidentical hormone replacement therapy with complete success and no side effects whatsoever.	"The doctor put me on the maximum dosage because I was ""young"" for menopause.  Did not test estrogen levels either before beginning treatment or after starting the HRT.  I simply took one Premarin pill per day, every day."
857	valium	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety, panic disorder	I was given valium to calm me down as I couldn't take anti depressants as they gave me really severe side effects.  I found that the valium quietened my mind and slowed my body down without making me feel heavy or drugged.  It helped me cope with the stresses of every day life but also the stresses caused by my anxiety and panic disorder.  I think that is has a bad reputation possibly because people abuse it but taken as prescribed I find this drug incredibly useful and invaluable in helping me cope with things I wouldn't normally be able to do or cope with.  I get a warm feeling as it goes into my blood all the way down to my toes. I feel relaxed and happy and don't have any side effects whatsoever.  However it does make me feel a little sleepy for about half an hour after it starts working...which is actually a nice feeling when you're nervous and then I just feel relaxed.	I didn't have any side effects at all.  But it does make me sleepy for a little while in higher doses when it first starts working (YES, I can actually feel when it starts)	"I started having panic attacks in different places until my world became very restricted.  A doctor prescribed Valium and it helped.  I have still got worse over the years but valium still helps me cope with things like that I wouldn't normally be able to do at all, like shopping, going to the dentist, or out in public.  I feel valium has had a very bad write up...mainly I feel through abuse.  I've taken it most of my life and never took more than I was told to.  In fact I was so afraid it would ""stop"" working that I only took it when absolutely necessary.  This means that although I have taken it most of my life in larger or smaller doses, it still works for me and gets me though the hard times.  I don't think I have ever tried a drug that has helped me cope as well as this one has.  I hope it never gets taken off the market.  I currently take half a 5 mg tab when I have to do something I consider difficult, only taking the other half after assessing if one half is enough.  I hardly ever take more than one in a day and hardly ever more than two tabs in a week....sometimes a month.  Depending on my commitments."
448	lorazepam	5	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	The benefits were to relieve anxiety and to calm me down so I don't lose control and freak myself out. Also to control my heart palpatations when I become nervous.	the side effects were dizziness and light headaches, and stomach upset also.	I am not having any of the symptoms as much as when I first started to take the medication. I do still get the stomach upset if I don't eat a nutrious meal if I eat too much greasy or over prcessed foods it seems to bother my stoch than if i eat veggies and baked foods or boiled.
3753	spironolactone	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acne	The once daily treatment was effective in keeping me from having moderate acne breakouts while I was taking hormone replacement therapy.  I also used testosterone cream (compounded) and my doctor felt that this was the source of the acne and also some water retention.	I don't believe I experienced any side effects at all and have always been very satisfied with the the medication.  I have only recently begun to look at other kinds of hormone replacement therapy that is all compounded and natural based.	I have taken 1 50mg tablet daily for over 6 years for treatment of acne...caused by hormone replacement medications including testosterone cream.  The medication worked very well for me for as long as I was taking it.
3831	lumigan	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	cosmetic longer lashes	I got longer, darker and thicker eyelashes. These were noticeable after about 6 weeks. Thereafter they continued to grow for a few months till they reached a maximum. Then I carried on with maintenance doses.	Just the itchy eyelids. Other than that there was occasioanlly a very slight burning.	I painted a small amount of Lumigan on the upper and lower lashline every night for a week and then every other night thereafter. For this I used a small brush and a tiny little line.
3849	voltaren	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	arthritis in knees	diminished inflammation, noticeable loss of swelling, pain relief, did not have to take it orally-I applied it as needed on affected knee. It has worked on other joints too (hands, hips, etc..)	dry skin, numbness at application site, strong smell, the smell disappears quickly, and I treat the dryness with moisturizer. The numbness goes away or is less noticeable with time.	I applied the gel as directed on box label. Larger amounts are needed on large joints (knees, hips); dosage is smaller on smaller joints (hands). I used the application strips provided with gel to measure dose, and washed my hands thoroughly after application. Within 20 minutes I felt better.
3402	proscar	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hair loss	I have experienced an very noticable decrease in hairloss or progression of male pattern baldness after I started using this product.  It was advised to me by a physician friend.  It's basicaly the same product as Propesia which are being sold as an chosmetic product at half the dosage and for double the price.  I have noticed a severe reduction in hairloss and have actualy grown some hair back.	I was told by my physician friend that the product was completely safe to take and that I should not experience any side effects.  I have to admit that I have not experienced any side effects on this product at this dosage at all.	The dosage is suppose to be 1mg/day as this is all that's needed by the body.  As proscar only comes in 5mg tablets, I broke them in half and therefor took 2.5 mg's per day.  Propesia are however sold in 1mg tablets, but as mentioned before, are the exact same product and cost more than double the price as it's being marketed as an cosmetic product.

103	celebrex	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	arthritis	I have already given this information.xxxxxx The term arthritis means �joint inflammation.� Some people refer to arthritis as �joint pain.� There are more than 100 different types of arthritis. The 2 most common forms of arthritis are osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).	"I have already given this information.xxxxxxxx Osteoarthritis 
Osteoarthritis begins with the breakdown of joint cartilage, resulting in pain and stiffness. OA commonly affects the joints of the fingers, knees, hips, and spine. Other joints affected less frequently include the wrists, elbows, shoulders, and ankles. OA can also be caused by work-related repetitive injury and physical trauma."	"I have already given this information.xxxxxxxx  Rheumatoid arthritis 
Rheumatoid Arthritis causes inflammation of the joint lining, called the synovium. This type of arthritis can cause pain, stiffness, swelling, warmth, and redness. The affected joint may also lose its shape, resulting in loss of normal movement. RA can affect other parts of the body as well, including the blood, the lungs, and the heart. Rheumatoid Arthritis is 2 to 3 times more common in women than in men, and generally affects people between the ages of 20 and 50. However, young children can develop a form of RA called juvenile RA."

No adverse side effects.	After reading the blogs, it's certain that we are all very different in our responses to treatment.  I had failed all the standard treatments, including high oral doses of prednisone.  I was facing a life on a ventilator with a tube in my throat.  Within a few days of starting this medication, I could breath. Actually breath.  You who have had severe asthma know how wonderful air can be. Within a week, I went for a walk.  Hadn't been able to for almost a year. No depression. Actually, I feel pretty darned happy.

I lost weight because most of the time I was no longer depresses. and My overall health improved	For the first 6 months profuse se sweating and insomia.	I took 150mg of effexor daily. For 9 years I was able to live a normal life with some small episodes of mild depression now and then. The last 12 months the effect seems to be getting less and the depression is rearing its ugly head again and I am isolating myself and have to really try to fight depression. I am experiencing the well known  pooping out syndrome.I feel it is time tolook for another anti depressant which I am dreading.
1832	yasmin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	birth control	Yasmin is an excellent birth control pill.  Not only does it prevent pregnancy, but it decreases bloating, irritability, and monthly blood lost.  There is decreased break through bleeding and cramps as well.

I had a hard time, going straight to sleep at night.  I generally stayed awake about 2 hours later than I normally did.  But in the morning I wasn't overly tired, and as soon as I took the next pill within 30 minutes I had no desire to go back to sleep.  Also sometimes I would have a funny taste in my mouth."	Well their wasn't much treatment details.  You take the pill first thing in the morning and drink a glass of water with it.  It is an appetite suppressant.   It also gave me more energy as well, giving me more incentive to exercise, work around my house, etc....
165	zomig	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraines	The headaches are well controlled on this drug, sometimes for as long as 72 hours. However, the effects of the rug were shorter lived during hormonal migraines	The drug administration usually results in nausea and fatigue. Difficulty concentrating is also obseved	A single pill is to be taken at migraine onset. A second dose can be administered after two hours although in my opinion if the first dose failed the second will probably not help much.
3600	fluconazole	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	systemic fungus	lessening of fungus	inflamed liver, upset stomach	I was to take 400 mg daily, but could not handle that. After letting the drug dissipate out of my system, I resumed it at very low doses (25-125 mg daily) plus herbal and homeopathic remedies. This finally, after several months, got rid of the fungus.
911	paxil	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression, social anxiety disorder	For the first two weeks I did not feel absolutely anything. Then, after about 15 days, I began to feel different. My constant sense of fear and worry was replaced by a sudden feeling of self-confidence. My depression, which formerly kept me in a state of perpetual sorrow, self-pity and doubt, was lifted from me like a veil. Suddenly I was talkative and social, where before I was soft-spoken and hesitant. I behaved as if I could not fail in anything I undertook to do. I was asking women on dates with a directness and boldness that almost scared women away. You could say that while I was taking Paxil I was in a hypermanic state. The benefits were very real. I loved the miraculous effects of this medication. Unfortunately I was forced to stop taking Paxil because of negative side effects.	Decreased libido, insomnia, dry mouth, increased appetite	"I was not able to have sex because Paxil left me sexually numb. It was difficult to maintain an erection. When I did get an erection it was without any sexual pleasure, in other words, it was just a mechanical erection.
I could not sleep no matter how tired I became during the day. I had constant energy that would not go away even when I wanted to sleep. The insomnia was so bad that even sleeping pills could not counteract Paxil.
Dry mouth was mild to moderate, but nonetheless bothersome.
I gained a tremendous amount of weight in a short time. I went from 171lbs. to 227lbs. in about 4 months. Paxil gave me a huge appetite. I simply could not stop thinking about food, particularly sweets."
2676	prinivil	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hypertension	the low dosage of Lisinopril reduced my blood pressure from 138/96 to 127/90.	"Soon after starting treatment I developed moderate tinnitus, (ringing in the ears) in both ears but the ringing is more severe in the left ear.
I also have dry mouth and dry throat with a slight cough and minor throat discomfort."	I take 1 tablet per day, first thing in the morning.
2410	synthroid	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	Having been diagnosed with hypothyroidism when I was only twenty, I was administered varying levels of Synthroid.  Prior to taking the medication, my hypothyroid condition was so severe that my metabolism was adversely affected.  Not only did I feel sluggish, but my liver was even slow to act because I started turning orange! My fingertips were calloused, my speech was slurred and my hair had begun falling out.  When the first dosage was given, it was too high.  Then when it was adjusted and my blood levels determined that it was the right amount, the symptoms all began to subside and slowly I became functional again.  I don't normally take any over-the-counter medications but as for this prescription medication, I need it to effectively manage my hypothyroidism.	Initially, when the dosage given to me was too high, I became a little jittery.  If the doctor prescribes the right dosage for you, there should be minimal to no side effects at all.	Synthroid (generic name: Levoxyl) is taken once a day, preferably in the morning on an empty stomach.  There do not seem to be any extra details concerned with the daily administration of the drug.
3525	lunesta	1	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	None	Bad Taste but not as bad a most people say	Took 2mg for the first time ever (first ever sleep med) on an empty stomach and went to bed at 9:30 Got up at 11:30 and am typing this.

Severe vomiting and diarrohea.  Bad nightmares.  Decided this was going to spoil my holiday, as I could not eat having extreme nausea.	Stopped taking Malarone whilst still on holiday.
2568	klonopin	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	Treatment provided the patient with the ability to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep through the entire night	The patient noticed a grogginess in the morning that subsided after approx 10 minutes.	Patient was instructed to take .5 mg one hour before bedtime.  This was followed during the week nights and was immediately effectively.
1752	topamax	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine headaches	I was suffering from migraine headaches for more than 40 years, since a teenager. Topamax has reduced twice weekly migraine headaches to approx. 3 or 4 times a year for severe migraines, although I still suffer from chronic, but infinitely much easier to bear, daily headache. I am thankful for the use of this (originally) anti-seizure drug for migraine prevention.	Mild loss of appetite. Loss of interest in alcoholic beverages.	For the past six years of treatment, via a neurologist, I have been adjusting the medication from 400mg to 600 mg per day, to the current dosage of 400mg per day, in a divided dose. One tablet am, one tablet pm. I would recommend Topamax to anyone suffering with chronic migraine as the primary drug treatment, with additional rx with triptan meds.
2512	motrin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	arthritis pain, neck injury	decreased pain and inflamation, need no other pain medication for arthritis pain, have bee taking motrin for eight years with good results and little side effects other than mild nausea when taken without food.	motrin has caused mild nausea when taken without food and or milk. when taken after meals it did not cause any nausea, i have not noticed any other side effect.	take motrin 800mg, 1 three times a day as needed for arthritis pain
395	relpax	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine headaches	The medication helped to reduce the headache pain if not eliminate it completely.  I was getting a headache almost dailey. It was affecting my job and family life. My migraine would start with a mild headache on the left side of my face and the pain would increase with time. Taking Relpax at the onset really helped to slow down the pain and in most cases stop it.	The side effects were mild compared to the pain. Around 30 minutes after taking the pill, I would feel a little tired and sleepy.  However the feeling would not be so severe that I could not work or continue daily tasks.  This side effect would pass in about 1-2 hours.	At the onset of the headache, I would take a pill.  Some of my headaches would start at night, around 3:00AM and I would lay in bed hoping the pain would go away.  WRONG decision.  I quickly learned to take the pill as soon as I felt ANY sign of a headache, no matter what time of day or night.  If you don't take the pill at the onset of a headache, the pill will not be effective in stopping the pain and you will have to ride the headache out.  That could take a day to several days before the pain subsides.  It is extremely important to take this pill at the onset of a headache.
627	nortriptyline	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	shooting nerve-type pain in legs/fibromyalgia	the excruciating, shooting nerve pain in my left leg stopped after about a week although I could still feel that the nortriptyline just masked the pain ie. In the past 6 months I have got down to 12.5 mg per day although a recurrence of the terrible shooting pain (after 2 years) had made me decide to try Gabapentin instead- my doc recommends this	Fuzziness of thinking/short term memory loss- although this might be due to my fibromyalgia. Sexual disfunction- ie inability to have a full orgasm- and after 2 years of this, thi sis one of the reasons why I am ready to change to Gabapentin- as recommended by my doc. Sleepiness etc goes away after the first few weeks although it took me a good 6 months to properly adapt to this drug	10mg at night for the first 6 months, then the pain came through again so I upped this to 25mg per day. Six months ago, I wasn;t aware of any pain behind the pain that I had been used to so, thinking I was maybe a bit better, I cut the intake down to 12.5 mg a day by cutting my 25mg tablet in half each night. this was fine until a week ago when the shocking shooting pain returned accompanied by pin-prick sensations on my face and on my limbs- I've not had thi sin 2 years. I intend to try gabapentin now, although some people have referred to it as the 'zombie drug'. My main reason for not upping the Nortrip back to 25mg, is that I want to see if I will be able to have an orgasm on the Gaba- although maybe this is a luxury- as anyone with nerve pain knows, sex is the last thing on your mind when you are in such pain. But who knows, maybe I will be able to be pain-free and get my libido back...!
699	accutane	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Completely cleared up mild to moderate acne on face, neck, shoulders, back, and arms and should continue to stay clear for some length of time.	Dry, chapped lips and dry, flaky skin especially after showers. Both were completely treatable with chapstick and good lotion. No serious side effects, and no alarming changes in liver function or triglycerides on blood tests. No depression as well.	I had slight to moderate acne that was just really annoying and was not fixed by any type of treatment, so I finally gave in and went on Accutane. After reading all the online horror stories I was scared out of my mind. However, I had a great experience on it. I took 80mg/day for 5 months and weigh 200 lbs (90 kgs) so it was about 1 mg/day/kg, which is a moderate to high dose I was told. My lips were pretty dry and cracked if I didn't put on chapstick all the time. I also had really dry skin if I didn't put lotion on my shoulders, arms, back, and face after showering. Everything else was 100% fine though. No nosebleeds, no depression, no hair loss, no unbearable side effects. These horror stories are overblown and rare, and tons of people have great results on it. My acne is gone 100% from all over my body and it is such a relief to not have to deal with it. On completion, my dermatologist told me he has prescribed it for 10 years and has never once had a case of depression and only 2 people have had bad blood tests. If you're tired of acne, give Accutane a shot. If the sides are too rough in your case then you can go off of it, but it's such a great drug if it works for you the way it did for me and many others like me.
951	diovan	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	Some of the treatment benefits were: lower blood pressure, less headaches, less fatigue	The first few weeks of treatment, I felt a little dizzy. After that phase, there were no treatment side effects.	The doctor asked me to take 80mg daily. He also asked me to lower my salt intake and exercise regularly.
765	flonase	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	allergies	Effective inrelieving runny or clogged nose due to allergies, stops itchy,swelling and watering eyes.	Only lasted for 8 hours max, I was given specific instructions not to use more than once a day, so I still had to rely on over-the-counter pills after the 8 hours were up.  Caused asthma in cold, dry weather and a very, very scratchy throat, as in physically having to scratch at my throat to relieve it.  Worsened a pre-existing eczema condition.	Used 2 pumps per nostril, once a day to relieve everyday allergies.
2755	xenical	3	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	over weight	i have been on xenical for a little over 2 weeks and i lost 2 lbs and gained it back,i do not have oily stools infact i have a hard time going to the bathroom now.the only benefit i can see so far with xenical for me is i try to watch what i eat.	i dont have any other then now i am constipated	n/a
2324	lexapro	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	general depression/perimenopause	Started taking this drug for two reasons - peri-menopausal symptoms (mood swings) and depression experienced after going through hurricane Katrina. After 2-3 weeks of starting, noticed my temperament was much more even and felt better able to cope with daily stress and stay motivated.	Fortunately, none for me. I know this type of drug can cause sexual side effects and weight gain, but I have had no issues here. The only thing I noticed was the very first week I took it I was a bit sleepy/groggy during the day, but this went away once I adjusted.	Started out with a very low dose, 5mg/day for the first month, then moved up to 10 mg/day which is my present dose. The full dose is actually 20mg/day, but I feel I am getting the results I need with 10mg, so there is no need to increase the dosage and risk any adverse side effects.
1392	mercaptopurine	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	crohn's disease	I was prescribed the drug Mercaptopurine after two previous treatment drugs had begun to prove less effective than before.  The doctor started on a higher course of the medicine, but the dose is currently 100mg (2 pills) every evening.  There was a significant reduction in Crohn's disease symptoms, particularly general intestinal cramping.  This was particularly helpful for cramping that tended to occur as I was relaxing to go to sleep.	Though the Crohn's disease in itself makes me tired, and I feel that the addition of the Mercaptopurine has added to my general fatigue.  The fatigue abated somewhat as the dose was lowered (the doctor started at a more aggressive dose).  I also seem to catch every bug that is going around.  By suppressing my immune system I believe the Mercaptopurine makes it easier for seasonal illnesses to set up shop.	I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease about eight years ago.  The doctor started with a series of Remicade and a prescription of Prednisone. This combination made it possible for me to eat again - hurray!  As for maintenance drugs, I have been on several, including Asacol and Pentasa.  There were probably others, but those are the two that I definitely remember.  It seemed as though my body would react well to a drug, but then the drug eventually lost that initial effectiveness. I have been on Mercaptopurine for 3-4 years now, and am getting ready to ask to move to a new drug. Mercaptopurine seems to be continuing to do a good job as a drug, but I'd like to find one that may be less deleterious to my liver.
2241	allegra	4	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	dust allergy	clear head - sometimes / less allergy - sometimes	Back pain, breathing problems, anxiety/hyperactivity, weight gain, tremors (like partkinsons), heart pounding, sleepiness and crying jags.	Took it for a year.  Never knew if it really helped. One year later I was literally crippled with side effects... now off it I'm back to my old self.  My allergies are the same as when I was on this med.  Huh.  I think different people react differently to medications.  I really do.
3620	retin-a	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acne	improved skin texture and tone	none. well sun sensitivity	take once every night, topical for two years
2910	tramadol	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	chronic leg pain due to trauma & surgeries	Significantly improved leg pain and allowed my child to use the leg and get stonger. Kept her from returning to narcotics. She was able to continue physical therapy and resume school. This site insists I write 50 words in this block, but I have covered all the relevant information. I just wanted people to know that once you adjust to this medicine it was a big help for my child's leg pain. I hope this is enough words.	Major initial side effects, but those improved significantly within a week. Stongly recommend increasing amount slowly and will probably need to wean off this drug. Initial side effects were headache, stomach discomfort, sensitivity to sound, etc. Again hang in there it was worthwhile for my child.	Has had many surgeries since an accident 3 years ago.
2847	singulair	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	chronic sinusitis	Reduces sinus congestion significantly. Made sleep easier.	Belly fat.	I asked the doctor about it, he said it had very low sides and worth trying and 30 minutes after taking it I felt like I took 30mg of sudaphed but without the hyperactivity. Ive noticed when taking together with sudaphed it reduces congestion even more. Also seems to reduce allergies but not to the same extent as antihistamines.
1411	adipex-p	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	weight loss	Considerable weight loss, increased energy, decreased appetite,	increased heart rate, jittery, hyperactivity, severe diet change	Taken to complement daily exercise and healthy eating, phentermine produced significant weight loss.  It was effective throughout the months, though it lessened over time. The heart rate issues and jitters were felt mostly during the beginning of the treatment.
648	seasonique	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pregnancy prevention	Very few side effects and no baby.  I started taking the pill because I wouldn't stop bleeding after having my daughter.  My doctor prescribed another type of pill and it stopped it immediately.  So after my next appointment, I told him I wanted something more permanent and seasonique was the answer.	breakthrough bleeding.  I took seasonique for nine months and had 20 days of breakthrough bleeding every three months.  It didn't matter if I took the pill everyday at the same time or took one later or even skipped one, it was always 20 days of breakthrough bleeding (at the least, 20 days).  The last straw was starting the end of July and still having breakthrough bleeding on my birthday at the end of August.  And to make matters worse, starting my period three days after it finally stopped!	Stopped taking the pill and asked for something else.
3900	dispermox	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	ear infection	It cleared the ear infection completely.  It offered me assurance that the infection did not progress to brain.	I did not experience any side affects.  I take Amoxicillin because it agrees with me.	I always take probiotics while I am taking antibiotics.  I also take the amoxicillin with food and water every time.
3608	retin-a	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	improvement of skin appearance/health	Improved appearance of skin (improvement of imperfections, reduced pore size, more even complexion, increased glow) and improved texture of skin (smoother and softer). Others have complimented me a lot on my appearance recently.	Dryness/peeling are the most frequent side effects for me, particularly with over application. Redness is less common and only occurs if I have really over applied the medication.	Retin-A .01% applied at night in a thin layer after cleansing to my face, ears, neck, and hands (applied every 3-4 days). Hydrocortisone 1% cream is used as needed to treat redness in case of over application.
4109	chantix	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	smoking	I quit smoking, minimized desire to drink alcohol, suppressed appetite, stabilized mood fluctuations.	I would get an upset stomach if I didn't eat at the time I took the medication.	Chantix somehow seems to suppress the pleasure part of the brain.  Before you realize it... you will have gone a whole day or maybe days/weeks without even thinking about a cigarette subconcsiously and when you do smoke a cigarette there is little to no euphoria or any other sensation for that matter, its just the taste of smoke and nicotine.  I also found it suppressed my appetite and my desire to drink, as well.
1893	doxycycline	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anti-malarial	I did not contract malaria and I also noticed some increase in the clarity of my skin.	No milk at time of medicine ingestion and very rare stomach upset. Additionally there was probably a slight increase in sun sensitivity but I was using a very powerful sunscreen so this was not a significant problem.	Taken before during and after travel to India. I starting taking it several days before leaving and took it daily while there and for 1 month after returning.
775	naproxen	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	rhuematoid arthritis	On the fist day I experienced symptoms such as shortness of breath but the drug seemed to take affect the next day. When I took the drug on the second day I expereinced an increased heartrate and other symptoms such as the ones I listed above.	on the first day I experienced symptoms such as shortness of breath. On the second day I expereinced an increased heartrate and other symptoms such chest pains, stomach ache, an intense irritability. In addition, upon stdying this drug and reading the symptoms I am more in fear for my health and my safety.	2 pills taken daily. Thank God I did not or I would be in the hospital.
3788	keflex	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	polinoidal cyst	"visible reduction in the infection was noted at approx 4 days.  It was a good alternative to having a surgical procedure and the required ""down time"" associated with a surgical procedure."	none	chronic condition - relatively good alternative to a surgical procedure.  Actually, was very afraid of the alternative surgical procedure due to the open wound remaining for a large amount of time and the negative feedback located on the internet associated with the surgical procedure.
51	clarinex	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergies and asthma	helped relieve the allegy symptoms for a part of the day	sleepiness	"while this product worked for a limited time, I have found another product that works 24/7.  This is an isotonic product (2 oz drink)that goes directly to the blood stream and among many other benefits dramatically reduces allergy symptoms.  http://www.marketamerica.com/topproducts-13009/isotonix-opc3.htm
I have no side effects from this treatment"
2612	adderall-xr	1	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	adhd	i cant list very many benefits because my expierience was so bad that i would rather have been dead than have been forced to have taken this pill every day for 3 to 4 years	i was severly depressed and had a lot of suicide attempts and i thought everyone hated me. i always wanted to be dead and nobody listened to me, they just upped the dosage and with the higher dosage the worse it got	it sucked. sure i didnt have ADHD but i also felt as though i lost my soul in the proccess. i became so depressed i actually began to feel like a shell
2554	ziana	3	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne / blackheads / oily skin	Ziana minimized the large sore pimples.  I continued to have a few during my menstrual cycle. However, I continued to experience blocked pores / blackheads and very oily skin.  The product did not appear to help this.	Ocassionally I would experience very mild flakey skin.  However, given my oily skin it was only noticeable right after I washed my face.	I would apply the Ziana once a day at night after washing my face with a mild cleanser.
2663	prinivil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hbp	After starting on a diuretic and a beta blocker without significant results, adding the ACE inhibitor worked wonders, and has continued to do so for 27 years. The next step, if one becomes necessary will be to add a sartan. Based on my previous response. I expect it to be a happy experience.	For no apparent reason the dosage needs to be adjusted, up or down from time to time. Fortunately hypertension is not asymptomatic in this patient: have a headache, it's up, raise the dose; feel wiped out, it's down, lower the dose. All this has been confirmed by home, office, and pharmacy readings.	"I never expected to live this long, let alone feel as healthy as I do. My mother died at age 53, and the last years of her life were marred by pain, discomfort and significant disability due to cardiovascular disease.

My experience is one more validation of the benefits of early and aggressive intervention in the case of mild hypertension."
2838	singulair	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	asthma/allergies	noticed a significant improvement in exercise induced asthma/shortness of breath. Also I previously had a chronic cough/throat irritation prior to taking singulair and this is now gone. My asthma would act up when I drink or eat cold foods and this is no longer a problem. I haven't had bronchitis in over a year and would usually get 3-4 x  year.	Did not notice any side effects. There are reports of depression as side effects but since I suffer from depression anyway it's hard to tell. Haven had any worsening of depression since starting singulair.	Singulair has been very beneficial in controlling my asthma and bronchitis. Do not notice it helps much with my allergies though. I do take zyrtec for allergies but if I run out and still taking the singulair my allerties come right back. When I miss a dose of singulair I notice my cough comes back right away.
3291	zoloft	7	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression/anxiety	"at initial dose of 25MG felt effects very quickly.  Titrated up to 100MG/day and slowly noticed it losing its ""punch"". Initially felt much better - motivation increased dramatically.  Finally felt normal, and in combination with Trazodone slept very well for the first time in years."	initial upset stomach and felt like a zombie...but it passed within a couple of days with each dose increase.  Crazy dreams.  MD decision to take off of zoloft was due to hair loss.	Always took dose in the AM with food.
1384	biaxin	3	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	ear and throat infection	It took at least 3 days of treatment for me to begin feeling better. On day 6, the ear and throat feel better.  However, I have tickling in my chest and lots of coughing that was not initially the problem.	"Excessive thirst and a disgusting taste in my mouth that is getting worse by the day.  I am pretty sure it's accompanied by a foul mouth odour, judging from the reactions I am getting while talking to people.  Even my Cat is smelling my breathe. strange. 

I also have not been able to sleep well at night;  causing me to have a very hard time getting up in the morning and feeling lethargic."	"2 pills once per day for ten days until finished.

1127	evista	5	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	loss of bone density	Since beginning treatment with Evista, I have had three DEXA scans, and my bone density has remained stable.  I have had no broken bones or spinal fractures during this period, and I have heighth has remained the same.	I have had infrequent, but painful, leg cramps in my thighs.	I take one 60mg pill daily which can be taken anytime of the day, with or without food.
3839	omacor	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	high cholesterol	lowered total cholesterol by 40 points	"continual belching of ""fishy"" taste"	"Both my husband & I have taken this medication.  His results have been more dramatic than mine.  He has seen a total cholesterol level lowering of 60 points to less than 200.  Mine has lowered to just above 200 at 215, which is the lowest I've seen.  There are minimal side effects.  Mostly a ""fishy"" taste for 2-4 hours after taking the medication.  Since I have difficulty digesting most vitamins, this is to be expected.  My husband has had no side effects with this medication what so ever.  It has the additional effect of lowering triglycerides.  While it is a prescription medication, it is concentrated Omega 3's & has proven the safest way for us to bring our high cholesterol to a manageable level after failing with diet & exercise."
1041	vyvanse	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	add	I went to therapy and asked about ADD meds, I took a test showing attention and memory lapses. Doc gave me 60 mg, my grades improved dramatically, which was specifically the result I wanted. Furthermore, I got far more done outside of school, coincidentally.	"Slow production(over-concentration?)
Heart palpitations (occasional, esp with caffeine)
Pharmacy information says ""may be habit forming"" and ""not recommended for people with a history of drug abuse."" If alcohol and tobacco habits are considered ""drug abuse"", then smokers and drinkers (incl. coffee) may be more vulnerable to forming a habit.
Loss of appetite"	I returned to school mid-career when I saw the economy tanking. I was unable to grasp the rudiments (law, rigorous)despite many hours of studying and reading. During that time my father died, I was depressed and close to failing out. I went through therapy and asked about ADD meds. I took a test showing attention and memory lapses. Doc prescribed 60 mg. I could tell an immediate difference. My grades improved dramatically, which was specifically the result I wanted. I now take 70 mg and intend to until graduating and taking the big test in Oct. '11. After that, I hope to stop taking it. I am not certain that it is effective over 6 months. It seems that one might build up a tolerance to the effectiveness. This most recent semester, my memory seemed to be where it was before I started taking it, but I have not found out yet.
2464	aciphex	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	heart burn	After taking Aciphex for 1 week, my heartburn symptoms went completely away.	None	My heartburn is triggered by many foods, not just spicy ones, but the Aciphex keeps the burn away even when I do eat spicy food or drink red wine. My biggest issue is that it takes more than 2 0r 3 doses over the same amount of days to feel any relief, and as soon as you stop taking it - the burn is back. It's also pricy, even with insurance.
2299	lexapro	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	This drug was most effective in 'cooling' my anxiety.  The depression was less affected, but definately improved.  I felt much calmer and able to deal with my situation more effectively.  I wasn't panic striken anymore or weeping all the time.	At first the dose of 20mg left me a little zombie like.  I'd sit and stare out the window all day.  When the dose was reduced to 10mg. this side effect went away.  I also developed a clenched jaw, which sometimes I snapped and my teeth grinding became much worse.  I also developed ringing in my ears.  I also gained weight, a total of 25 pounds.	I was treated for anxiety and depression with this drug, beginning with 20mg and then reducing it to 10mg.  I was going through a divorse at the time and could not cope with the overwhelming crisis.  This drug was given in combination with cognitive psychotherapy and together I believe they were very effective.  I was able to be weaned off very easily after one and a half years and feel fine now.  The side affects were a bit troublesome and they remain; ie.  the teeth grinding and ringing in the ears and weight gain.
2158	zyrtec	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	water in ear	It did clear up my inner ear water. It also seemed to dry up the constant mucus that seemed to be in my sinuses. This helped me to be able to breathe better.	The only side effect that I could notice was dryness in my mouth and nostrils. I seemed to be thirsty all of the time. And my nose and sinuses seemed to be really dry.	I took 1 pill each day. I enjoyed not having to take it more than once per day. I have problems remembering to take more than one dose a day.
4086	mobic	3	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	bursitis	I did not notice any benefits in terms of decrease of pain or inflammation in the affected site.  I've found fish oil and curcumin to be far more effective with fewer side effects.	Personally, I noticed an increase in constipation as a result of taking this medication.  I also saw an increased incidence of heart burn during that period.	I was experiencing inflammation in my hip after surgery.  Mobic was prescribed to deal with the inflammation, but I didn't notice any strong positive effects.
3599	fluconazole	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	yeast infection	The single dose was easy to take, and the drug got rid of any other fungal infections in my body that may have contributed to the vaginal yeast infection.	I had extreme intestinal bloating and very painful gas for a few hours the evening after I took the drug.  These subsided, but my gut still was a bit upset after eating for the next day, and I didn't have a bowel movement for 48 hours.	One tablet taken orally one time to combat a vaginal yeast infection.
111	celebrex	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	crohn's/colitis	The medication does seem to help with joint inflammation.  I find no real benefit for headaches or body aches.  There are some studies that show this drug may be beneficial for the treatment of polyps in the large intestine which may be a benefit for me in the long run.	None that I am aware of though I am cautioned by my Doctors that the fact that I have been taking this drug for a long time even though my dosage is not the highest, that it may have an adverse effect on my heart.	"I take 2 100 mg pills a day.  As I said it does help with joint inflammation.  My attitude is, ""what is the alternative"".  Since I do not have an expiration date stamped on me, I will not know if this drug lengthened or shortened my life.  But it does help me today to lead what I think of as a more 'normal' life."
183	adderall	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	attention deficit disorder	My attention span was incrementally increased, as was the intensity of my focus. Also, while taking the drug, I noted a significant decrease in my appetite, which subsequently induced a fair amount of weight loss.	I experienced heightened levels of sleeplessness while on the medication. In addition, I was constantly concerned about my ability to study and perform while not on the medication. While this is not a physical side effect, it is a very real emotional one that caused me some stress.	After noticing that I was having difficulty being attentive during my high school classes, experiencing an inability to sustain focus on one thing at a time, and was unable to finish assignments on time due to these two symptoms, I decided to see my doctor. He asked me a variety of questions about my current state and the problems I was having, and after listening, prescribed a small dosage of Adderall to alleviate these issues. After taking the first dose, my concentration increased ten-fold. As a result, my grades went up. I discontinued my use of Adderall upon my college graduation, and have found that while I still suffer from symptoms of attention deficit disorder, it is having a decreased effect on my adult life.
2530	lamisil	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	fingernail fungus	My fingernails have grown back to where the nail hits the end of where it should be instead of clipped down. I cant wait for the nail to grow  back all the way to where I can pick up a piece of thin paper with my fingernail, as I work at an office!.Also, the little black splinters under my thumb nail are starting to go away, as is the yellowing and thickness of the nail, due to the infection.	A long time ago, 10 years, when I was prescribed lamisil by my doctor, I had dark circles under my eyes and was tired lots of time. When I went back to teh doctor he told me he had to take me off the lamisil because it was harming my liver function. But by that time, the effect of teh medicine was enough for my nails to grow back after that. I think it was a change in climate, moving away from Astoria to a dryer climate of Portland.	When I saw the doctor 10 or so years ago, My nails were so bad, it was hard to look at them. The nails were thin and undernieth there was the infection of pus, so much that I had to clip the nails down and even pull one off; which wasnt difficult, because it was so weak, it just came right off. But after I took the lamisil, they grew back better, eventually.
615	finacea	3	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	rosacea	DECREASED REDNESS	HIGHLY IRRITATED AND DRY SKIN	NONE
3188	desyrel	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	insomnia	There were few benefits.  It still took me a long time to go to sleep, about two hours.  Some nights it didn't work at all.  When dosage was increased the side effects became unacceptable.  I took the medication for a week and then could not stand it anymore.  It was preferable to go without sleep than to take this drug.	Dizziness, dry mouth, extremely dry skin, highly increased urination, memory problems.	I started with a half pill, then it was increased to 1 due to ineffectiveness.  It was increased to 1 1/2, then 2 pills.
3283	zoloft	1	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I had no benefits.  It didn't seem to make anything better at the time.  It seemed the depression was still the same and then I had side effects that affected me daily.	I suffered from daily Headaches and also  slight nausea every once in awhile. I also felt very dried out and thirsty.  It also affected me by lowering my  libido.	I was supposed to take a pill every morning with water.  I felt better once I stopped taking the pills and actually just started working on myself and my goals and then also wehn I started doing volunteer work to help children.
1717	retin-a-micro	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Less pimples, increased smoothness of skin	peeling; difficulty applying makeup due to the peeling; difficulty keeping the makeup looking acceptable during the day due to peeling; dryness on occasion; sensitivity mainly in the neck region; greater sensitivity to products such as foundation and many sunsceens - particularly those containing Helioplex	I applied the product at night along with a moisturizer recommended by my doctor.  While there was a decrease in blemishes, I still have several on any given day.  This is has not been a completely effective treatment on its own.
1568	lortab	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	oral surgery	considerably reduced pain, if i experienced any at all.	With two tablets, the main difference was moderate to severe drowsiness. With either dosage, I experienced vibrant dreams/nightmares and/or an elated/lightheaded feeling while awake. Constipation relieved with extra fiber.	In my experience with this medication, I've found it moderately addicting and should be taken with caution. I advise to take when in mild-moderate pain because that's what it's for, but hold off taking it every six hours (or as prescribed) if pain is not an issue.
4059	amoxil	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	heart murmur/dental procedures	Since no such infection (i.e. endocarditis) ever occured after a dental procedure, the logical conclusion is that it was successful as an antidotal/ antibacterial treatment against (i.e.) endocarditis. However, I've not been prescribed/taken it for three years, also with no post-procedural infections.	Sleeplessness, easily bruised, diarrhea: the latter condition remained for up to a year or so AFTER I ceased taking Amoxicillin as a antibacterial antidote. I've not been prescribed/taken it for three years and the symptoms ceased. It's my understanding that this high-dosage, antidotal (dental) protocol is longer recommended.	To the best of my recollection (its been a while), the dentist(s) prescribed the 'standard' 2 - 4 500 mg. tablets to be taken 1 hour BEFORE any invasive procedure and the same dosage directly AFTER the procedure: cleaning, extraction, etc.: varying with dentist or procedure. I followed that procedure.
1722	retin-a-micro	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	repair and prevent wrinkles	Retin A Micro has lessened any uneven skin pigmentation.  Retin A Micro has minimized the size of my pores.  Retin A Micro has minimized wrinkling in my skin.	Retin A Micro causes me to peel the second day after I use Retin A Micro in the evening.  Retin A Micro initially causes more noticible fine lines when used around the eyes but I am continuing to use around the eyes for 6 months to see if ultimately it improves this area.	I initially began using Retin A Micro all over my face and neck (avoiding eye area) every other night.  My skin is fair and a little sensitive and it has tolerated it very well.  Every other day I do get a slight peeling of my skin around my mouth, my chin and my nose.  This peeling can easily be removed by sloughing off the peeling skin.  The benefits of Retin A Micro are unlike any skin product you could buy over the counter, used in conjunction with an effective sunscreen.
1185	prozac	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Prozac helped in toning donwn my depression. Prozac was effective for the first 5 years then my depression slowly started to become worse. I then had to be placed on Wellbutrin for about 2 years, along with Prozac and yet my side effects from Prozac increassed to the point where I was taken off prozac.	The main treatment side effect began as increased depression and slight shaking in my fingers and hands. Over time the shaking turned into tremors which I could not control. Then I was placed on Wellbutrin with Prozac and finally weined off of Prozac and the tremors subsided.	I took Prozac once a day in the morning with my other medications. At first my depression was under control but after about 5 years the depression began to become more intense. I was then placed on Wellbutrin with Prozac and my depression soon was improving. However, I started noticing hand shakes which progressively got worse. So after 2 years of Prozac and Wellbutrin I was told to stop Prozac. Within 6 months the shaking/tremors subsided and my depression is now fine by taking only Wellbutrin (150 mg/day)

The drug makes one sweat.It can work as an appetite suppressant if you don't eat before you take it and plan snacks throughout the day;allowing you to be appropriately hungry when it wears off.	"I think that you can use a drug like this as an adult and greatly benefit IF you retrain yourself behaviorally at the same time. The drug does not hold the key to your success, you do. It helps you if you work ""with it"" and relearn patterns and behaviors. examples are: time management and actually becoming AWARE of time for the first time in my life. I always wear a watch now and use alarms.I make lists,I plan short term and long term .
It allowed me to develop some control over myself and my life; life no longer just ""happens"" to me. I am present."
2545	lopressor	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	high blood pressure	It did lower my blood presure, but the 25mg dose that I was taking was too strong for me.	I was extremely tired, dizziness, slight headaches, and developed shortness of breath from time to time, aching extremities.	25mg once a day, then 12.5, and now 6.5 until im off. I'm hoping that I can start a natural approach to lowering my BP, because this medicine has made cmy health worse
397	relpax	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine	if taken within the first hour of of your personal migraine symtoms the med. works very well. usually within an hour you can control the nausea and light sensitivity with only a little sleepiness.it only takes about 30 to 60 minutes to take effect so if you catch it early you can forego almost all your pain.	the main side effects for me are sleepiness and moodiness. the sleepiness can be good if you have time to rest for a couple of hours..if not... it can be a little difficult to navigate through the day. the moodiness for me may simply be my depression over having another migraine...i am always hoping my last migraine was my last.	take one tablet on the onset of headache..usually if i take it within the first 30 min. i can control the nausea that accompanies the migraine...if i wait too long the med. doesn't work very well. also the ins. company limits me to 8 pills a month so if have to be very dilligent about taking the med. right away or i will have to take a second one a few hours later....they are too precious to use that much
1299	zocor	3	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	high cholesterol	I was originally prescribed 20 mg, but the rating was creeping up again, so the dosage was doubled. As I only took it for 2 weeks, cannot be sure of effectiveness	About 2 days after starting the course I began to get muscle pains. I had had these pains before (months ago) but the drug seemed to amplify them. The sites were a) in the groin area b) in the heel area, probably the achilles tendon	I told the doctor of the problems, and he immediately changed me over to atorvastatin, 20mg, and the pains have disappeared.

It is a hormone blocker that stops the production of estrogen.  Many breast cancer tumors are estrogen positive and thrive in the presence of estrogen.

I felt some dizziness and fatigue, but there were no clear side effects that were directly attributable to the drug.	After beginning treatment, I saw improvement within 2 days, and the urinary tract infection cleared up within 3-4 days.  I continued for another couple days to make sure it was gone for good.
3624	retin-a	7	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	fine lines around eyes and mouth. between the brow	Helped with condition of skin around the eyes, mouth and between the eyes. They did appear less noticable. The brown spots were greatly improved, lighter, less noticable	Slight redness for the first couple days. Very small amount of peeling or skin loosening.

Consequently I got a better quality of life.	I have not detected any side effects but the analysis I take every six months show that the amount of white blood except for a very low decrease of white cells and anemia.	I take one pill on breakfast, one on lunch and another one on dinner.
1754	topamax	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	migraine	Ive only been on Topamax for two weeks and only have had 1 migraine which is good for me. I use to have about 3 to 4 migraines in a matter of two weeks.	I literally feel stupud, I talk in circles and I go to college so it hasen't been easy in my classes when my professors call on me. I can't remember the stupidest things or I don't like to go out with my friends anymore cause I don't like to drink alchol anymore. I also get tingles in my toes, fingers, and sometimes feel like I have a peice of hair underneith my nose when it's just a tingles in my face.

Also switching over from elivil to topamax is veryyyyyyyyyyy painfullll i do always have a constant headache and i'm just waiting for that side affect to go away.	The first week I took I lowered my elivil to 20Mg and started my Topamax and had that at 50Mg for the first week. The second week lower the elivil to 10mg and up the topamax to 100 mg tehn the third week stop the elivil and continue the topamax at 100mg.
2149	zyrtec	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergies	Fewer allergies and sinus headaches.	Possible weight gain.	Drug taken for allergies and sinus problems.  It helped to alleviate sinus pain.
2098	renova	3	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	aging skin, wrinkles, sag	Hoping that contuined use will imporve my age spots and skin firmness.	Tight feeling of my facial skin. Drier skin than normal requiring more applications of moisturizer.	I wash my face with a sulfate free cleanser and rinse.

3371	lipitor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high cholesterol	Overall cholesterol dropped from 270 to 180. HDL went up, LDL went down to optimal ratios. My cholesterol numbers changed very quickly, within little over a month. Obviously, it's a very effective drug for me.	No detectable side effects. I hope that there are no long-term liver problems due to this drug, and at this time, there are no indications of any problems in this area.	"One 10 mg pill, 1x per day. 

I also received a blood test for liver abnormality at one month, three months, and one year, after beginning treatment. I now receive a blood test for liver abnormalities every 1 1/2 to 2 years, along with the rest of my regular bloodwork at normal checkups. So far, there have been no indications of any problems.

I'm also taking 200 mg per day of co q10 to replace what the Liptor diminishes. I do wish that my physician had mentioned this to me when he prescribed the Lipitor, but I actually found out about co q10 and lipitor through reading Dr Oz and Rizen's book ""You, Staying Young"". Upon asking my doctor about the co q10, he was familiar with it in relation to Lipitor usage, but never brought it up on his own. I realize that I would have continued taking Lipitor without any co q10 addition if I hadn't stumbled upon those facts by accident myself, and wish that when a physician prescribes a medication that they would also suggest any other supplements that should be taken or avoided along with the prescription.

Overall, this drug has been very successful for me. As I understand it, most people have to take a much higher dose than i do to obtain similar benefits, so I'm fortunate in this area, as I don't like to take much medication."
3141	ortho-novum	7	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	The only treatmenet benefits were the prevention of pregnancy and the near elimination of a monthly menstrual cycle --including the elimination of painful cramping during the monthly cyle.  The benefits at the time I was taking this medication outweighed the risks/side effects, but now the risks/side effects outweigh the benefits.	The main side effect was moodiness/mood swings.  I did not notice this so much while taking the medication.  I noticed the moodiness/mood swings more after being off of the medication for an extended period of time.  After being off of the medication I noticed a more stabe, hightened mood.	The treatment continued off and on for approximately 10 years.  During this time, I did go off of the medication for short intervals just due to the lack of necessity for the drug.  The medication was taken on a daily basis, and was effective.  Now, however, for me--the health risks involved in taking the drug (risk of heart attack, stroke, blood clots) far outweigh the benefits (I am a non smoker).  In addition, the mood factor also played a part in not returning to taking this drug.
573	lithium-carbonate	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	mania	prevented mania and panic experienced with mania	severe acne for first three years.	After the initial three years, this drug has worked well for me ever since.
4159	fioricet	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	chronic tension headache	Very good pain relief and muscle relaxation.  Great for alleviating pain from an especially bad headache but also works good as an adjunct for musculoskeletal pain.	Sedation, dizziness, very mild euphoria, intoxicated feeling (slurred speech, ataxia) at higher or repeated doses.  Addiction risk.	"Good at knocking down a particularly bad headache or other breakthrough pain.  Works better when taken at first sign of pain.  Butalbital and caffeine can cancel each other's sedating and stimulating effects, but a tolerance to caffeine will negate that.  Even so caffeine helps boost the effectiveness of acetaminophen.
Tolerance to butalbital's intoxication effects happen quickly but it can still be sedating.  Driving and other functions are impaired; if I have to take fioricet it's typically in the evening and then I'm done for the day."
3817	nolvadex	10	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	breast cancer	The objective of Tamoxifen is to work against the effects of estrogen on cancer cells. As a treatment for breast cancer, the drug is supposed to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells that are present in the body. I am praying that this is fulfilling its purpose but only in 3rd month of taking it so who knows.	"Main side effect : vaginal discharge, slight weight gain (water retention I hope)
and heartburn."	I have to take Tamoxifen for 5 years.
3232	nuvaring	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	Ability to have benefits of birth control in the convenience of a ring, that allows freedom from worrying about taking a pill and an unwanted pregnancy.	My first week with the ring I experienced extreme nausea, upset stomach and a tremendous decrease in appetite.  These symptoms slowly faded as the weeks passed.  Now the only side effects I notice are a less than normal appetite and occasional vaginal irritation, but nothing to painful or bothersome that I feel the need to seek medical treatment.	I'm married, I have both a full & part time job and I'm enrolled 15 hrs in school.  The ONE LESS STRESS of NOT having to worry about birth control let's me focus on what's important right now.  This is my method of choice and will be until I decide I'm ready for children.  Nuvaring is reliable... you can't really mess it up.  The fact that I don't have to worry about a little pill everyday makes my quality of life better.  I have the Nuvaring timer, which you can order from the website, that aids in reminding me that it's time, whether it be insertion or removal, and can be reset for whatever day you choose for insertion.  I can see how one might forget they even have it in them.  I do not feel it, my husband cannot feel it, and it has not fallen out, like several other women have claimed.  I'm very pleased with this and hope that it works as well for others as it has for me.
2998	restoril	5	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	Allowed me to fall asleep and stay asleep for the first week.	Drowsiness during the day, drowsiness and disorientation during the night after taking the tablet.	I took one 10mg tablet every night and it was very effective for the first week or so. Then after the first week I found that one tablet wasn't very effective, I had trouble falling asleep and also woke up several times during the night. I took 2 tablets for the next few days and it worked well, but after that it wasn't working well anymore so I took 4 tablets one night. The sleep was very disturbed, I kept falling in and out of sleep all night, and felt extremely drowsy and disorientated. I discontinued the use of this drug immediately as I realized I had quickly built a tolerance to it and wasn't effective anymore, even with 40mg.
2322	lexapro	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	ocd	Wanting to be drug free, I weened myself off of the Wellbutrin, but found that I could not happily function without the Lexapro.  When I tried to lower (self medicate) the dosage, my racing and repeating thoughts came back really strong.  I started counting again, repeating sentences in my head, singing song verses over and over in my head, replaying conversations over in my head, etc.  Being back on the 20mg keeps me feeling normal and only in very stressful situations do I start obsessing/repeating.	"I didn't experience any side effects.  I purposely did not read what the potential side effects might be, as I tend to ""develop"" whatever I read about."	"The initial treatment involved the medication and weekly therapy sessions.  A year into the treatment, I was able to scale the therapy back to ""as needed"" appointments, a year later I went off of the Wellbutrin and now feel pretty healthy just on the Lexapro."
3825	depakene	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	tonic clonic seizures	Moderate seizure control, seizures controlled during the awake hours, however, still uncontrolled during sleep.  Patient has multiple, short seizures, nightly.	Side effects were at first loss of appetite, then later, increased appetite.  Also some irritability which we cannot be sure but may be related to the drug.  However, it could be due to the nighttime seizures which are still occurring.	Take 500 mg of Valproic Acid before bed, daily, and 375 mg at breakfast, daily.  This dose was titrated up slowly and eventually stopped at this level. Blood work is done to check the blood trough level.  We are instructed to contact the physician should the seizure pattern change.
1545	methotrexate	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	juvenile rheumatoid arthritis	Methotrexate significantly reduced my daughter's arthritis symptoms, allowing her to resume a normal, active life without joint pain.  After being treated with this drug, she has remained symptom free for several years now.  She did not have to progress to more expensive arthritis drugs since she responded well to methotrexate.	Thinning hair, weight gain.  We don't know if these were due to the methotrexate or other drugs she was on.	She took the dosage once a week for about a year, and eventually was weaned off of all her arthritis related drugs.
3914	nexium	1	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	acic reflux	The treatment benefits are that it has stopped  the acid from coming up into my esphogus.  I also has benefited from further damage to my esphogus from the acid reflux. I do not have bad breath from the acid and i am no longer horse in my throat when i talk alot. The nexxium has stopped my stomach from producing acid.	After about a couple of months i began to experience severe stomach cramping, bloating, and diareaha.  My body is now completely depended on the drug and my understanding is that the pill is telling my body not to produce acid which in turn works harder to produce more, which makes since when i have tried to go off of it my acid reflux was 20 times worse.  My body has become completely dependent on the drug.	The treatment details were that i did not need to change my diet, but to just take one pill every day and that would take care of my issue with my body producing to much acid.
2661	ceclor	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	upper respiratory infection on vacation	none - ended up in emergency room	Skin rash over entire body, delirium, incapacitating bone/muscle/joint pain, anaphylactic symptoms	Went to urgent care while on vacation for upper respiratory infection.  Was given Ceclor even though I am allergic to penicillin, but I was unfamiliar with drug and away from my regular pharmacist.  Don't know if I felt better (cold/cough - wise) becasue my drug reaction was so severe I was in bed for days.
1885	doxycycline	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	perioral dermatitis	There was a persistent area of blister like bumps on lower face similar to acne but without resolution.  With this treatment, the bumps disappeared and didn't return for one year.	Slight nausea if not taken with food.  No other side effects were noted.	Topical and oral antifungals and anti virals were tried.  Additionally, topical corticosteroids were attempted with no results.  Within days of beginning the doxycycline, the rash began to disappear and didn't return for almost a year.  Again the cycle began a year later with immediate start of doxycycline and the same results as the previous year.  I understand that peri oral dermatitis is not uncommon in women of my age and is thought to be hormone and stress related, much like acne in adolecents.
356	neurontin	2	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	post herpatic neuralga	Slight alleviation of PHN pain.	Constant and severe drowiness; irritability to the max, actually wanted to kill someone, anyone; blurred vision; headaches; sinus pressure; walking imbalance; increased appetite; difficulty urinating; zero libido.	Standard treatment, 1st day 1 pill, 2nd day two, 3rd and thereon 3. The side efects started with the first pill and just steadily got worse to the point of suicidal thoughts. Even after being off the drug, the irritability and negative attitude have lingered, hopefully not permanently.
610	innofem	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	hot flashes, unable to sleep	I did get relief from the hot flashes and this did contribute to a good nights sleep. I had a hystirectomy a year before I was put on the hormones. I say an increase in wrinkles in that first year. I can not say that I have seen a slowing in the aging process but I am sleeping better and that of course will bennefit the skin.	I have not experienced any side effects to my knowledge. I feel as if an increase in the dose would maybe last longer as I seem to be waking at least once a night with a hot flash. I take it in the morning so maybe by the time I hit the sheets it is out of my system. I do not miss a day and always take it at the same time each morning.	As I stated I had a hystirectomy at 50 years old. I went over a year w/out any homone treatment and the hot flashes got so severe I was waking about 5 to 6 times a night. I was using over the counter sleep aids and did not like them. I got the doctor to prescribe the hormones and the benefits were almost immediate. I have been on the same dose for over a year now and feel I might benefit from an increased dose. I am 54 now and am looking not quite my age but the aging process is speeding up I feel.
3648	retin-a	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	fine lines	the cream did reduce fine lines but my skin peeled first so I only usie it oc.casionally now. I would use it, the skin would peel and the lines are slightly reduced. It also dries up blemishes	peeling, dryness, slight irritation. There weren't any serious side effects.  the packaging warns about sun exposure but I stay away from the sun so I did not have a reaction from the sun while using product.	I used this cream a few times a week at first and now I use it only occasionally. It is a moderately thick white cream that I applied only to target areas, frown lines, forehead, etc. Also applied to breakouts. The skin would peel slightly after a day or two and then new skin is revealed underneath. This is a very easy way to treat very fine lines.
239	wellbutrin-xl	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression, fatigue	Wellbutrin XL made a real difference in my life.  I had a tendency to get unnerved and anxious at the smallest things and since taking Wellbutrin, my husband has noticed a huge difference in my disposition.  I was not a majorly depressed person, just mildly depressed and fatigued, and also becoming uninterested in activities that I used to enjoy.  Wellbutrin definitely made me feel happier and more interested in life. As far as the rumor goes of Wellbutrin enhancing sexual desire - I have not noticed a diffence in myself in that regard.	I have to take the pill at night.  If I take the pill in the morning, I notice that I get a headache about 2p.	I take 300mg once a day and I've been on Wellbutrin for 2 years now and my doctor said there is no reason to stop taking it.
4076	mobic	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	pain from pinched nerve	Meloxicam was prescribed after Vioxx was taken off the market.  It has been beneficial in relieving the pain from a pinched nerve.  (The pain goes from the left side of my forehead, down my face, my neck, my shoulder, and my left arm).  I sometimes wonder if I really need it, so occasionally I stop taking it, but within 3 to 4 days, the pain comes back full force, so I know it is effective.  It is slightly less effective than Vioxx.	I have had no side effects at all.	Once per day to manage pain.  I have been on this medication for several years, and imagine I will need it for the rest of my life.
3545	vivelle-dot	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hot flashes/ over all feel better	Hot flashes are not as often and not so intense.The patch is very easy to use. I can not tell I'm wearing one. I no longer have night sweats.

3369	lipitor	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	high cholesteol	My blood tests indicated that I had high cholesterol.  I started taking this soon after, and approx. one month into taking this product, my cholesterol numbers have dramatically decreased.  My physician attributes this to lipitor as well as diet and exercise.  I have not experienced any side effects.	I have been fortunate not to have experienced any side effects while taking this medication.	none
3166	prednisone	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	asthma	It decreased my wheeze after about 5days. The wheeze became intermittent from then but did not go away and after 2days of not taking prednisone the symptoms returned, not as bad as they originally were though. Am now on so had another course of prednisone.	Leg Pain! The first day,i couldnt drive home they were so sore. Insomnia, I am writting this at 5am because im stil not asleep. Very exhaused on the high dose and got the 'buzz', on the lower dose where i bacame very wired and had trouble concentrating. When i first wake up my face, esp eyes, are very puffy but it seems to go down with in an hour. Dry mouth, metallic taste in my mouth. Increased hunger and thirst. Hot flushes. Few irrational mood swings but nothing to serious. Am taking the second course at the moment and the side effects dont seem to be as bad besides the insomnia but am only on day 2 of the course and am home from work with a cold i picked up at the end of the 1st course that i cant seem to get rid of so im guessing i would have the same side effects if i was doing my normal daily work.	Was put on Prednisone for asthma which i have not suffered from since i was a child. Had 6weeks of a cough which i though was a developing chest infection that i was fighting off as never turned into anything and i felt fine. My wheeze got really bad so went to gp who put me straight on prednisone. After 5days the wheezing decreased and i felt slightly better. 2days after stopping my course i was getting wheezy again and starting coughing more. Went back to the gp and he put me on another course of prednisone which i am taking at the moment along with a salbutamol inhaler.

2815	wellbutrin	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Lifting of mood.	No noticeable side-effects from the brand name, problems with generic.  Details in next section.	"I began taking Wellbutrin about 3 years ago.  At some point, I realized the generic was available and switched to it.  I did not anticipate any difference in effectiveness or side effects as I thought the generic was chemically identical to the brand, minus the ink used to print ""Wellbutrin"" on the pills.  It took about a month before I thought switching to the generic might even be related to the onset of irritability and subjective experience of ""heart pounding.""  I switched back to the name brand and the negative side effects disappeared almost immediately.  Also during the period of irritability (and pulse increase, I think, but I didn't actually take my pulse), I had a blood vessel burst in my hand.  This was not a surface capillary, but a deep vessel, that caused a bruise to appear on both sides of my hand.  The bursting was not associated with any trauma to the hand, but seemed rather spontaneous."
3282	zoloft	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pms	It really evened my mood. I was not irritable at all.	It significantly lowered my sex drive	I was taking this medication to help my PMS. I was supposed to use it long term, but I decided to stop because it effective my sex life. I found by changing bad eating habits and getting into a daily exercise routine, help alot.
374	lamotrigine	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	seizure-1st and only at age 41	Allowed to drive again after build up to therapeudic level	Initially, very tired in evening but that subsided within a few weeks. After that, I noticed small bumps on my whole scalp where follicles were-if I scratched one, a tiny white hard follicle emerged  and a hair never grew back at the site. Although the thinning was noticeable to me, no one else noticed and the neurologist didn't agree that the medicine caused hair loss. Luckily that side effect subsided within 3-6 months.	Took 12 weeks to get to correct level and couldn't drive during that time

Because everyone is complaining that they cannot get off of it now..."

I had swelling of my hands and face, lethargy, drugged feeling but when I ran out of it over a weekend and had to go 3 days without it I experienced severe withdrawal symptoms, itching, skin crawling, insomnia, etc so I quit taking it"	100 mg. 3 X day for about 3 months for fibromyalgia

1131	evista	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	osteoporosis/bone stength	the benefits weren't noticed per needed. I couldn't tell if the back spine was stronger as I felt the same.	My gums really dried out and were sore and red, I had to have special treatment from a specialist for gum disease and scaling. He said it was the same as leaving a steak out of the refrigerator for a few days. Before that, my gums were in good shape!	dental specialist went under gums to deep clean and I had to have special care.  also, some teeth moved inward. This changed my teeth's ositions and now don't look as nice.

Would recommend to anybody.	None	Took it for two weeks every day, and then twice a week for maintenance - this is just enough.  Too bad that it does not come in the cream form as well - would be more convenient then the suppository.
3112	ortho-tri-cyclen	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	Well, I never had sex without a condom, so I wouldn't really know. But, I guess it would be okay. not many people seem to have many problems with it.	really moody.	It's sorta hard to remember to take it, but its alright. I'm really not liking the moodiness though. little things really get on my nerves.
3396	clobex	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	contact dermatitis	Clobex was effective in resolving minor contact dermatitis. It soothed the irritation and lessened the dermatitis rather quickly however, it was also used for what was thought as dermatitis around the mouth. Use continued for six months with no results. The rash was exacerbated by heat and a diagnosis of MRSA was made. The Clobex, due to steroids in the cream, did not clear the lesions but rather made them worse. Use was discontinued and Bactroban and Septra DS was highly effective at clearing the infection. Have since had no need for Clobex and have used alternate methods for any incidental dermatitis that may occur. For those who chose to traditional medications, I can recommend Clobex for mild to severe dermatitis. I was satisfied with the results, except for the misdiagnosis of Skin MRSA, yet glad to know from experience, the difference between these two rashes.	none	Had developed contact dermatitis on my arm; cause unknown. dermatologist prescibed Clobex .05% BID until condition cleared. The solution went on easily, non-greasy and calmed any itching. No bandaging was needed. The dermatitis cleared quickly and no follow-up was necessary.

2508	delestrogen	10	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	total hysterectomy	Keeping me from the effects of menopause.	I believe the benefits were to keep my skin soft, prevent sagging and wrinkles	I was prescribed estrogen at the time of my total hysterectomy (due to increasing bleeding and starting periods every 2 weeks). I was becoming anemic from the bleeding and other procedures to stop this were not very successful. I was about 45 at the time and was given the option to begin HRT. Over the years I have been given decreasing levels and am currently at .5mg. Even with the negative info regarding prolonged HRT, I opted to continue.  If you actually read the negative information, it was not related to estrogen, but rather to estrogen and progesterone in combination.  Since then more articles have further clarified some of the mis-information.  It may be a risk to continue long term HRT, but none of my doctors has really presented any solid reasoning to discontinue HRT.

3837	lumigan	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	glaucoma	Lumigan worked fairly well regulating eye pressure for over five years, however less effectively in the past year. A second drug was added (Timilol)to further reduce eye pressure.  Lumigan taken p.m. Timilol taken a.m.	Lumigan did make my eyelashes grow. In the outside corner just under the eye small hairs grow where the medication tends to drip during administration.	Lumigan is taken at bedtime - one drop in each eye.

2931	quibron-t	5	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	asthma	the medication kept my asthma under control or so i thought.    as an aside, i still have a few left and every so often if i am out of my migraine medication, i will take a theodur and it seems to alleviate the headache.  it was inexpensive.	while I was on it, i never really experienced any side effects. except one time when i accidently took too much and became dizzy and nauseaus. when i went off it i suffered two weeks of migraines due to withdrawal.	i took 300 mg. twice a day and also used an inhaler regularly.   i assumed it was as good as it gets.  my new asthma specialist determined i had suffered some loss of lung function as the asthma had not been controlled as well as it could have been.  i had to have regular blood work to determine the levels were right.

Decreased libido (which was temporary)	"After about a week of taking the medication, I felt ""like myself"" again and not like a crazy person. I had felt that depression and anxiety were takin gover my personality. The medication neutralized these feelings."
382	corgard	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	mytral valve prolapse	The medication works very well in conjunction with the Quinadine Gluconate to help calm the extra heart beats.  I started on the medication when I was 19 and am still on it today at age 50.  I've tried other new drugs but always seem to come back to this tried and true one.	The only complaint I have is that Corgard tends to lower your blood sugar if you are prone to that anyway.  If I increased my dosages to over 20mg daily, I would have many problems with low blood sugar, even to the point of passing out.  I learned how to deal with it, but wish it was not a side effect.	I was put on Corgard because of the Mytral Valve prolapse.  I am very symptomatic.  This greatly reduced the skipped beats. I take 1 tablet at night before going to bed.
3311	zoloft	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	nerves, depression	I felt calmer and my overall outlook was better. It was subtle...still had some nerve problems and anxiety, but my guess is thats because it does not erase problems...but you can tolerate them better over the long haul.	none that I noticed.	I had alot of grief and was nervous at work, so my MD gave me this medicine to help with those problems.  It did help a bit with the physical nerve problem...less jittery and all that...but it didnt stop it completely.  I was able to function and not feel light headed or fuzzy...which I did not want. So that was a plus...I stayed on it for aprox 1 year...then lost my healthcare insurance so I no longer take it.
2602	ortho-tri-cyclen-lo	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	pregnancy prevention	Prevented pregnancy, acne was lighter, predictable periods	Extreme nausea for first 3 months, migraines during 4th month, contact lense use was disrupted, some weight gain (about 3-5 pounds) after the 3rd month, moodiness, lethargic, increased appetite, breast tenderness and enlargement	The side effects were very severe. Sometimes I thought I was pregnant because the side effects are similar to those of pregnant women. However, during the placebo pills, my period always came. I spoke with my pharmacist and she said if I have such side effects with this lower dosage I might get more severe effects with the higher dose.  I am still taking this hoping to ride out the side effects as the severity seems to lessen over time.
1513	lotrel	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine headaches	There was a huge reduction in the number of migraine headaches that I experienced.  Before I started on the meds, I was getting migraines 3-4 times per week.  Now I get them once or twice a year.  I think the daily meds may even slightly reduce the rate at which a migraine (the rare times that I get them now) comes on.	I do experience a slight cough.  It isn't a major problem; it only happens maybe a couple times a week and it is sort of like a cough you would use to clear a tickle from your throat.	I take one pill daily and have to visit my physician every six months.
3336	clarithromycin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	lower respiratory tract infection	It clears the infection in the sinus and lower respiratory tract.

Prescribed the ranitidine originally.  When mentioning the occassional acidic taste in the morning, the doctor changed me to Prevacid which took away both the heartburn and the taste.  But when I looked at the package insert through the Prevacid website this showed more carcinogenic results than the ranitidine which is next to none.  So I am taking only ranitidine from now on.
1328	prevacid	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	Most of the adverse acid reflex symptoms went away after several months of taking the drug. After a full course of treatment, I would only get hearburn and hunge pains if I would abuse the acid triggering foods.	No side effects.	Take a pill every morning at least 30 mins before eating.

1240	sotret	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	serious acne	I used to have a serious acne problems starting from age 14, at 16 I started to see a skin specialist.   After a month of taking this medication I saw a good result, my acne started to clear off within 2 months there were minimal acne, after 4 months no more acne, (just occasionally one or two popped up)  It worked well on by drying up my oil glands so my face were less oily and it helped fixing up my scars as well.	The visible side effects were dryness on my lips and throat.  So drinking more water is essential and occasionally applied some lip balm.  Other than that nothing that I felt or noticed of.  Other side effects were it may increase blood pressure and damage liver tissues if taking too long without doctor care.	Doctor prescribed 2 weeks of antibiotic to clear off my break out with some antibiotic cream and of course sun block, followed by roaccutane 20 mg for the first two months 1 capsule a day and after seeing a good result he advised me to maintain a low dose of one every other day for another eight months. That was the maximum dose I can take after which calculated against my weight.
2249	zovirax	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	cold sores/ herpes i	For awhile it did prevent cold sores. Then I started having frequent chest pains as well as fainting spells. Now I'm finding out from an ER Physician and the Pharmacist I 1. should never have been prescribed this dosage (twice what should be prescribed in per day) and NO-ONE should take Acyclovir for this length of time either. I've been told this is the reason for my fainting spells, chest pain, low blood pressure problems, increased kidney (renal) damage, yeast infections and most recently a series of fungal infections.	fainting spells, chest pain, low blood pressure, further kidney damage, infections followed up with fungal infections. I now am taking 1000 mg of L-Lysiene (natural food store or grocery store) per day. It's extrememly low cost and it's very effective.	I hope this information will help someone not go through what I've gone through. I don't have chest pain since I've quit using it after one week. I was never even given one liver functioning test on this at all and that is reccommended by the way. Good Luck and take care.

"Dry skin and lips, increased susceptibility to developing blisters on feet if walking long distances without careful attention to socks and shoes.  Stupidly used ""Biore"" skin strips early in the treatment to speed up removal of the blackheads and pulled all the skin off my nose."	"I am 43 now but took Accutane back in my early 20's for moderate cyctic acne.  I took a second course in my 30's for mild/moderate non-cystic acne which was probably hormone related.  I absolutely loved taking Accutane and wished that I could take it again at a milder dosage to treat blackheads and have that smooth ""poreless"" skin again.  It seems to speed up skin cell sloughing and I didn't need to exfoliate, just use a good cream.  After years of taking antibiotics and using awful creams that made my skin dry and red, Accutane was a godsend.  My older brother and sister have terrible deep scars from cystic acne (my sister had dermabrasion many years ago before the age of laser) but I do not have one scar from my cyctic acne."
3218	copaxone	8	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	multiple sclerosis	Peace of mind that I am doing something to decrease the MS progression.	Site reactions: pain, redness, lumps, flush of heat, itchiness	I was on copaxone over a year ago and quit because I found the reactions unbearable. My health has declined and I changed doctors and now that I have found the confidence to accept my disease and become more proactive, I have begun applying heat to the site prior to injection. The pain from the shots have practically disappeared. I actually purchased a massager (heart massager from pure romance) that self heats and I don't have to do so much work prior to injection. I still get large red lumps if I don't put ice on it after the injection.

2805	wellbutrin	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bipolar disorder	Nearly complete control of bipolar condition, except in times of stress. It worked very well for me, even though I tried almost all the SSRIs over the years.	Dry mouth became a problem after years of use. No other side effects were a problem.

For good reasons (not typical lupus, plus 'you know your body best'), my Doc and Consultant basically leave me to decide my dosage! After 3 years I have learnt that when I have the 1st definite signs of a flare-up (pericarditis symptom, ie pressure in neck when bending over), I need to put the dose up to 30mg straight away - from trial and error, anything less just doesn't work, ie putting dose up to e.g. 15mg, then 20mg, then 25mg gives the flare-up more time to really get hold of me! Am trying to decide whether to take 'steroid-sparing' drug Azathioprine as well...v hard decision as it's a serious immune suppressant and has scary side-effects. Hey ho! (Once tried 35mg for a couple of days when 30mg wasn't quite sorting it, and got tingly lips - checked online and thought it could be a sign of calcium deficiency; called Doc, he agreed (!) so went back down to 30mg and was fine.)

In the beginning I was advized to take the drug 1 hour before the previous one wore off as it can take up to 1 hour for it to work. The pain however always did go away and therefore relieving me of it and making me feel comfortable again.	After using the drug for a while I was becoming more and more dependant on it. Therefore I was becomming addicted to this drug as I was depending on it to relieve my pain. I also noticed that while taking this drug I was becoming constipated where in the past that has never been an issue for me.	This medication was prescribed to me following my knee arthroplasty. I had a surgery done on my knee where the joints have been replaced. following the surgery I had severe pain and so the doctor as opposed to morphine prescribed OxyContin. I was taking this drug 3 times a day and later 2 to 3 times depending on my pain. The drug worked very well and I was satisfied with it.

It was almost as if thinking negatively became impossible. Consequently, panic attacks and depression diminished greatly.

Missing the drug for consecutive days quickly (in ~40 hours) triggered a single withdrawal symptom: brain zaps. Each zap lasted about 0.5 seconds, and seemed to be triggered by ""mild sensory overloads"", e.g., entering a room with different lighting conditions. The zaps were not painful at all, just confusing and (initially) frightening. Upon resuming the drug, the zaps disappeared as quickly as they had appeared (~20 h)."	Treatment was initiated by a general practictioner for self-reported tiredness and panic attacks. The next appointment was in two weeks. Since there were no continuing side effects, and the drug seemed effective, we decided to continue it for at least 6 months. I have now been taking it for 3 months.

On 10/31/07 these were my readings My AST was 384 instead of 10-35,  My Alt was 655 instead of 6-40,  By 5/1/08 after I stopped taking it for 7 months my readings were AST 37 and ALT 76 a big improvement	"I couldn't walk because of muscle problems.  Then it attacked my kidney and bladder.  Drs thought I had cancer.

Reduced dosage from 20 mg to 10mg.  Had to get off it and through away about $200.00 worth of pills."
769	naproxen	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	period cramps	I was able to do normal daily activities again	I had no side effects.	I always have had really bad cramps. I have tried many different prescription pain killers over the years and none have really made the pain any better. I first started taking Naproxen in 200mg as you can get this over the counter as Aleve in the States. Canada has no such product available. I found that even  in 200 mg strength sometimes was enough to make my day bearable. I now get it from my Dr. in 500 mg strength and am able to carry out my normal daily activities as I was unable to even go to work some days before.
3414	aricept	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	alzheimers	"Only moderate improvements noted on the 5g dosage.    
Improvements much more noticeable at 10g - or after 30 days of taking medication.   Less confusion, more awareness in social surroundings, more outward and positive in attitude."	So far no negative noted	"Take one pill in the morning.

Also vitamin supplements (Multi-vitamin, brain-booster vitamin, and homo-cysteine level reducer)"
3532	lunesta	1	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	sleeplessness	I was able to sleep	Violent nightmares.  Sleep-walking.  Two of the many examples:  Got up and took a bath with NO recollection.  Another time got up and BAKED COOKIES...made the dough, baked the cookies, cleaned up the kitchen, put the cookies in the jar....with not ONE recollection I did it.	Was told I fall into the low percentage of people who have these same side-effects.  Taken off Lunesta and cannot take Ambian for the same reasons.  Tried Melatonin, 5mg a night...works like a charm and I haven't been in the kitchen baking!
2441	wellbutrin-sr	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	i dont think i felt anything positive, no mood change, just the same really although i am smoking a lot less, it does a good job of taking away cravings for nicotine	anxiety, anxiety, anxiety	to take 2 daily, the results are meant to be felt about 1 month after starting treatment
3392	coumadin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	dvt	The drug dissolved the clots over time and the pain and swelling  mainly subsided unless I was on my feet standing in one place for a long period of time.	"I had to watch my diet for foods that would affect the clotting time of the drug.  I.E. a margarita would thin my blood but guacamole would make it thicker.
Also I had to be careful not to cut myself while shaving since my blood was thinner that normal and would bleed a long time."	"I have had two episodes of thrombophlebitis with deep vein thrombosis diagnosed the first time with a veinogram, and the second time with an ultrasound.  I was hospitalized 11 days each time and put on heparin through an IV with complete bedrest.  When I was released I had follow up medication of coumadin for 6 months with prothrombin time testing every few days to moniter and adjust the dosages.
After that I began developing vericose veins that I had treated with sclerotherapy and infrared venous closure procedures of the saphenous vein for venous insufficiency."
1756	topamax	4	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	migraines	My headaches were not as severe as they were before I started the medication but I still had headaches, just not as many and not as severe.	I had no appetite which caused me to lose 10 pounds in a month. Also not having an appetite made me not eat enough, so I would get more headaches because I wasn't eating enough. I also felt very depressed on this medication. During the time I was on topamax I slept a lot and didn't eat enough, I didn't feel like I was myself.	I took 25 mg for two weeks at night, then 50 mg for the next two weeks, then 75 mg for the next two then I went down to 50 mg for three days then to 25 mg for three days and I have discontinued the medication.
2928	tramadol	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	shoulder pain	relief of pain	agitation, insomnia	This drug was prescribed for pain caused by therapy for frozen shoulder. The pain was making it impossible to sleep at night, so the doctor prescribed tramadol. While the drug did moderate the pain, it also caused agitation, anxiety, insomnia. I stopped taking it after a few days. I also stopped the therapy. The pain went away and my shoulder improved on its own.
791	ambien	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sleeplessness	More often than not, I was able to sleep for 3-4 hours of uninterrupted sleep.	"Restless leg syndrome may be aggravated if Ambien and elevil are taken at the same time.  I stopped taking elevil for RLS on the nights I took ambien.  Sometimes the RLS was still aggravated even though I did not take elevil.
Short term memory loss.
Binge eating at night."	Ambien, the brand name product seemed to work better than the generics.  I only take the generic, zolpidem once in a while.  I have asked my doctor to prescribe Ambien CR to see if it will be more effective.
2162	zyrtec	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	eczyma	Severe case of eczyma which cleared almost immediately after starting zyrtec	none	After several over the counter attempts to clear the rash which was maily on her legs and abdomen we saw a dermatologist.  He prescribed Zyrtec.  He explained that eczyma was an allergic reaction and the antihistamine effect would help.  We were already using ALL free to wash the clothes and using mild soaps.  I was skeptical but it worked fantasticly.
3691	effexor-xr	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	depression	none	"dilated pupils

3719	lamictal	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	mood swings	It took a while since the dose increases so slowly, but I started to realize that I wasn't reacting so severly to my daily emotional changes. If I was upset about something, I wasn't experiencing the sever mood swings I normally would. My frustration and anger no longer controlled me. A general sense of being able to handle my negative emotions without falling apart. My family noticed a big difference.	in the beginning I had symptoms of vertigo which occured when turning my head or standing quickly. The dizziness felt worse each time the medication dose was increased and eventually stopped or was significantly less pronounced. The feelings lasted about 2-6 weeks. Some weight gain.	I was seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for over a year and had tried 4-5 medications for depression, some worked temporarily, some not at all. Both therapists thought my symptoms indicated Bipolar II and I should try a different approach. I stared on a very low dose, as indicated, so the benefits took a while to notice. When I reached 150 mg, thought it was too much so dropped back down to 100mg and have been on this dose for about 18 months. i have a med check 3-4 times a year.
4083	mobic	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	rotator cuff tear	After a rotater cuff injury three years ago i was given mobic for pain and aching that was interfering with sleep. Mobic decreased the pain considerably.  I did not have pain or discomfort from the arthritis. i was just told i had some arthritic changes.	i did not have any noticeable side effects, however, since my shoulder healed I have been unable to stop the medication without pain and discomfort in my muscles and joints - that was not present prior to taking the medicine. I know the potential side effects and just recently tried natural alternative anti-inflammatories I have stopped all my medicine except the hormones, atacand and the mobic.	"The treatment was Mobic 15mg daily started 3 years ago after the shoulder injury.
At that time I also attended Physical Therapy and was discharged from PT after 3-4 months of therapy."
421	imitrex	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine	Amazing results with minimal side effects.  I suffered from severe headaches for years before finally consulting with a neurologist.  Imitrex was life changing because I no longer worried about getting a migraine, which in turn reduced the number I was getting!	Tingling in the back of my head and hands.  Warm, strange feeling when running hands under water.  All last for a short time and are well worth the relief.	Very simple - Take one pill when I felt like a migraine was coming on.
3459	tamiflu	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	flu	I fastly recovered from the virus and felt much better after the second administration of the drug.	I have not noticed anything special as side effects	The medicine was prescribed to me by my GP as I was in contact with pregnant women by the time and I was afraid that I will transfer the virus to them also.
2941	mirapex	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	restless leg syndrome	The benefits were remarkable and fast.  Before taking the mirapex, the patient got very little sleep and consequently was irritable.  After taking the mirapex, the restless legs calmed down immediately.  The patient can now go to a movie, take a trip in a car and sleep with a reasonable amount of comfort.  The restless legs are not totally cured, but it is manageable now.  Even working 8 hours a day is much more manageable.	The only side effect that the patient experienced was drowsiness and that has weakened as time has gone by.  With only taking one pill at noon, the drowsiness is not marked and does not interfere with work or anything else.  The patient takes 2 pills around 8 or 9:00 at night so the drowsiness is not a problem.	The patient developed restless leg syndrome around the age of 35 after a boating accident where her back was injured.  The doctors do not know if the back injury brought on the restless legs or not.  The patient went to many doctors and neurologists.  The doctors tried many medicines but with no success.  Finally the patient found a neurologist in central Kansas that figured out immediately what was wrong.  The doctor put the patient on mirapex on a trial basis after performing many tests to rule out other causes or problems.  The patient has never been on another medicine for restless legs since going on the mirapex.  The  patient does take a multivitamin with iron in it to help with the restless legs and the patient also does not have caffeine drinks.
4129	chantix	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	after 42 years, quit smoking	Craving reduced.  Smoked first week and two days of second week.  Find I don't think about having a smoke when first get up or right after eating all the time.  But I still do have cravings at times.  The cravings are manageable.	Only side effect was in the first couple of days, I would feel light headed at times.  I have dreams I remember now verses not remembering them before the drug.  Any other side effect could be contributed to the other medicines I have to take so I can't say if the mood swings or sleeping habits are due to the Chantix.  Major side effect is the cost.  This drug costs two and half times as much as my smoking habit per month.	I did the starter packet for the first seven days as prescriped.  Now I am on the 1mg twice a day.
1884	doxycycline	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	"Much reduced occurrence of papules and pustules.
Increased healing time and generally results in a clearer skin.

The combination of topical benzoyl peroxide with oral doxycycline seem to synergistic reducing the severity of acne."	None. But reduction of dosage seem to bring about the recurrence of acne.	Doxycycline was administered in the form of a capsule. Taken orally with a full glass of water for each dose of capsule. It was taken once a day.
2628	depo-provera	1	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	birth control	Birth Control	Massive weight gain, 22kgs (?48pounds) in the first 3months. Massive mood changes, bacame very depressed (weight gain didnt help that one) Was emotional about the smallest things. Anxiety attacks. Angry over small things. Nightmares and sleep walking and talking ? if these are side effect of that drug but there was a definate increase in both (esp sleep talking) when i was on the drug. Increased appitite (the weight didnt come from nowhere) was warned about pos weight gain but was told that if you controlled your eating youd be fine but my hunger was crazy i would eat a main meal and 1/2 hour later be starving like i hadnt eaten all day. I found it really hard to control my intake due to my excessive hunger. I also had heavy spotting the whole time i was on it and for about 5 months after i stopped the injections. I guess it was a very effective birth control as i had become depressed, overweight, had my period the whole time and was more interested in food than sex. Over all was not worth taking it, i actually regret taking it, was devestating for a 18year old at the time to go through.  I also found it very hard to loose the weight during or afterwards, continued to gain weight for 6months after the last injection before any changes occured despite exercise and diet changes.	Birth control, 2x doses over 6months before i decided to stop treatment.
3858	levoxyl	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroid problem	made me feel normal	none	i have to take a peel every morning at the same time.if i dont and i forget i get tired its a different kind of tired though.once they stopped giving me the pill for 7 weeks and my hair started falling out i was lethargik i thought i was moving fast but i was moving very slow.i bloated up,i started to think kind of weird.i wanted to sleep all the time i was a real mess.so i take the medication consistantley the best i can.
2151	zyrtec	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergies	helped decrease reactions to common allergens. I have hay fever every spring and Zyrtec helped with the common symptoms of hay fever. Helped decrease sneezing, runny nose and decreased reactivity to allergens experienced during the spring season when my allergies are the worst.	dry nose, slight bleeding of nose. Otherwise, no other symptoms, no drowsiness, no nausea or any other side effects	took as symptoms of seasonal allergies started. Used primarily 1 pill per day maybe 3-5 times per week from April to September.
802	ambien	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	insomnia	regulate sleep	short psychotic episodes, sleep-walking.	In an effort to regulate sleep, during an extended period of insomnia; patient was prescribed Ambien. The medication induced sleep as often as it induced short periods of psychotic behavior and patient was difficult to control by family. Patient would sleep-walk with no memory of it afterwards. Patient was beligerent with family members and appeared severly intoxicated.
1881	doxycycline	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	acne	There was an improvement in the healing time for acne	Severe acid stomach and cramping, to the point where I could no longer take the medicine.  I stopped taking Doxycycline for a year and tried topical clindamycin and other potential treatments but none worked.  Therefore, I started on Doxycycline treatment again after a year as it had led to some improvement in my acne.  Within 3 days, I again had severe stomach acidity and cramping and had to stop taking it.	"50mg Doxycycline taken one at night with food, meant to be 2 - 3 month treatment for acne.  Unable to continue with treatment.

By the way, the most effective treatment I have now found for treating current acne is Freederm, a nicotinamide based product which is the only topical treatment I have found that improves my acne.  It does not prevent new acne outbreaks.

And the best treatment I have found for acid stomach is Barley Greens, better than all over the counter acid stomach treatments and better than Zoton."
2019	protonix	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	Effective in helping to control acid reflux	none that i know of at the present time. But i do not know what damage it has done if any to any of my internal organs.	One tablet once a day
2584	betaseron	8	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	multiple sclerosis	Storage of a drug may not seem important, but betaseron does not have to be refridgerated, which makes it highly portable.  But the main benefit is that the lesions that I was originally diagnosed with DID NOT WORSEN over time.  In addition,  I have had NO new lesions since beginning betaseron.  So this has helped to slow the progress (secondary progressive relapse/remit) and I believe decreased the amount of relapses with residual.  Which, if you have ms this is what you aim for.	I do, for some unknown reason, still have side effects from the betaseron.  They don't happen every injection, and there is no pattern.  I will have a fever and/or chills, and I hurt all over.  It feels sometimes like even my hair hurts:)   And my injection sites do have a tendency to form large red circles, but they are NOT infections, just a side effect.  And for some reason the injections on my legs hurt the worst.	I guess the treatment details are how I take it.  The injections are deep subcutaneous.  Because the drug is very hard on tissue, you can't inject into the same area.  Upper arms are divided into 6 imaginary sections, abdomen 6 areas, legs 6 areas, and buttocks 6.  So inject into first arm area on one arm, then next injection opposite arm, then abdomen, legs, and buttocks.  Then you must start over in the first arm, but a different section and then work your way down again.  This keeps tissue necrosis from occuring.  The injections are every other night, and come in a pre-measured syringe the must be mixed SLOWLY with the powder immediately before injection.  MAKE SURE to NOT agitate the sol'n, as it will foam, then you can't get it in the syringe, and then it's useless.
628	nortriptyline	3	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	panic attacks/feeling low	very little benefit, slept a bit better, still got anxiety, cant always sleep, offered valium as well for bad days, good days are wonderful, stressful time isnt over yet so body still goes into panic	dry mouth, thirst	25mg more than one month, given more for another month, unsure of the benefits, need to ask a professional about amitryptiline
496	meridia	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	obesity	BMI was 36 before I started Meridia.  After 4 monhts, BMI is 28.  Lost 43 pounds.  Increased energy and confidence.  Another benefit was an increase in alertness and confidence.  I had low blood pressure and was quite passive before, and with the medication felt an increase in energy and heart rate.  My behaviour changed - I became more assertive because I was more impatient than before.	Increased heart rate.  After day 9 on Meridia, felt hungry when my body was hungry - constant hunger stopped.	After day 9 on the medication, I no longer had that feeling of starving all the time. When I started Meridia, I also started the Jenny Craig program to educate myself on nutrition and get support.  My knowledge of nutrition was so limited that a nutritionist would not have been able to teach me such basic principles - I needed to be taught like a child.  I didn't know this at the time, but 4 monhts later, I know that was the right thing to do and why.
3457	tamiflu	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	swine flu	I took Tamiflu as soon as I knew I had contracted Swine Flu.  While it did not stop the flu in its tracks I did not get seriously ill and my recovery time was quite short.  Somo of my friends also contracted Swine Flu and did not take Tamiflu.  Two of them became very ill and it was several weeks before they coudl go back to work.  Their general energy levevls were low for about 2 months.  By contrast, I was never really bed bound and was out and about after about one week.  I did not experience any longer term effects.	Slight nausea at times	One table to be taken twice dailyn for five days
1627	premarin	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	vaginal dryness	improved vaginal lubrication, decreased sensitivity, improved urinary continence, improved urethral tone,	some breakthrough bleeding/spotting at the once a day dosage after fourteen days, very intermittent, did not persist after dose reduced to twice weekly.	Medicine was inserted vaginally  once daily at bedtime for the first 2 weeks; patient abstained from sexual intercourse during that time so that male partner would not be exposed to the effects of estrogen.
1793	citalopram	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	suicidal feelings	None. When I was last encountering depression 10 years ago, my Doctor gave me some round green pills whose name I can't rememeber. They worked well, helping numb my depression as I sorted out my life. After recent suicidal feelings regarding a reactive depression to losing my job, my GP prescribed me Citalopram. I just wanted something to numb me again as things got better(which they did) but these tablets nearly sent me crazy.	I took one late at night hoping to feel sleepy at least, but had one of the worst nights sleep of my life. I encountered sweating,shakes, jaw grinding, and horrible hallucinatory dreams whilst still awake.  My GP told me I had to take them for at least a fortnight to feel any effect so tried again the following night, but the side effects were even worse. The way my jaw and teeth would involuntairily chatter was scary as hell. If I did this every sleepless night for 2 weeks, I'd have ended up insane, so I stopped after after just 2 nights	I never went back to the doctor. I was so desperate for a good nights sleep without teeth-grinding and nightmares, I fell back on alcohol. I've never taken Valium, but feel I should've been given something similar - somthing that would heavily sedate me while I was feeling suicidal. Luckily after a week, my fortunes changed, and I found work again, so the suicidal feelings went.  But I would never take Citalopram again.
2219	allegra	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	allergies	Allergic reactions stopped almost immediately	Very dry skin and hyperactivity	Took medication when symptoms arose, stopped when subsided
1901	doxycycline	3	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sinus infection	it seemed to begin clearing up my sinuses but stopped taking it because of side effects after 2 days	my lips, mouth, and face began going numb and tingling after only first dose. i thought it was all in  my head until i continued the treatment and it kept getting worse. i had muscle spasms all over my body and a weird fluttering in my heart. it is/was horrible.	i first took zithromax for my sinuses but kept repeatedly throwing it up, so was prescribed doxycycline and decided the side effects were so bad i'd rather keep throwing up the zithromax.
794	ambien	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	helped me to fall asleep quickly	sort of sleep walk issue.  I was getting up in the middle of the night and eating.  Not realizing this until the next morning when I saw the mess I made in the kitchen	I was taking 100mg ambien each night for approximatley 2 weeks.  this was because I could not fall asleep.  the Ambien was very effective
2570	klonopin	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	insommnia	Initially did help with sleep. Over time tolerance developed and depression and grogginess ensued.	On attempting to withdraw very severe side effects of withdrawal that lasted over one year: personality changes, anxiety, severe sleeplessness. A disaster!	Withdrawal had to be done very slowly over several months. I would NEVER use benzodiazepines ever again. They are for single use only. Have since learned that even after a few days use there can be rebound effects. These drugs are dangerous. Period.
3720	lamictal	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	depression and anxiety	Generally, Lamictal has helped my depression (intense sadness, hopelessness) more than my anxiety (obsessions, excessive worrying). The mood difference is noticeable. My pscychiatrist prescribed Lamictal to me because, as a mood stabilizer, Lamictal is often used to treat resistant depression. Considering that I had previously taken seven different medications in failed attempts to treat depression, this was an appropriate choice.	I have noticed no side effects.	I take 100 MG of Lamictal orally, twice a day. Generally, I take the first pill when I wake up in the morning, and I take the second pill with dinner.
2427	synthroid	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	hypothyriod	none, I was very disappointed at the time because the doctor said that it going to take care of my problem. I had no energy.	It just didn't work and that was the side affects.	I was put on synthroid to cure a slow thyroid. It did not help and I discontinued use. I was changed to Armour Thyroid and have had fabulous results with it. Armour Throid is what was giving to before the drug companies came out with a synthetic version of it.
3945	prilosec	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	heart burn	My heart burn was relieved within forty eight hours and continued for the length of the treatment.  I was very satisfied with the results.	There were no side effects from taking this medicine.	I took the medicine once a day in the morning for 14 days.  Whenever heart burn reoccurs I repeat the treatment.
2289	lexapro	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	happier, slept better. The Lexapro helped with energy levels and anxiety; the Trazadone with sleep. Together they worked quite well, I thought, as I was peppier during the day and slept well at night. So all in all, I would say that this was an excellent combination for someone suffering from sleep deprivation, which contributed to depression, low energy, and anxiety. I felt cured	groggy sometimes. And I could not really stop, though I was able to play with the amount of the trazodone, lowering it down to 50 mg. whenever ever I could. I did not notice side effects from Lexapro, just perhaps that I became flat overtime--not depressed but no super excited either. So at a certain point, I wanted to get off. I had wonderful dreams on trazodone, but would sometimes go back to sleep in the morning for 1-3 extra hours.	50-150 mg of trazodone and 20 mg of lexapro daily. I took all at night, just before going to bed. I would when trying to bring the Trazodone down--so I would be less groggy in the morning-- go very slowly, 25 mg less every few days. Usually this would work. If I woke in the middle of the night, I would immediately get up and take another 50 mg. I have probably taken up to 250 mg in one night, but very rarely. And I have had long periods where I was at 50 mg, only taking more if I was really stressed out or my mind was buzzling with too many details. I recommend this combination really.
2976	strattera	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	adhd	Stratterra enabled me to concentrate and focus on tasks at hand.  It makes a world of difference in my daily life.  After four years of using Stratterra, I would never switch to a different ADHD medication.	Stratterra surpresses my appetite and makes me feel quite dependent on the drug to function. If I take with my multivitamin, I often feel nauseous.	I take 1 60 mg of Stratterra in the morning daily.
3390	coumadin	1	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	leg blood clot, dvt	The leg clot would not extend nor would other clots form, potentially causing death.	"These were severe and included extreme and continuous nausea, feeling generally shitty (technical term employed by patient), no libido and inability to maintain erection during sex, orgasms that petered out and gave little pleasure, no overall energy for life.
Patient decided to stop medication and try natural/alternative substance to thin the blood.  this resulted in an extension of the clot and increased severity of pain, leading to emergency room visit and subsequent use of different blood thinner, syntron."	Treatment included 2months of heparin injections in abdomen.  Coumadin was given daily after the injections were stopped, at 6mg. The discontinuation of this medication caused an extension of the clot and re-admittance to hospital and another drug for blood thinning was given.   Eventually, 6 months later, a doctor prescribed a compression stocking, which helped dramatically with swelling and pain.  The Syntron blood thinner had no noticeable side-effects.  Except possibly a still reduced libido.
417	imitrex	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	Improved my quality of life and was able to maintain a job for longer period of time. I have suffered with chronic severe migraines since the age of 4 with severe nausua resulting in 3 to 4 emergency room visits per month. I missed so much school, work and family events that I became unrealiable which later brought on depression. I still suffer today 44 years later with them but they are not as severe and I can now function in life somewhat normal. Imitrex gave me a chance to live my life the way I wanted to!	Usually a feel of tiredness 10 to 12 hours after initial dose which can last up to 24 hours. Taking one dose of the pill has less effects of tiredness then taking the 6mg shot or taking them both within a 24hr period.	After over the counter medications failed to relieve headache pain I could tell if the headache was triggering a migraine and at that time take the imitrex pill and the migraine would be totally gone within 30 minutes. If the migraine was to strong with nausea symptoms and the pill didn't work, I would then take a imitrex 6mg shot for almost instant relief including nausea. Very rarely will the imitrex not work and then I have to go to emergency room.
746	flonase	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	It cleared up my nasal allergies, opened up my nasal passages and stopped post nasal drip.	There were no side effects, but I was careful not to take it continuously for too long of a period of time, just in case.	I would do 2 sprays in each nostril once a day.  It would take about 36 hours to start feeling the benefit and about 3 days to get the full benefit.
2139	concerta	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	adult add	improved... focus, concentration, memory, organization, timeliness, mood, patience. Improved ability to attend to unpleasant tasks.	"dry-mouth (needed to maintain proper hydration, not necessarily hungry at meal time (switched to several smaller ""meals"" throughout the day)"	TR concerta in the morning. I found that it was most effective taken with water rather than juice.
1221	prozac	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression/stress	Having suffered with depression/anxiety after the break up of my marriage, during which I lost a huge amount of weight, couldn't sleep, was agitated, tearful etc etc. the fluoxetine initially helped me relax and gave me a 'holiday from myself'.  The effects totally calmed me, enabling me to resume my 'normal' life.  I regained my weight and although not totally free from the fluoxetine, have now cut down to every other day and have now been able to resume working.  My experience is that the fluoxetine have taken away the extreme mood swings.	No side effects as such.  However, the negative from my point of view is that there is an almost unreal calmness and lack of feeling/excitement/or even anger.........however as it is my intention to only use the fluoxetine for what is a relatively short term period, I beleive that this has been a 'symptom' worth experiencing.	20 mg once a day.
493	meridia	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	overweight	Lost 15 pounds and did not feel hungry while taking the medicine. On days that I forgot to take a capsule, I did feel hungry and it was not as easy to stick to my diet.	There were no side effects that I could trace directly to Meridia. Mild constipation is a possible side effect, but that could also have been due to dehydration.	I took one Meridia first thing in the morning and then stuck to a sensible diet for the day.  If I took the Meridia too late in the day, it did keep me from sleeping well that night.

1176	prozac	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	sleepiness	Ritalin made me get up. For the first time I wanted to work. It gave me the good sensation that I  could do things. I worked and worked like a bee. Therefor, depression was a thing of the past when I take this medication. It help my mind to focus and stay sharp.  I can concentrate better with this medication.	Taking prozac made me more sleepy and I could not get up to do everyday thing. I just kept sleeping or yawning.  I wanted my depresion to go away but it did the opposite. Instead of helping me keep me depresed I felted more depresed because I kept sleeping all the time. The medication Prozac with me did not help my depression but rather calm me to the extent that I did not want to do anything. Also I kept going to the bathroom constantly. It takes down my sexual mood and difficulty in getting aroused at all.  Ritalin cause my mouth to dry up and kept drinking water like a camel. Jittery effect and when the medication wear off you feel it like large thump.	Doctor suggested to take Prozac at night time and Ritalin twice a day. So far it has worked for me a patient suffering depression for more than 15 years and it has helped me the Ritalin. Cannot say about Prozac but I notice that I do not get anxiety attack with it.

3016	cipro	1	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	throat infection	"I had taken this medication, Cipro, as prescribed by my general practicioner to treat a strep throat infection.  The first time I used this medication, it was very effective with no side effects and after 3 days
of taking it, I noticed considerable improvement and then by the time the perscription was totally consumed, probably 10 days worth, the Strep throat was gone and all cleared up.  It was the second occasion of treating a similar illness that the side effects were detected."	"After one day of taking the cipro- so probably had 3 pills, I began to get an itchy rash mostly on my arms, legs, and abdomen.  There were small red dots that itched.  I also noticed that my throat swelled up and
it was getting harder to breath.  I called my Dr. and was told to quit taking the Cipro and an alternative
would be given to me."	So I think I have described the details as I can or needed in the descriptions listed above. complely
1350	crestor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	very high cholesterol and family history of heart	I didn't have any symptoms, so I don't feel any better or any worse after being on Crestor. My cholesterol has always been high during routine blood tests but around a year ago it had risen to 8 mmol/l (almost 300 ml/dl)and my HDL/LDL ratio was poor. Trigylserides were normal before taking Crestor after weight loss.	Surprisingly no side effects with Crestor even though it is the most potent of the statins. I had severe muscle pains with Lipitor and other statins and expected to have the same problems with Crestor. For some reason I didn't have these problems with Crestor.	I was started on 10mg and retested after 10 weeks. My LDL (bad cholesterol) dropped significantly, HDL rose slightly and triglyserides dropped slightly (they were already in the normal range before). My liver enzymes were high before taking Crestor but had returned to normal when retested after 10 weeks (I don't know if Crestor had anything to do with this or not). Blood sugar levels were normal before and after taking Crestor, but slightly lower after. I am due to be tested again before the end of this year and also have a Cardio Stress Test. After a new doctor reviewed my medical history, he suggested I have a stress test even though I still haven't experienced any symptoms of heart disease. All ECG results at rest have been normal.

3476	ambien-cr	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	insomnia	None.  It didn't help me sleep.  I was cranky the next day, depressed, and tired.	I took it for 2 days.  The third day I didn't take it.  Which was tonight.  I keep waking up because my subconsious is terrified of something.  I keep hearing things in my sleep.  I am terrified to go back to sleep. My heart is pounding from the horrible things I keep hearing in my sleep.  I never had this until taking this medication. I think I may miss a day of work tomorrow from not being able to sleep.  I wish someone was here with me so I wouldn't be so afraid to go back to sleep but the sounds I keep hearing are so terrifying.	My doctor gave me some samples for insomnia.

The first dermatologist to prescribe it wanted to put me on several weeks of antibiotics.  I really did not want the systemic side effects of that.  Also, I oppose the overuse of antibiotics because it leads to resistant bacteria.  So one benefit is that it gave him an alternative to antibiotics."	"Hard to say.  

During the fifteen years I took it, my pores enlarged and became clogged.  That may have been due to age and other factors--but I could not help but suspect that some of the heavy waxes and oils used in the product may have contributed.

Metrogel left an ashy white residue, so I switched to the cream.  Maybe the gel would have less clogging effect.  

Later, I got prescription insurance coverage and had to take a generic, which may have had even cheaper inactive ingredients."	"I never had a problem with rosacea.  I went to a dermatologist and was kept waiting two hours.  I was embarrassed because I kept literally falling asleep in the waiting room.  I asked the receptionist if I had time to run out and get a cup of coffee.  After I drank the coffee, my cheeks flushed bright red--that was the only symptom of rosacea.

After fifteen years and several changes of dermatologists, I got a new doctor and asked if the metronidazole could be causing enlarged pores.  When she found out that I never had pimples or pustules, she suggested I try not using the metronidazole at all.  I have not used it for the last six weeks and I see no change.  I prefer using a lighter moisturizer."

3745	lamictal	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	mood stabilization	The wellbutrin and effexor alone did improve the depression but the addition of the lamictal really made a significant improvement.  With just the two antidepressants I could still feel down and unmotivated, lethargic, hopeless at times.  But the lamictal prevented me from going down.  I have been diagnosed with dysthymia among other things and I have been told that there might be some sort of cycling akin to what manic-depressives have but of course not to that extreme.  The doctor was concerned initially about my diagnosis - the thought was that the diagnosis I had received (dysthimia) may have been wrong and really I was a manic-depressive (which I am not).  Apparently this is a mistake that can be made quite a bit.  This is what I thought was implied.  Boy have I been glad that someone came up with lamical.	There were no side effects.  If there were,(which I don't think there were) then they were so minimal as to go unnoticable by me. Some people say they are the type that has all the side effects. I seem to be the one that has none of the side effects.	The treatment has been 200mg/day for three years.
3507	atacand	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	The dizziness subsided, the auras appeared a lot more infrequently	tiredness	After my cardiac procedure, I ended up with high blood pressure because my body was not sure how to deal with the change in my system.  Where the blood was flowing from one atrium to the other was now closed and I was feeling so dizzy I had to look down at the ground to walk.  I couldn't drive. I went to my doctor several times to try and find out what the trouble was.  I monitered my blood pressure several times a day and was put on Atacand which seemed to work well.  However, I found it made me so tired, that I took half a pill in the morning and half at night. Now my body has adjusted a lot, I am only on half the dose I started with. I also take a baby aspirin daily. I rely on Atacand to keep my blood pressure stable.  Once in a while, if I start to feel dizzy or get an aura I take 1/2 a pill of Atacand and sit down for a bit and my symptons soon go away.
1030	vyvanse	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	adhd	I'm a college student and it was hard to focus on school work, i would hardly listen to conversations, my reading skills were awful, i felt like i was just scanning the words and not really comprehending.	dry mouth, i constantly have to drink lots of water, also working out helps with the dry mouth for your info. loss of appetite, i force myself to eat because if i dont i will not eat at all. i notice that since taking the medication i no longer have a sweet tooth. i feel dizzy sometimes too.	Vyvanse really does help me focus on school work and also at work. I'm better in tests and homework problems. I became a better listener in converstations, i do feel happier, not mood swings. I believe i have a better understanding in tasks and i dont feel as hyper as i use to.

594	nitrofurantoin	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	chronic cystitis	When I started using Macrodantin it helped for the releive of bladder infections and also the pain of chronic cystitis. After a few years the side effects became more and the effectiveness of the drug less. I started getting bladder infections more frequently while I was still on the drug.	The drug effected my lungs. I started coughing more. Today I am very sensitive to any products or chemicals,and cough a lot and struggle breathing. I had a skin rush and itching skin. My breast enlarged and lactated. Started getting anxiety.	I had a bladder operation, because of a default of my valves. I was born with the problem. Because of the valves not closing properly I developed a kidney stone. The docters had to remove the stone and I lost my kidney in the proses. After the operations my bladder became very sensitive. The docter prescribed bactroban everytime I got bladder infections. The infections did not go away. I started using Macrodantin. It worked for a few years, but later on I started getting infections even when I was on Macrodantin. The side effects got worse and I had to stop using it.
3901	nexium	8	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux/chronic bronchitis	I found that it did nothing for my acid reflux.  Only after I changed how, what and when I ate did I recieve instant relief from both the acid reflux and the chronic bronchitis.	None	"I was hospitalized for pancreatitis and that's when the coughing started.  The pancreatitis subsided but the coughing worsened, especially at night.  I was diagnosed with acid reflux and ""hyperinflated lungs"", whatever that means.  The coughing would keep me up all night.  I saw both an allergist and a pulmonologist; the allergist prescribed Nexium and the pulmonologist prescribed Advair, the nasal spray with the bee spokesperson, and an inhaler that made me so jittery that I did not sleep for an entire night when I took it.  He also prescribed a codeine syrup that make me incredibly sick to my stomach.  I hated being on all those meds.  I did some research and decided to modify the size and content of my dinner, and eat it earlier in the evening.  No more snacking or ice cream after dinner.  My symptoms immediately stopped.  I took myself off all meds and never went back to those doctors -- I had no need to."
3982	amitiza	3	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	stomach/digestive disorder	I experienced some alleviation to the constipation but it was not ongoing.  It was temporary & it was not regular.  I expected that the treatment would be a cure not jsu a temporary relief.	I felt nauseous & bloated.	I experienced constipation as a side effect to pain meds from surgery.  I did not have previous problems with it.  It never got better even a long time after the surgery.  My doctor recommended I try amitiza after many over the counter products failed.  I used it for 3 months.  I had some relief but it definitely was not a cure.  I quit using the drug since it did not give me significant relief.
3804	cialis	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	erectile dysfunction	Increased confidence, more frequent sex, renewed intimacy with partner.	Blocked sinus, headaches and backpain. Cialis was prescribed to be taken before sex. Because the drug can be effective for up to 36 hours taking another pill even 24 hours later increased the side effects substantially.	The treatment was to take Cialis before expected sexual activity. The timing wasn't essential due to the long lasting effect of the drug.
2521	motrin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	headaches	I suffer with tension and headaches caused by stress. Headaches and tension in my back and shoulders, i find that nurofen is the only drug that will subside them releasing the tension and pain. Nurofen permits me to continue with my work or daily activities.	I suffer from no side effects when using nurofen.	I take 2x200mg tablets or capsules at a time, normally that is enough, if not i take a further 2x200mg dose after 4 hours.

127	valtrex	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	facial herpes simplex	By taking the pills anytime I feel the vaguest possibility that I might be getting a cold sore, I was able to reduce the number of outbreaks. The outbreaks that I do have (if, for example, I don't take the Valtrex in time) seem not as bad as they would be without the Valtrex. The outbreaks seem somehow less... viral. As in, the sores may still form, but the entire process of blistering/opening/scabbing doesn't feel quite as much like my face is a nuclear radiation site.	None	I get horrible outbreaks in the center of my chin-- usually 5-8 sores clustered together all at once; really awful-looking. I'm aware of the things that trigger them, so when I realize there's a chance I might have an outbreak, even if I haven't felt the tingling yet, I'll take a couple of Valtrex and then I don't have an outbreak at all. I can't say for sure that it's the Valtrex stopping it (i.e. maybe I wouldn't have had an outbreak anyway in some cases) but it seems that way to me, and in any case it's nice to have some sense of control over the situation. Even though my outbreaks are awful, they only happen about 2x/year so I haven't felt it necessary to take the daily preventative pills.
3570	differin	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	The treatment easy and convenient and effective for skin turnover to prevent acne.	Differin was drying and particularly the 3% solution.	You are to apply nightly to acne spots but I found it worked better as a preventive measure all over face once your face is used to the drying. Differin worsens any open wounds but is a great preventive measure
3841	voltaren	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bursitis and tennis elbow	I experienced almost immediate relief of both bursitis in my left thigh and tennis elbow in my right aarm.  I also had a strained muscle in lower back area which I also experienced relief from.  The bursitis had been bothering me for quite some time (8mths)and mainly at nighttime when I was lying down in bed.  I found it difficult to get comfortable and often used a hot water bottle to soothe it.	Just after taking the pill (with food) I felt a bit dopey in the head which lasted for up to an hour, and sometimes a slight nausea (but not often).	Take with a large glass of water (i must say I did not notice this instruction until now).  Take 1 tablet daily (with food) when required to relieve pain and inflammation. Swallow whole.  Do not crush or chew.

403	restasis	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	severe dry eyes	After 6 weeks began to reduce the itchy swollen eyes.  Long distance vision gradually cleared and returned to near normal.  After an additional three weeks the itchiness is continuing to reduce and the distance vision is continuing to improve.  Eyes are still itchy but I have gone from putting over-the-counter eye drops in my eyes more than 10x during an eight hour period to about 2x during an eight hour period.  I have improved from barely being able to read the top line of the eye chart to almost normal vision.	Severe burning sensation in eyes about one minute after applying drops.  This burning sensation did not always occur.  When the burning sensation occurred my eyes were photosensitive so I had to remain in a dark room for about 15 minutes.  I wore dark glasses for about one hour after leaving the dark room.  I put the eye drops in my eyes in the morning and before going to bed at night.  This meant some mornings I would be leaving for work at 6am (quite dark out) with dark glasses on as any amount of light was painful.	Had very dry itching eyes.  Difficult to determine if part was allergies.  Was referred to retinal specialist by my eye physician because of severely decreased vision.  Specialist prescribed the restasis and some different eye drops.  Returned in about 6 weeks with distinctly better vision but continued burning and itchy eyes.  Am to continue treatment and return in another six weeks.  Have noticed a reduction in itchiness since last visit and a small improvement in distance vision.
150	zmax	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	std	Was exposed to an STD, this medication got rid of it. Was also taking Cipro to cure a UTI.	Severe diarrhea the first day and moderate the second. Felt nausea and had a hard time keeping food down. Stomach pains and a headache.	Took four 250 mg pills at once, so 1,000 mgs all together. Quite a hefty dose on my stomach but it worked.

Feeling like i drank 2 bottles of vodka! the nausea is unbelievably as well as the head heavyness, lightheadedness, foggy. The doctor told me to finish the medication, but i just cant. it is almost impossible for  me to hold my head up! I will not take this medicine again. it is the 2nd time it was prescribed to me, id rather be sicker for a few more days than deal with the aftermath. and thats saying something!	Awful. thats it.
2407	synthroid	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hypothyroidism	This dosage was supposed to help the thyroid function correctly. However, it appeared to make me more lethargic, even though the blood test showed that it was working correctly. I experienced more benefit from exercise than from taking this mandatory drug.	I experienced weight gain fluctuations and loss of energy. I complained to several doctors over the period of 20 years without effect. There is no alternative treatment if the patient does not feel the benefit. The doctor only sees the blood test to show that the treatment is effective.	No treatment, other than taking a blood test every 6 months to see if the level was correct, regardless of the side effects. I found this offensive since I clearly gained 20 pounds when on the medication than when I was not on the medication (or the dosage was reduced).
1447	cymbalta	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	fibromyalgia	Considerable reduction in muscle pain and increased energy	panic attacks for the first few weeks, followed by mild tachycardia, moderate diarrhea, mild tinnitus	Cymbalta was started at 20 mg for two weeks, then increased to 40 mg.  Dropped again to 20 mg after about a month in hopes of reducing side effects, but 40 mg turned out to be the effective does.
1640	arthrotec	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	arthritis	I had less pain and less stiffness.	After a while the drug was less effective and I needed to take more.  I started with one a day and had to mocve to two and sometiimes three a day.	I went to the dr with pain in joints that started after getting lyme disease.  I have had stomach problems with naprosyn. So he prescribed arthrotec.
3411	aricept	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	head injury/concussion	Easy to take (1 pill before bed), noticably helped me think more clearly, speak better, organize thoughts so I could accomplish small projects.  Before the Aricept, I couldn't sort things (laundry, paperwork, bills), couldn't remember to eat, brush teeth, shower, etc.	"Nausea, gastric problems (diarrhea) and mild headaches. 

I take it at night, so the first 3-4 hours of each morning I experience the above side effects. This is uncomfortable during the first 2-3 weeks, then your body gradually gets used to it."	"Patient: I had suffered a fall from a vasovagal syncope episode (fainted from a standing position, hit back of head on floor).  It was approximately 6 or 7 months before I was prescribed the Aricept.  The Aricept was prescribed to help the brain repair and re-connect (memory, executive reasoning: strategic planning, options, solutions, implementation, changes and follow-through). 

The side effects were worse the first 2-3 weeks on the 5 mg, then the 4th week, my body appeared to adjust and they became less intense. The 5th week, the doctor moved me up to 10 mg, and the side effects increased again. At that point, he took me off the Aricept and tried a competitors ""patch"" called Exelon. That didn't work well at all and set me back 5-6 weeks cognitively. 

Now I'm back on the 5mg of Aricept for the past 2 weeks and the plan is to stay on that dose for 6 months to a year. The side effects were the same at first, and are now getting better each day. I suspect those side effects to subside in the next few weeks. And cognitively - I am improving again each day."

2349	propecia	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	hair loss	In only took the pill for a month, so I do not think it was enough time to see the benefits.	Almost within the first week of taking the medication I noticed a decreased in libido (sexual drive), night time erections were gone, and morning wood was no longer there.	"I read about the drug before using it and I was very hesitant about using it since I heard about all the negative side effects. It didn't seem worth it to take the risk and try it, but I spoke to me Doctor about it. He advised me that if I noticed any of the symptoms, I should stop taking the medicine immediately. I took the chance because I don't want to look back ten (more like two, to be honest)years from now and say, ""Man, I really wish I would have tried it. Maybe it would have worked, I should have at least done my best to fight this monster called baldness."" So I tried it, and I knew almost within the second week that it wasn't for me. I notice all of the side effects and stop taking the medicine. I'm thankful for this website because it gives people the opportunity to be honest and share there experiences. If I had not read some of the comments, I might have continued with the medication and done more damage without knowing it. So thank you. I tried the drug, and realized it wasn't for me. I am very lucky that all of the symptoms have passed and I am back to normal. Funny thing though, here is something I realized, "" I can't get laid without my hair, but if I take this drug, I can have hair but I still can't get laid."" Who says the bug guy up there doesn't have a sense of humor? Good luck everyone."

It took awhile to get off Depakote because I kept having effects from being weaned off it after being on it for 25 years. Then a few months later he started to wean me off of diamox, which I stopped a week ago, after a long process of being weaned off that drug.

3126	cytomel	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroid - hashimoto's disease	Increased energy and memory.  Levothyroxine treatment alone was not working well.  The combination works much better.	None	Since being diagnosed with hypothyroidism, my doctor�s would treat with basically the Levothyroxine.  The levels would be increased until I was �in the range�, but I never felt quite right.  I was still very tired and my memory, especially short-term, was really bad.  I went to a couple endocrinologists, with the first one diagnosing the hypothyroidism as a result of Hashimoto�s disease.  Even with this diagnosis, the first endocrinologist did not suggest other treatments and I continued to suffer with excessive tiredness and memory problems.  I decided to go for a second opinion, and this endocrinologist told me that some individuals react better with a combination treatment of Levothyroxine and Cytomel.  This seemed to turn me around.  The memory and tiredness have gotten better, still not optimal.  It seems as long as one is �in the range�, doctors are hesitant to push the envelope.  I would like to see physicians listen to their patients and adjust the meds until they feel better, not just go �by the range�.

2204	advair-diskus	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	asthmatic bronchitis	I was able to breathe much easier with this inhaler.	As far as I know there were none.	Was given the inhaler due bronchitis.  It seemed effective along with antibiotics.  I am now breathing fine and have no symptoms of asthma or bronchitis.  This was 3 weeks ago.
3306	zoloft	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	panic attacks	"I have debilitating panic attacks. After I was on Zoloft for a couple of weeks I noticed a substantial difference. I no longer felt the ""looming dread"" that comes with a panic attack and I just felt calmer and more in control than before. I was finally able to get my life back and felt more at ease."	I went off of Zoloft on my own in October of 2008. I went down gradually from 50mg to 25 for about a week and then went off completely. The two weeks afterward were a bit crazy. The panic attacks didn't come back but I'd get all emotional at the slightest upset and feel like crying for no reason (which isn't me at all). I also had the strangest, most vivid dreams. I recently went back on the drug after the panic attacks came back and apart from slight dizzyness and diarrhea I'm starting to feel more in control again and less panicky.	My family doctor prescribed it for panic attacks. I saw a psychiatrist years ago but it really didn't do much apart from giving me tips on what to do constructively if I have a panic attack. Which of course didn't help because when you're paralyzed with fear you can't do much of ANYTHING constructive with your time.
1587	xanax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety attacks	It was calming within a very short time.  At the onset of an attack, just having the medicine on hand was calming. It began to work very quickly after taking it.	It made me a little bit too sleepy.  It also was relaxing to the point that I felt a little disoriented.  It was a great solution as long as I was at home.  It would not have been practical to take when working, driving, etc.	It was prescribed to be taken on an as needed basis.  I would take the tablet at the onset of the attack.  The attacks usually occured at night, shortly after I feel asleep.
3318	dilantin	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	seizures	"Dilantin provided Control of seizures
(mostly petits) as these were more frequent.
Generally, the drug is still as effective as when
first introduced to me so there has
been little need for increasing the dosage.
It was imperative in my treatment, though, that the drug be NON GENERIC ONLY."	Dizziness	"Limit stimulants, plenty of rest,

2166	zyrtec	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	allergy	Zyrtec helped to control my runny nose, watery eyes, and sneezing throughout the spring allergy season. It also proved useful as an antihistamine whenever I had similar symptoms after the normal allergy season (March through April).	I did not have any notable side effects during the course of taking the drug.	Take one tablet daily during allergy season.
236	wellbutrin-xl	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Within 3-4 weeks I had no depression and less hyperactivity; I was better able to organize my work and accomplish daily tasks; it regulated my sleep cycle. I told my husband that this must be what 'normal' (non-depressed, non-ADHD) adults feel like.	A small amount of shaking, mainly felt when drinking from a cup. It's not supposed to affect weight and hunger, but I have gained some weight, though I don't know if or how the medicine contributed.	Before using Wellbutrin I had trouble getting to sleep, then trouble getting up in the morning. I was very irritable, depressed and frustrated. I always felt groggy and could not 'get it together' until late in the day. When my treatment began, I started by taking one 150 mg pill first thing in the morning for a week. Then I took one 150 mg pill in am and one 150 mg pill in pm (this was before XL came out). The third week and from then on I took 300 mg in morning. I felt so much better that I was not bothered by the slight let down in the evening. However,I didn't feel really well consistently all day until the XL formula came out. I have tried the generic and I don't feel as well and I had constant stomach aches to the point that I was having pain near my gall bladder and was considering being evaluated for gallstones. All of this cleared up when I went back to Wellbutrin XL and I have not had a problem since.
222	wellbutrin-xl	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Elevation of mood and clarity of thought.  Progress stalled out at 300 mg, but with increase to 450 mg can tell the difference.  I'm able to finally think and plan ahead and chip away at all the clutter I've not been able to deal with which accumulated while depressed.	None at 300 mg.  Possible tinnitus from increase to 450 mg, not evaluated by an audiologist yet though.  Did experience weight loss (7 lbs.) at 450 mg dosage.	Initial treatment included therapy and Lexapro in addition to Wellbutrin XL.  Now only on the Wellbutrin XL.  I see the psychiatrist every 4 months for re-evaluation
3946	prilosec	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	barretts disease	I was actually throwing up a couple of times a week during the night. Found I had Barretts and the treatment cleared up the Barretts after about 5 years.	I have an artifical hip and have constant discomfort where implant was put into femur. I was having quite a bit of back pain and about a year ago started lifting moderate weights about 3 days a week and that seemed to clear up the problem. Sometimes when I overeat or accidently drink a lot of alcohol I get extreme chest pain. I actually break out into a sweat and the pain works from center of my back to front of my chest. After it subsides which is usually 15 to 20 minutes I will be extremely exhaused.The first time it happened I thought I was actually having a heart attack.So to counter the issue I try to eat less at a meal and nibble more often during the day. I still don't know I the moderate discomfort in my leg is the medication, so I guess I will live with it.I have read a bit about the different symptoms and being a little older its hard to determine if its drugs or age causing some of the issues.	I take 20mg everyday before I eat dinner. To me the side effects have been worth it I don't believe I would be here today if I wasn't taking this medication. My dad died of stomach cancer. My brother and sister exhibit the gerd symptoms and are also on the drug now.
2406	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothroidism after radioactive iodine	Medications for the graves disease were not keeping the thyroid levels at a constant state. Had to continually change dosage. The medication for hyperthyroid also can cause birth defects. I was anticipating having children within a few years. I went in and had the radio active iodine. After one month my thyroid was destroyed. Had tried generic brands of synthroid but was still expereincing changes in my thyroid level. My doctor perscribed only name brand syntroid and it has been at a cosistant level for at least 5 years.	When taking synthroid it must be taken on an empty stomach around the same time every day. Multivitamins with Iron decrease the sythroids effectiveness so they must be taken at least 3 hours after taking sythroid. Never miss a dosage. I once missed a few days in a row and became very depressed almost suicidal. Will need to take sythroid for the rest of my life and keep regular appointments to have my thyroid levels checked.	The radio active iodine treatment was conducted as outpatient surgery at the local hospital. I was given a pill to swallow. I was then asked to come back after 6 hours to have a scan done of my thyroid. I came back the next day for another scan. After one week I had a blood test and was perscribed synthroid. I have my thyroid checked on an annual basis. In some cases depending on any changes in my thyroid levels I have had to go back on a six month check up schedule.

120	valtrex	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	chronic cold sores	The first time I took it the cold sore ended up just slightly smaller than they usually are. The second time it was about 1/2 the size. The third time it got red and itchy but it didn't actually blister. The forth time I didn't take the medication because it was only the size of a small pimple. I used to get them about every 4 to 6 weeks but the last one came about 4 months after the previous one.	No side effects at all.	You take 4 pills as soon as you can tell the cold sore is beginning and then 4 pills 12 hours later.
1696	retin-a-micro	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	blackheads,large pores,sun damage	I saw measurable difference in reduction of blackheads and pore size. I was also really happy with the evening of pigmentation. I had sun and age spots as well as freckling and  saw a huge difference in the lightening of all these problems.  My skin had a much better over all tone a seemed to become firmer over time.	The first few weeks of treatment my skin was peeling a little and I had some red splotches but eventually these symptoms went away.	I would wash my face in the evening with a mild cleanser and then every other night when my face was completely dry I would apply a small amount of Retin-A to my face with the exception of the immediate eye area. The evenings that I did not use Retin-A I would use a good night moisturizer.
2650	diclofenac	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	back pain slipped disk	"The Ibuprofen gel would enable instant relief as it could be applied topically and carried around easily in ones pocket/bag.
The Diclomax SR tablets tended to work quite quickly therefore providing quick relief. I also used an ice pack which combined with the other treatments mentioned gave me round the clock relief."	I experienced stomach pains and bleeding when tablets were taken on an empty stomach.  This was the only side effect I experienced and as long as you can be organised about when you eat and take the tablets then it causes no problems at all.  Given the fact I relied on these tablets for 3 years, the side effects were extremely mild and forgettable.	"The treatment was for my back pain, this was lower back pain caused by a slipped disk.  I also received cortisone injections which gave little or no relief.  I was prescribed 3 tablets a day of 75mg dosage to take with meals.
I also had to undertake some back strength exercises in order to strengthen the muscles which had wasted away."
4160	fioricet	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraines	"It effectively stopped migraine at the ""aura"" stage.  No need to take any additional medications."	"Massive dizziness/ ""drugged"" feeling.  A feeling of being ""out of it"" --- unable to focus eyes, exhausted, etc.  Impossible to function until the effect wore off.  Not convinced this is the best option for migraine treatment.  Although it was effective, the side effects were almost not worth it.  There have got to be better options out there."	Every time more than one pill was taken (where one was ineffective in stopping the progression of a migraine), massive dizziness and drugged feeling would result.
2393	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroid	with the treatment I feel less tired and more energetic.I comeback to my normal weight and I stop losing my hair. Also I do not get cold as I use to.	I did not have any side effects after the doctor find the right dosage I was able to function like I used to before I have the symptoms of the hypothyroid.	I take one tablet everyday in the morning in a empty stomach around the same time and I wait an hour before I eat. Sometimes I can only wait 30 minutes and it does not seems to alter the effect of the medication.
3151	prednisone	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	pneumonia	Opened airways to help breath	none. I did have concerns about taking an oral steroid,but was reassured that the short duration would not cause adverse side effects.	After a first round of antibiotics and use of arbuterol with a nebulizer with minimal effectiveness, my doctor put me on an oral steroid to open up my airways. Once I started the seroid, I felt 100% better.
2653	diclofenac	9	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	arthritis	"Anti-inflammatory effect on my joints helped a lot especially my spine.
[NSAID]HELPS RELIEVE PAIN/SWELLING OF ARTHRITIS,SO YOU'RE ABLE TO USE YOU'RE JOINTS MORE EASILY.  THE MISOPROSTOL HELPS PROTECT THE STOMACH FROM UPSET AND ULCERS."	There are a lot of listed side effects but i only had 1 if i had the pill on an empty stomach i would get a nasty pain in the upper tummy.	TABLETS ARE TO BE TAKEN TWICE DAILY FOR AS LONG AS NEEDED.
193	adderall	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	possible add	"The adderall allows me to focus and study better.  I definitely function better while taking it.  I am prescribed to take it ""as needed"" which means that I don't take it everyday.  I tend to take it most school days (med school) and take more of it during testing times.  I am prescribed to take it up to 3 times a day, but I rarely have taken that much."	If I take a 5 mg pill later than 3 pm or so it is difficult to fall asleep.  I sometimes get jittery or feel like my heart is racing.  Sometimes I have strange muscle twitches that I can't control.  Some days it makes me lose my appetite completely, which doesn't sound bad but I'm already a little underweight.	Since I control when I take the meds (what time, how much- up to 3 per day) I think I have over-done it on occasion, even though it was never above what I'm perscribed.  Some days I will take 3 pills so I can truly concentrate, and then can't sleep. . . may have to take a sleeping pill. . . wake up feeling awful and groggy. . . and have to do the whole viscious cycle all over again.  So, even though I'm doing what I'm perscribed to do, it can be too much for me.  I can understand why there is abuse potential with this drug, as you start feeling dependent on it.  Even with all that, the drug has helped me out more than I can ever explain.
2296	lexapro	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression, ptsd	Severe long term depression and anxiety were alleviated.	"Yawning, tiredness, lethargy, dry eyes/sinuses. Over time the drug seemed to build up in my system (the Dr. determined that I metabolize this particular drug slowly)and my dosage had to be adjusted to 5mg/day. 5mg/day takes the edge off the depression but does not cause the extreme exhaustion experienced at higher doses.

This medication is excellent despite some mild side effects. It does not cause any of the musculo/skelatal pain or sleep interuptions I experienced with other anti-depressants."	treatment began 3 years ago, 20mg/day was adusted to 10mg/day taken at bedtime for 2 and a half years. 4 months ago dosage was decreeased to 5mg/day at bedtime.
181	adderall	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	adhd	Ability to focus, not become so disoriented.  Able to think more clearly.	Hard to fall asleep if taken too late in the day.  Affects my skin somewhat (more blemishes, seems to age my skin somewhat)	I take 3 Adderall per day. 1 1/2 pill in the morning, and 1 1/2 in the the afternoon.  Each pill is 15 mg.  I break one in half to divide between morning and afternoon.  I see my doctor once every 3 months to discuss how it's working.  I started out on 5mg, 2x/day, but I developed a tolerance to it over time and went from 5 mg/2x day, to 10mg/2x day to 15mg 2x/day to 15mg 3/day.
3783	keflex	1	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	bladder infections	It did help to control bladder infections.	I was 25 at the time and experienced chronic yeast infections while this drug. About 10 years later I had severe bladder pain, but no infection was present. After bladder biopsy it was determined that I had intercystial cystitis and the doctor feels it was from being on this antibiotic long term. I suffered with this condition for 6 years and finally had DMSO bladder washes which relieved the problem greatly. To this day I have bladder pain occasionally.	After suffering numerous bladder infections, it was determined that I needed longterm antibiotic treatment to get the problem under control. Six months of Keflex. Because this was 25 years ago I am not sure of the dosage.
389	seasonale	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	The benefits of Seasonale is that you only have your period once every three months.	In my situation, I continually have spot bleeding towards the end of every 30 day cycle which should not occur.  My doctor advised that this would lessen the longer I stay on this medication however, it only improved slighty and I never can make it through the entire 90 days, my period always starts a few days before I've finished the last few pills.	You take one pill every day for 90 days, wait 7 days, and then begin the cycle again.
972	periogard	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	dental surgery	prevented infection of surgically sewn gums.  They cut my gums and pulled them down further over the teeth and added a laboratory grown skin product to make the gum larger.  I also used this periogard bottle when they put caps on my teeth, just to prevent infection.	I had no side effects, but was told the product could stain the teeth (which the dentist could alter back to white teeth), however, I wiped my teeth with a wash cloth after swishing with the product.	The details were included in the two above sections.
3506	atacand	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypertension (high blood pressure)	Effectively lowers blood pressure with very few side effects and NO cough, No drowsiness and no sexual problems of any kind!!!	I have had some very mild side effects. Slight nasal congestion (now gone) and an occasional sort of gravelly coarseness to my voice. If they are the only side effects then I am happy to live with that.	"I had been searching for a drug for hypertension that had the fewest side effects. Every time I saw my doctor it was like I was being a guinea pig for the next lot of side effects and it was really getting me down. So after a little research on the net, I came across this drug and reviews from people who have taken it.
I told and showed my doctor the results and he was happy for me to try this drug and I am glad that I did. Previous drugs gave me an instant irritating cough and also made my feet swell up.
This drug is by far the best I have tried so far and just one 8mg tablet a day does the trick for me!"

Tired on the day I took methotrexate
Some nausea"	I am not especially pleased with the weight gain but I have to take something to control the RA.  I guess methotrexate works fairly well.
673	zantac	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	The ranitidine was very effective in releaving my symptoms of acid reflux.  After several months of treatment my stomach, which previously felt nauseated on a daily basis, felt much better and very rarely caused me discomfort.	I didnt seem to have any negative side effects.	I am not sure if it is related to the ranitidine but since I began using it I have not contracted any viruses.  In the past I would get 2 or 3 viruses every year.
3536	lunesta	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	Sleeping was possible.  It works well without making me sleepy the next day like Ambien did.  It also works quickly as long as you lie down right away.	Bad taste in mouth in the morning was bothersome in the beginning but it goes away over time the longer you take the drug.  However, lineage did not work well at all if I ate anything near bed.  The directions say it does not work well with fatty foods.  But, it also did not work if I even took a fish oil supplement, which is a fatty acid.  Even the smallest amount of fat, like a pat of butter on a piece of toast renders it ineffective.  When that happens, I would cut another pill in half and would be able to sleep.  This is a time release drug and should not actually be cut in half!	Taken as needed for insomnia.
4049	amoxil	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	infected site of oreal surgery	The infection that developed at the site of my oral surgery subsided and this allowed the wound to begin to heal.	None observed.	The oral surgeon prescribed amoxicillin as a preventaitive measure after surgery.  I opted not to take a breaod spectrum antibiotic when there was no infection present.  Within 4 days of surgery it was clear that I did have an infection and filled that prescription. I took 500 mg of amoxicillin 3 times daily and took probiotics at least two hours after each dose of antiobiotics to replace the body's good bacteria.  After a few days the infection cleared.  I finished the whole course as directed.

Thirst, very mild chest pain, (lasts for about fifteen seconds).	Low calorie diet, exercise three times a week, one capsule 2 hours after breakfast.

331	androgel	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	male andropause	Extremely better clarity of mind.  Much higher energy.  More strength.  More optimism.  More vigor.	At first I didn't realize that it was significantly converting to DHT and causing typical male pattern hairloss.    Once I realized it was happening, I was able to slow it down greatly via a shampoo designed to block DHT (not systematically, just on the scalp).	Rub gel on forearms twice per day.  Extremely easy.
616	finacea	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acne	I started using Skinoren along with a treatment of benzoil peroxide and alpha hydroxy lotion as part of a regimen to attempt to clear up ongoing, stubborn adult acne. within about five or six days my skin started clearing up.	My skin was already accustomed to high-percentage AHA products, so any stinging scaling or irritation were minimal. After a few days I had no side effects.	Nightly, I would put a small amount of Skinoren, Benzoil Peroxide and an AHA cream (with a 10% AHA)in the palm of my hand and combine, and apply to face nightly. The rest of my regimen included a very gentle face cleanser, and a mild and light moisturizer during the day along with an application of the 10% AHA lotion.

3094	minocycline	1	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	acne	Decreased the number of acne lesions.	"Major Headaches
Neck Pain"	"I have been taking minocycline 100mg twice a day. At first I had no side effects what so ever. However after a week I started heaving headaches and they gradually got worse. It was when I started having neck pains, I stopped using Minocycline. Although I stopped using it, I never thought the pains were due to it - I thought it was from going out right after the shower which I often do. That same night I woke up with hives appearing in my body and towards the end of the day, my face got swollen (eyes and my inner lip.) At first I thought it was a food allergy, went to the doctor and got a full blood test (White blood cells, red cells, cholesterol, sugar, full allergy, almost everything.)

During the waiting period of my results (took about a week and a half) I was taking steroid pills for allergies and I got back to normal within 5 days. On the 8th day, I was like hmm lets take minocycline again, I wanna be proactive and not break out on acne again. I took one pill at night after 8 days of not using it, and the next day I got itchy hands and a few hives and then I realized it was the minocycline that I was reacting to. Luckily I only took one pill and over the counter allergy medicine such as zyrtec got rid off my itchiness and I am back to normal again.



So around 8-9 days later after I gave blood, the results came to my doctor. To my surprise everything came normal no allergies what so ever, no pollen, no nuts, no nuts, no dust completely NO ALLERGIES. My Red Blood cell count along with hematocrit came a little high but nothing else.

I am almost confident to say that minocycline was what I was reacting to and my doctor told me to stop taking it."
266	ultram	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	knee pain	Eased the leg pain.  I had full range of motion in knee.	slight muscle spasms, euphoria	For leg pain from knee surgery.  I really like this medicine.  I know certain people who couldn't take this medicine.  Everyone has different side effects to medicines.  I will continue to take this medicine.  It also gives me a lot of energy, which is good.  I have to get up at 3:30am for work.
3127	cytomel	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	Levoxyl improved lab results, but I still felt tired, had dry skin and some constipation. Adding Cytomel fine tuned treatment and all symptoms resolved.	There were none - all I felt was better.	I took 100 mg Levoxyl, which provides a thyroid hormone called T4. It's success depends on the body's ability to convert T4 to T3; adding Cytomel proves T3 (the active hormone) directly. I now take 10 mcg Cytomel along with 100 mg Levoxyl and symptoms of low thyroid have resolved.

2212	alendronate	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	osteopenia	I have taken this drug for four years, with a hiatus of about 1 year because I was afraid of dire side affects that had been widely advertised, having to do with the deterioration of jaw bone. The alendronate did not seem to stop the slow progression of my osteopenia, as measured by yearly bone density scans. I tried a regular exercise program, using a vibration machine (powerplate) and that stopped the progression of my osteopenia. I stopped the alendronate medication, thinking the exercise was more helpful and I was afraid of side effects.  However, the exercise alone did not work. I have re-started the alendronate medication and am hoping that the combination of the medication and exercise will help.	I have a bad taste in my mouth the day I take the alendronate medication and worry about side-affects, including long-term side affects which are undetectable currently.	I take the medication 1/wk.  I also run or walk daily.
2607	adderall-xr	4	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	add	To treat add.  To releave sudden impulsive behavor.  To help me focus on things that I had to do.  To help me retain information that I was studing in school.  To help me stop putting things off that were important for me to finish.  To help improve my relationships.	I found that some of the side effects were very severe.  I would have compulsive sexual desires that I had never had before and wanted sex with my husband all the time.  I had great difficulty sleeping so I would take melatonin to go to sleep every night.  I would talk very fast as well as move fast.  I would have hand tremers.  I also had very dry mouth and diarrhea.	I woke up every morning a took 1 20mg tab with a full glass of water.  Then, throughout the day I would have to make myself drink water and eat.  I had lost all desire to eat or drink until around 8 or 9pm that day.  I would have obsessive thoughts and couldn't stop working on something until it was finished.  This meant even if I really needed to stop and do something else I couldn't.  I called my doctor and explained this and he switched me to adderall 10mg without extended release.  This has been much better.  However, I still have some obsessive behavor.  I have never been dx or tx for OCD.
3207	levothroid	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	I had felt very tired all the time before I started taking the medication.  Also my skin and hair seemed to be very dry.

225	wellbutrin-xl	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	"This drug definately does have an effect on depression.  I went on a trip and while I had enough for the duration of the trip, I ran out the day I returned and was unable to get the refill for several days.  I noticed a significant change in my mood and affect and began experiencing symptoms of depression again.  Although I tried to keep a ""stiff upper lip"" my husband noticed the change."	"At the beginning of treatment I noticed a slightly elevated heart rate and I felt a bit jittery.  However, I do consume a fairly high amount of caffeine during the day and I was told to expect this by my doctor.  Another effect that I didn't really connect to the medication was a lack of motivation.  I did not attribute this specifically to the medication until I had a conversation with my best friend who had also taken Wellbutrin at one point.  She asked me specifically if I had experienced diminshed motivation while on the drug and it ""clicked"" with me.  I am not entirely certain if this can be attributed solely to the medication since this is also a symptom of depression."	"Overall, I feel that my treatment with this drug has been successful.  I have not experienced any sexual side effects (which I know can occur with some antidepressants).  My libido is exactly the same as it was before my depression and before I began taking this drug.  I know that this drug can also cause a decrease in appetite as well as the urge to smoke.  My husband and I both smoke and I do smoke less when he is not home.  He is not on any medications and so he will frequently ask me if I want to go outside with him and smoke.  Usually (not always) I say yes for the companionship but sometimes I decline.  When he is not home I will smoke approximately 4 cigarettes in an 8-9 hour period (I used to be a pack-a-day smoker).  
Overall, I feel that this is a useful drug for depression.  I began taking it after my father died.  He battled cancer for 3 years and I took care of him the entire time.  His loss was debilitating to me.  No pill is going to change what I went through or how I feel, but this drug has helped me explore some of the painful feelings that go along with his death without ""coming unglued"".  My doctor prescribed this for me and at the same time switched me from Ortho-Tricyclen (which I was highly loyal to) to Loestrin Fe 24.  I must say that between these two drugs, physically I feel ten years younger (I am 33 but I feel 23 again).  Overall I would rate this drug as successful for me and will continue on it as long as my doctor and I feel is appropriate for me."
105	celebrex	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	post shoulder surgery pain	Reduced the pain.	no noticeable side effects.	Started taking right after surgery. I had to subsequent surgeries during the following 5 months. Was taking in conjunction with narcotics right after surgery and for a week or so, then only the Celebrex. After about one year, it was reduced down to once a day. I noticed if I didn't take the medication my shoulder would consistantly ache at about a 3-4 out of 10 pain scale. With the medication, I would rate the pain as 0-1, not really noticeable, but still there.
2426	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	low thyroid production	I had Graves disease in 1990 which indicated that my thyroid function was way too high.  The symptoms were anxiety, sleeplessness, depression and restlessness. I was administered an uptake test and I received radioactive iodine therapy to slow down my thyroid function.  This threw me into a state of low thyroid function.  Synthoid balances my thyroid function to normal and the negative symptoms disappeared.	None	"See my description under ""treatment benefits"""

4123	chantix	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	nicotine addiction	I had smoked for 20 years and despite repeated quit attempts using Zyban (bupropion), nicotine patches (and nicotine gum, lozenges etc), I had never managed to stay quit for long. Chantix enabled me to quit my 10 cigar a day habit with minimal craving and after the first week of treatment I really didn't feel the urge to smoke anymore.	"I was nauseated after taking each tablet. The nausea started about 20 minutes after taking the tablet and lasted for about 30 minutes. I was never physically sick and the nausea was bearable.
I had greatly reduced libido and difficulty getting and sustaining an erection. My orgasm was delayed, diminished and not satisfying. Sexual function returned to normal when I finished the Chantix course.
I had difficulty sleeping and felt fatigued throughout the treatment.
All things considered, the side effects were worth it for the benefits. As smoking causes premature death a few side effects are a reasonable trade off in order to quit."	Standard treatment regime. 0.5mg on day 1, then 0.5mg BD up till day 8, then 1mg BD till 3 months. Gave up smoking on day 10 though smoking had lost most of its appeal by day 7.

2303	lexapro	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	I thought the medication did an okay job.  My anxiety never entirely disappeared, but there was a noticeable reduction.  The medication would probably have been more effective had it been combined with a talking therapy, but it was not.	The treatment had no significant side effects, aside from a little bit of nausea during the initial day or two.  None of the more serious effects listed on the bottle were ever a problem.	Basically, I had anxiety attacks and was prescribed Lexapro.  I took the pill once a day every day for about a year, when I was weaned off.  Apparently, if you don't wean yourself, you can experience withdrawal.

2979	strattera	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	adhd	I am more able to stay on task and finish what I start.   I don't make so many mistakes in the details of my work.  I am more able to concentrate consistantly on a project and not get so easily distracted.  I am more confident that my work will be done well and in a timely manner.	When I first started taking it, I felt odd.  I can't describe it except to say I felt out of sorts.  I had trouble with perspiring and being cold and overly warm.  I would feel cold inside and chilled sometimes and then I'd feel very warm and start to perspire.	I'm taking this because I have trouble with details.  Things like where I parked my car.  I go into the kitchen to get a glass of water and open the refrigerator.  I come out of a business and walk around aimlessly because I have no clue where my car is.  Things are much better now, I rarely have occurrences like this any more.
2502	naprosyn	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis	join pain and swelling	nausea, vomit, gastrointestial disorders	The medicine woks but I still can feel the pain, so for me is not working because of the side effects, I have to take the medicine with food and milk and still have this severe stomach pain, nausea and some times vomits.

1902	doxycycline	8	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	acne with cystic fibrosis genetic condition	"Cleared up my Acne Vulgaris (acne turned into a big boil) and also coincidentally helped manage my lung condition. Usually I take ciprofloxacin 750mg twice a day, two weeks on and two weeks off for my CF, in addition to Azithromycin 250mg every day..BUT when I am off the Cipro i find that my lung condition very gradually deteriorates when I am not on Cipro. My finding was that when I was off the Cipro, and on the Doxycycline, the Doxycycline happen to help ""maintain""or slow down the exacerbation of my lung condition."	YES. Besides being more suceptable to sunburn, being in a tropical climate i felt I was VERY much more suceptable to heat exhaustion symptoms. I overcame this by taking double dosage of Salt tablets, and wearing a wet/cool towel around my neck to prevent the sun exposure on back of my neck. Wore a hat at all times also.	Doxycycline 100mg twice a day, after meals, with no milk for 1 mour before or after. To helpe with side effects I took 16-22 salt tablets per day (being in a tropical climate) plus panadol 2 tablets twice a day after meals. I found the panadol helped manage the symptoms of vertigo (mild dizzyness). I felt the panadol in low dosages also helped me recover quicker from excercise.
1766	prochlorperazine	2	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	nausea	i was experiencing nausea without vomiting. The doctor prescribed stemetil 3x daily.  The first day the nausea was largely alleviated by the taking the stemetil.	The second day of taking stemetil i began to experience unpleasant anxiety and a  cramping sensation in my muscles, particularly my arms. This worsened throughout the day and I found myself uncontrollably flexing my muscles and not being able to control it.	My GP prescribed stemetil for the nausea associated with a migraine. 5 mg x 3 a day. After experiencing the symptoms as described above, I returned to the Doctor.  He injected me with something? which counteracted the uncontrollable cramping I was experiencing.
1937	lac-hydrin	5	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	extremely dry skin	It was helpful in reducing the severity on my life-long extremely dry, flaky, itchy skin. It was recommended that I be certain to apply it directly after a shower, when the skin still retains some of it's moisture from the shower itself. This is true for all lotions, but seemed particularly helpful with the Lac-hydrin. Unfortunately, though it was more helpful than many lotions I've used, the benefits did not warrant the higher price of the product. Ultimately, I've found BETTER results with the much cheaper Eucerin and even Curel moisturizing lines.	During the 6 months during which I used the Lac-hydrin, I didn't experience any negative side-effects. I was using it during winter months, so I don't have any feedback to offer on sun-sensitivity. I didn't experience any additional skin irritation that lessened my interest in the product. I simply moved on to other products because of the price.	The Lac-hydrin was applied topically to all parts of my body (expect my face) twice daily. My dermatologist recommended that one of the applications be directly after my shower. The skin will retain moisture from the shower for a bit, and the application of the Lac-hydrin will help to keep it there. I would reapply to dry skin again before bed.

3399	proscar	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hair loss	Hair loss was abated and some regrowth occurred but not on the crown area. Also hair thickness and strength appeared better.	Some sexual side effect was noted after taking the drug for one year. In particular a loss of ejaculate volume.	After one year reduced the doseage by 25% per day and noticed some lessening in side effects.
3557	vytorin	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	high cholesterol	None.  My LDL level did not drop.	My ck levels jumped to 480, bruising without trauma, loss of memory, lapses of time up to 4 hours, significant pain in legs which kept me awake at night, made my legs jump.  My left leg contorted during a spasm, my foot turned out which couldn't be straigntened without help and masssge of the calf and foot.	"Cholesterol levels are high with genetic factors.  LDL  170, HDL 80, total 276.  The cardiologist used Vytorin as first and only treatment.  My diet contained <20% fat intake, almost no saturated fat.  I had pain in my legs within weeks, informed the doctor who checked my ck levels.  Lab showed ""within normal range"" and I was told to resume the vytorin.  Within 3 weeks the pain was unmanagable, so I called the doctor again.  The nurse said I had to put up with a little discomfort but I insisted on another lab.  Lab resulted in ck levels of 480, I was told to stop the vytorin and drink a lot of water.  I changed cardiologist at that time."
2886	avita	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	skin aging/sun damage	Within 4 days my skin became visibly smoother, pore size was markedly reduced very quickly and after just a few weeks there was increased firmness and generally younger looking skin. Crows feet and forehead lines also diminshed. Skin strength was greatly improved and I did not need to where make-up to hide imperfections as much, my skin looked more polished.	None	A dermatologist prescribed Retinova and told me that the longer I used it, the better the results would be. This proved to be correct. He told me to mix a pea sized portion with my usual moisturiser but to only use it once a day, I used it at night. He also stipulated that it was very important to use an effective sun block as Retinova increased sensitivity to sunlight. A number of people commented on the improvement in my skin. After about 12 months a large, brown patch of sun damage on my temple flaked off and didn't come back. I was very disappointed when I went to get my usual 3 month prescription and was told that Retinova was no longer available. I have subsequently used Retin-A but without the same visible results. This wasn't prescribed by the original dermaltologist, he didn't believe Retin-A was suitable for what I wanted to achieve for my skin. Over the counter products containing retinol do help smoothness a little, but nothing compared to the dramatic changes I experienced when I used Retinova. What amazed me the most was how quickly some of the changes occurred, within only a matter of days.
2362	propecia	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hairloss	With using generic finasteride there's no doubt that further hairloss has been prevented in my case.  Before beginning on this, my hairloss was rapidly escalating, both at the front and back, and this ceased and slightly reversed once started, and hasn't progressed since.	Definitely loss of libido, tiredness, some fogginess of thought, loss of muscle tone, occasional testicular pain, lowered blood pressure, increased floaters in vision, some gynecomastia when cycling down (minimised by taking Zinc on those days, but I would say not to discontinue this medication suddenly if taking a break or quitting).	Mostly generic Proscar - 5mg tablets cut into six equal pieces - 4 days on and one day off in a continuing cycle.
2233	allegra	6	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergies	Less sneezing, headaches, and stuffy noses.	Sometimes, extreme drowsiness.	Other than making me drowsy, this stuff is great, while it works.  The problem I'm having is that I'm only allowed one pill per day and that pill wears off after 12 hours EVERY DAY.  Then, I'm back to being miserable, again. :(
1699	retin-a-micro	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	"I started using Retin-A after the birth of my second child when I broke out with
adult acne.  At the time it was not advertised as an anti aging cream and as I was only 26 or so I really wasn't concerned about wrinkles. Because of the warning of photosensitivity increase to sun exposure I used sunscreen daily (I lived in Tampa,FL). Now at the age of 62 I have gorgeous skin. Yes, I LOVE products but my basic regimen has not changed. Cleansing,Sunscreen and Retinol-A
at bedtime. I had been on HRT for 10 years  so that should be factored in to the equation."	The humidity in Florida helped so much in building up tolerance for the drying effect of Retin-A. I had to be extremely careful NOT to introduce any other strong product AHA or Gylgolic Acid and washing once daily with mild cleanser (Cetaphil). Once Retin-A Micro was introduced to the public I switched and I literally can smear it everywhere around my nose and lips and close to my eyes with no problem. However I do not use Retin A in cold dry climates or on vacations because of the changes in atmosphere and environment.	"Nightly use pea size amount. Wait 20 minutes after exposure to water (cleansing)
so that skin is completely dry."
284	xyrem	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	After suffering with chronic insomnia for the majority of my adult life, and after all of the popular sleep meds failed, I found Xyrem and it has changed my life. I am now in control of when I go to sleep and when I wake. The depression (Beck Index: 28) vanished after 3 weeks of treatment (Beck Index: 5). Anxiety has also abated. Loss of fat, increase in muscle size and strength. Improved energy. Improved interaction with friends and family.	During the first 2 weeks there was stomach irritation, increased sweating at night, and diminished appetite.  All have abated now.	"I take 3.25g at bedtime, usually 10:30 PM.  This normally produces sleep until about 2:00 AM. I then take another 2.75g dose and sleep until 5:30 AM.  On average, I get 5.5 to 7 hours of sleep and it is the best sleep I have ever known.  I no longer stay awake for days on end and I never have to come home on my lunch break to nap.  

With the exception of the outrageous price, Xyrem is an amazing treatment for insomnia.  It is a shame that the media has turned such a wonderful treatment into an evil 'date rape drug'."
1670	vioxx	3	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	possible arthritis	Don't believe that I took it long enough to really tell if it was working. I had an allergic reaction shortly after I started taking it.	"My upper lip swelled up an became rough an mildly itchy. It remained rough and swollen for a week. For another week it just felt ""weird"". There was some  crustiness around my mouth. Hadn't eaten or taken anything else orally that was new to me."	I don't remember the details, but I did follow the prescription directions to the letter. Did not take more than was prescribed to me and took it in the prescribed manner.
924	paxil	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	anxiety	Totally reduced anxiety around presenting information to groups.  Made it possible to think clearly and give an effective class.	Dopey feeling, extreme fatique, procrastination, numb feeling.	"My MD perscribed the medication for some increasingly intense feelings of anxiety around presenting to certain groups of people in higher levels of management.  I was hoping for something that I could take only on a ""as needed"" basis as I've never been one to take medication unless absolutely needed.  My MD does not believe in prescribing that kind of medication due to the highly addictive nature. I do not like the side effects of this drug and do not intend to continue it."
1443	tirosint	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypothyroidsm	Greater energy, almost twice as much faster recovery from excercises and workouts. Much reduced muscle and joint pain compared to pre treatment, losing some weight, appetite control and feeling satisfied with less food. Less junk food cravings.

1823	yasmin	4	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control	I PREVENTED PREGNANCY	DEPRESSION, IRRITABILITY, WEIGHT GAIN, SKIN SPOTS.	I HAD TO TAKE BIRTH CONTROL PILL EVERY DAY AT THE SAME TIME FOR 3 WEEKS AND BE OFF FOR ONE WEEK. START A NEW PACK OF PILLS ON THE FOUR WEEK AFTER MY PERIOD.
3299	zoloft	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	I have seen a great improvement since taking Zoloft.  I am a classic type A person and tend toward anxiety when I have alot going on in my personal and professional life.  I asked my physician about Zoloft when my second child was 2 years old and I was under alot of stress at work.  I sleep much better, am more even tempered, and more optimistic when taking Zoloft.  Another benefit, probably due to my anxiety being under control, is that I think more clearly.  I don't become distracted as easily and find it easier to stay focused on projects at work.	I need to take my dose with breakfast.  If not, I feel nauseous.  This hasn't been a huge issue, since I eat breakfast regularly.  However, if I take a pill and eat immediately, I feel sick to my stomach.  The only other issue I have had is that I feel dizzy if I miss a dose.  I am good at remembering to take my morning dose, so this does not happen often.   Also, I did go off Zoloft a couple of years ago because I wanted to reduce the number of drugs I was taking.  Although I gradually reduced my dosage, I had a difficult time when I finally went completely off.  I felt dizzy and suffered a couple of bouts of vertigo.	I take 75 mg in the morning.  Zoloft was prescribed to me by a family practice physician when I was 41 years old. The first 18 months that I took Zoloft, my dosage was 100 mg.  I took a break for about 2 years and asked my physician abbout going back on Zoloft last year, when I turned 45.  I was experiencing mood swings right before my period and, in doing research on the internet, learned that this could be due to my age.  One recommendation was treating the symptoms with zoloft or another prescription drug.  My physcian started me on 50 mg, and I went up to 75 mg after a few months of taking Zoloft.
2405	synthroid	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	s/p thyroidectomy	Treatment benefits consisted of weight gain after pronounced weight loss due to thyroid tumor.  Although the patient felt that there was a greater weight gain than she desired.	A greater than desired weight gain and a decrease in energy and libido are the most bothersome side effects as per the patient.  The dose is still being titrated in order to moderate these effects.	Post thyroidectomy, the patient was placed on Levothyroxin 120 mcg, but the patient complained of pronounced weight, lack of energy, lack of sex drive and some depression.  Blood work was done and the dose has been adjusted to 100 mcg and will be re-evalutated in 2 months.
2367	propecia	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hair loss	Hair loss almost stopped, although minor loss continued.	A difficulty in concentration, or 'mind fog', reduced visual acuity, fatigue, and an increased libido, which I didn't realise was due to the drug until I stopped taking it after 5 years. Symptoms disappeared after stopping the drug.	I took Propecia (Finasteride) for 5 years, and then stopped. I started taking the drug again recently because my hair loss greatly accelerated after stopping the initial treatment, however, the adverse symptoms returned immediately, and so I again stopped taking the drug.
4143	percocet	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	pancreatitis	Due to unresponsiveness to acetaminophen and negative side effects from aspirin and ibuprofen, I was given a prescription to Percocet.  This did a wonderful job reliving the pain.  I now live a pain free life.	Unfortunately one of the side effects is pretty bad constipation.  Also mild drowsiness	one 5 mg in the morning and one at night

1412	adipex-p	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	weight loss	I lost ten pounds in the first month.  I was given 90 more days....and doing well.	"I woke up at 3:30 a.m. for about a week, but that is back to normal.
I had a lot of energy.
Crave water, which isn't really a bad thing.
The bottoms of my feet itched for about 3 days."	I am needing to lose 60 pounds.  Had been struggling to lose for 5 years. My sister lost 75 using Adipex, and I went to her doctor to try it.  I love it so far. My clothes are fitting looser.  I exercise regularly and eat less.  I do not feel hungry or crave sweets like before.  I can't wait to see another 3 months.
3980	norvasc	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hypertension	On amlodipine 5mg, controlled BP but ocassional spikes of HTN when dose should have controlled all day, doctor prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 25mg as well in response.	Very sleepy after taking, also my feet and ankles swelled very badly.	Doctor told me it appeared I was getting very dehydraded, my electrolytes were depleted.  I will get a full fasting lab in a few weeks.  In the meantime, was told to take a sports drink once daily and take the hydrochlorothiazide to see if that helps with the edema and controls the spikes of HTN.
167	zomig	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	I usually wake up in the middle of the night with a migraine.  I take a Zomig immediately and usually within an hour the pain is gone.  I've been taking Zomig for over a decade and won't go anywhere without them.	The side effects were not that bad at all.  I'm a bit tired but nothing I would complain about.  When the headache pain is gone, a little bit of tiredness is nothing to me.	I suffered with migraines since I've been 22 years old and now I'm 59. No matter what medication I tried, it never took the pain away. A little over 10 years ago, I had a severe migraine while I was at an Acupunturist for a back treatment and asked him if he could do anything for my migraine and after giving him more information he came to the conclusion that my migraines are hormone related and he couldn't help.  He gave me a sample of Zomig and told me to try it and IT WORKED!!!  I was in awe and called him immediately to thank him for introducing me to this drug.  I've been taking it since.
2482	enbrel	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	psoriasis	After having a severe outbreak of psoriasis Enbrel was the only one that cleared it up in about a month. been on medication almost three years and still have some psoriasis flare ups but not as bad as it was before. Maybe caused more due to stress. Also joint swelling and pain in my legs have gone away still feel fatigued sometimes but common with the disease.	Some bruising to the site of injections but doctors monitor it every three months and blood work comes back normal to good.	I get treated for psoriasis and psoriatic artheritis. I take sure click injection myself once a week 50 mg.
2286	lexapro	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I felt more stable in my daily activities; more capable of handling stress; and better able to successfully complete my daily responsibilities of working nights, parenting three children and keeping a house running at an acceptable level.	While I was taking the medicine, I slept alot during the day.  It could have been a side effect of my depression; however, I felt it was from the Lexapro because it was more extreme in the beginning of my takning this medicine and subsided somewhat after the medicine had been in my system for a while.  No matter how much I slept, I never felt rested and could still sleep a full night also.  This could also be attributed to my working night shift; however, once I quit taking the Lexapro, the need to sleep so much during the day subsided.	I was prescribed 10mg initially and this was not enough so my dose was increased to 15mg.  I would occasionally take an additional 5 mg, totalling 20mg, but this was rare.  I eventually weaned myself off of the medicine.  My doctor said that it would be acceptable for me to do this myself as I felt ready; largely because my father had died and my mother had remarried and we both felt it was going to be a temporary need only.  I took Lexapro for approximately 6-8 months.

12	nasonex	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	allergies	Using Nasonex improved my sneezing, runny nose and stuffiness from year round allergies.  I no longer had to carry tissues with me everywhere I went.  My sleep improved and I was more alert at work.	I did suffer from more sore throats, headaches and nose bleeds while I was using the medication.  These were not too severe.  I stopped using it when it stopped working as well and began using Singular.	I used Nasonex for 3 years to treat my year round allergies.  It was very effective but did have side effects. After 3 years, it stopped being effective.
1557	methotrexate	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis	Methotrexate kept the RA from progressing rapidly. Pain, swelling and stiffness were noticeably less when taking medication. It did not stop RA progress completely. In addition, arthritis nodules did develop.	Had to get monthly blood tests to check liver and kidney function. Once, after about 3-4 years of usage I had an abnormal blood test and was told to stop taking methotrexate for a month, then re-take blood test. Upon normal test, went back to taking methotrexate as usual. Did not notice any effects during time of abnormal blood test.	Injected myself in the thigh once a week.
619	finacea	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	rosacea	Facial redness decreased within the first month. Facial flushing was decreased.	During the first month I experienced stinging and itching for around 10 minutes after application. This lessened in severity after the first week, and tapered off completely after about a month.	I applied Finacea to my facial skin twice a day after cleansing. My main aim was to decrease the redness caused by Rosacea. This was successfully achieved, my skin seemed paler and less reactive to my Rosacea triggers (which include sunlight exposure and spicy foods).
1098	effexor	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Yes would recommend this drug for people with mild depression,	Tired.......... I work a lot of hours! but I felt overly tired during the day. Once I came off of the medication,the tiredness went away.	1 pill every night for depression.My doctor wanted me to try different medication,as my depression comes and goes.
90	pristiq	2	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	stress-related anxiety	"A feeling of relaxed euphoria; i.e., not worrying about anything and feeling slightly ""buzzed"""	Rushing sound in temples, along with intermittent headache twinges in the temple area; tightness/spasms in the jaw and throat area; impaired ability to focus; when combined with caffiene from one cup of coffee, resulted in racing pulse for several hours until the drug wore off	Dr. advised me to start with half the recommended dosage (25 mg of 50 mg, or half a pill 1x/day) and work up to 50 mg/day.  After taking one dosage (25 mg) and experiencing the side effects, I notified the Dr. and stopped taking the medication.  One dose of 25 mg. taken at noon lasted until noon the following day (24 hours).
614	innofem	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hormone replacement	Some decrease in headahces.  However, now all these years later taking estradiol, I look younger than my friends and my skin is in much better condition.  I'm not wrinkle free, but have fewer than most women my age who have not had hormone therapy.	None really	I was experiencing hot flashes, mood swings and headaches before taking estradiol.  Since taking it, the flashes and mood swings disappeared.  I have been on hormaone therapy for about 20 years and have no intention of going off.  I feel good and look good for my age and I attribute some of that to the hormonal therapy.
3820	penicillin-v	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	strep throat	The treatment effectively got rid of my infection and also alleviated my pain after taking twice(on day).	The only side effects were I felt a little sick if I took the pill on an empty stomach and I got diarrhea a couple of times	After seeing my doctor I was prescribed Penicillin V and took it for ten days twice a day.
1414	adipex-p	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	weight loss	Considerable weight loss, increased energy, decreased appetite,	increased heart rate, jittery, hyperactivity, severe diet change	Taken to complement daily exercise and healthy eating, phentermine produced significant weight loss.  It was effective throughout the months, though it lessened over time. The heart rate issues and jitters were felt mostly during the beginning of the treatment.
861	valium	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	"After intolerable side effects of an anti depressant it relaxed my stomach (stopped vomiting) relaxed muscles so constant shaking and shivering subsided,helped me sleep and for me to actually have normal and relaxed thoughts.

Taken when needed from normal anxiety it just relaxes body and mind... it's long lasting nature often means that"	"Slight mental and phyical sedation (positive effect for me but be careful if you need to be alert e.g driving)

Slight mental fog for couple of hours on a higher dose (i wouldn't choose this particular benzodiazepine if I felt anxiety at work as I wouldn't be able to concentrate up to the standard required.) But perfect for every other situation."	"It's long lasting nature often means that if I am experiencing anxiety only one dose is enough to last through the night into the next day... and often it seems as though the body remembers and stores this relaxation so another dose is not necessary. 

I only take when needed which can mean I go months without a dose... this is important as for me personally if I see valium and other benzodiazepine drugs as a long term / life treatment its vital not to become addicted and dependant as this not only means needing a drug to function (shackled by a drug rather than using its benefits when really needed.)

But if your body has constant daily dosing for months or years your brain stopped producing natural relaxation chemicals meaning that you need more and more of the drug to get the same benefit and also because of this after years of high dosage extreme withdrawal symptoms can occur while the brain starts to produce these chemicals again."
3466	ambien-cr	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	more restful sleep. which helped me to be more alert during the day and less nervous and paniky thinking about my inability to sleep at night knowing I had to work the next day.	slight groginess the first couple of days but other than that I actually felt more awaken because the sleep I received was deeper and allowed for me to be more restful when I awoke.	1 tab at night when needed one hour before bedtime.
3881	abilify	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bipolar	I had severe depression with agitation and mixed-state bipolar hypomania. I was insomniac. I took abilify 5mg for 3 mos, and then I upped it to 10mg.	I became drowsy, however, with adequate sleep (10 hrs) there were no hangover effects, unlike zyprexa, for instance. I also experienced some cognitive blunting- that is to say that I could not think very well on my feet	the abilify decreased the need for daily klonopin. When I went off of it, I tapered down to 5mg for 4 weeks, then quit altogether. I had racing thoughts when I stopped, but these gradually diminished over several weeks. I also experienced about two months of hypomania, but this was goal-directed and positive for my functioning.
781	naproxen	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	carpal tunnel	releved pain for 1 hour but then has no more effect and caused pain not reileif possibly ebcause of `the fast i had high blood pr1essure but did not read it has high sodium, (low sodium diet for over 3 years)	gave me extreme cramps, swelling, dizzyness, nausiea, laughing for 30 minutes straght	????

1998	vicodin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	pain relief - toothache	"Acute pain in tooth subsided normally within 30 minutes, and the relief lasted 6-8 hours.  Allowed me to sleep the entire night without being awakened by the return of pain.

I was later prescribed Codeine after the procedure, which only dulled the pain to half intensity."	"Mild drowsiness accompanied by a sense of well-being or euphoria.  Side effects were enjoyable, so I was especially careful to take it only as needed to reduce risk of dependency.  The combined effect of pain relief and ""nice feelings"" make this a risky drug to take if you are susceptible to addiction."	"Prescribed by my dentist to ease pain until I could have a problematic wisdom tooth extracted.  Received 30 tablets to be taken as needed for pain.  I took a half tablet when the pain was less severe and a whole one when I thought pain might interrupt sleep.

My back went out suddenly one day and I was unable to stand or walk without excruciating pain.  I took the last two Vicodin in one dose and the moment I was able, went to a clinic where the doctor chastized me for having a narcotic.  The onset of pain relief was rapid, the side effects took longer to present, but when they did, they were more marked.  Same amount of drowsiness, heavy limbs, and a trance-like state."
2365	propecia	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	male pattern baldness	It effectively slowed my hair loss dramatically. My barber of 15 years says my hair has not changed. I notice slight loss over the years, but I still have a lot of hair whereas I would most certainly be bald without it!	None	The cost is prohibitive for many. I took Propecia for many years (with great results) until I went to a new doctor and he offered to prescribe it's generic counterpart Finasteride. It costs about $30 for a six months supply compared to Propecia @ $85 for a one month supply. The only drawback is that the pill only comes in 5mg, so you have to cut it into 5 doses of 1mg. For that kind of savings it was no problem for me and it's been working for me for about 5 years! If your doctor won't do it, fire him/her as they are probably on the payroll of big pharma!
3269	zoloft	10	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	anxiety	Completely eliminated anxiety disorder characterized by panic attacks and generalized anxiety after dosage of 50 mg/day was taken.  Downsside was that while on 25 mg/day start up dose for the first  7 days anxiety was extremely worsened and almost unbearable.	Initial weight loss	Patient taking 50 mg/day for generalized anxiety disorder and panic attacks.  Initial start up dose 25 mg/day for 7 days.   Anxiety extremely heightened and patient almost disscontinued med because of it.  Hung in there and pill started to decrease and finally eliminate anxiety.
3713	lamictal	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar ii	My head felt very clear for the first time in years. I didn't get rattled as easily. Mood stabilizer is a very good description of it. I was able to get motivated, and not feel the world was ending every time something went wrong. I lost the desire to spend money in a ridiculous fashion.	Unfortunately I developed the much feared rash, and had to discontinue. I had recently started Cymbalta, so I can't be sure it was the Lamictal that set me off, but the psychiatrist didn't want to risk it. I did have to change the timing of the dose to bedtime, as it made me a bit tired shortly after I took it. Also, I believe it affected my vision, which got a bit blurry sometimes.	I spent years shuttling between SSRI's, which I know know were the key element in tipping me into mania several times. After the psychiatrist determined the problem was BiPolar 2, the first treatment she considered was Lamictal. I did get some headaches at first, and unfortunately, at some point the effects were negated by the addition of Adderal. Once the Adderal was stopped, it was all good again. I would recommend this drug to anyone, with the proviso that if the SJS rash shows up, you must stop it immediately. Despite that, I really feel it is worth trying.
3988	fosamax	5	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	osteroporosis	there were none that I know. Still has osteroposis.  Had to stop because of the stomacjh effect.	Developed atrial fibrillation of the heart.  going to shock heart into proper rhythm.  Looked down her throat with a camera to see if there was any blood clots around her heart.  Ruptured her esophagus.  Never did find out what caused this but i figure the fosamax caused a very very small hole in the esophagus, weakened the side and the camera scope tore a hole. When fixed, there was no more pain in the stomach.  She is alright now--but almost died from this	See above for treatment details as I don't know what more I could say.  She is healthy now from this.  Fosamax and this type of drugs are not very good for some people.
28	alprazolam	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	Anxiety greatly diminished shortly after taking alprazolam.  The alprazolam was also effective in calming the mind prior to sleep.  I have taken alprazolam for anxiety attacks, worrisome and obsessive thinking and in order to fall asleep.	I noticed no adverse side effects other than an occassional grogginess the next day after taking it at night.	The Doctor prescribed alprazolam for anxiety, taken daily every 8 hours or as needed to treat immediate symptoms.
1533	levitra	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	ed	The stuff works like a charm--fast and effective.	None	One pill 30 mins. before activity
1072	morphine	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	for tramflap surgery,implant removal	none	I went into shock during recovery from surgery and was told I had allergic reaction to the morphine and not to ever take it again.  I saw red spiders and hallucinated for weeks afterwards.	Not sure of any details, since it was during surgery and I was not awake.
3297	zoloft	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	ibs, panic attacks, depression	Panic attacks and depression completely alleviated; true 'happy pills'. I wish I could keep on taking them indefinitely as I am in a life situation which can't be readily changed in the foreseeable future, where I am unhappy and stressed, which can and does lead to depression and negative, sometimes suicidal, thoughts. I found Sertraline completely ineffective for my IBS.	After taking drug for 4 months I developed (for want of a better description) 'muscle jumps' (more severe than twitches and different from tics) which could occur in any part of my body, causing a literal 'jump' in the affected body part!  These only occurred when I lay down - usually when I was in bed, but didn't occur when I was up and about moving around.	I gave up taking Sertraline completely on my own volition as the condition was getting worse and although more irritating than serious, it started to interfere with my sleep.  The condition took around 2 months to completely disappear.
1922	zithromax	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinusitis	It is extremely, powerful antibiotic, which give immediate effect with in two hours.	nausea	500 mg of azithromycin once in a day...for three days gives total recovery from sinusitis.
2551	dexedrine	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	adhd	ability to concentrate and order thoughts, capacity to work effectively, organise home life, I was able to start tertiary study again and complete assignments and exams where I wasn't able to before due to concentration and motivation issues caused by my condition	clenching of jaw, loss of appetite at first, senses felt a bit strained at the end of the day, at times I felt a bit overwhelmed and heart would beat pretty fast - this was at least in part due to the medication,	ongoing treatment for ADHD, originally I was prescribed 40 mg per day but dropped it to 30 mg when I had a few instances of heart palpitations and panic attacks
74	flexeril	6	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	upper back / left shoulder and neck pain	Not sure if it is effective or not.  Pain is gone in the morning but steadily increases as the day progresses.  I am virtually unable to function by evening.  I think I may ask my physician to prescribe an additional 5mg to be taken in the afternoon to see if that prevents the pain rebound in the afternoon.	Slight grogginess in the AM.	Starting PT in 2 days.  Currently on Flexeril QD HS x 5 days.
517	lidocaine	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	nerve and muscle pain	Almost immediate (i.e. within 15 minutes) relieve of severe nerve and/or muscle pain in neck, shoulder &/or lower back. These patches work like a miracle for me, although others who have used them say they offered no relief for muscle or nerve or shingles pain.  I have bone spurs in my neck which sometimes irritate the nerves in my neck and cause excrutiating pain ... also periodic sciatica and shoulder and upper & lower pack pain from an auto accident.  Chiropractic and message helps, but these patches are used when those interventions fail to bring about sufficient relief ... especially for the nerve pain in my neck. I use them only as a last resort.	Relief of pain!  No bad side effects.	Although the packaging indicates that up to 3 Lidoderm patches can be used at one time for up to 12 hours in a 24 hour period, I have never used more then two patches, and then only rarely.  I usually use one patch and cut it into several pieces to fit specific areas. I have used one patch, cut into 2 pieces on my neck for up to 24 hours several times (i.e. replaced the first patch with a second at the end of a 12 hour period) during severe pain episodes, without any harmful side effects.
1317	prevacid	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	severe heartburn	Overall acid reduction; however, it could be sporadic.  With taking the medication, still had to watch diet and avoid triggering foods.  At times, the medication was not effective.	None	Symptoms were so severe they would wake me up in the middle of the night, gasping for breath at times.  This treatment reduced episodes such as this, but was not 100% effective at all times.
3160	prednisone	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	polymyalgia	I went from being in extreme pain and sometimes almost immobile to being able to go back to work at a physical job	So far all I,ve had is a little weight gain plus occasionally I have to take ib prophen in the evening to get rid of leg pain	i sarted off with taking 3 - 5mg pills a day, over some moths I was down to 1 - 5mg pill a day.  I went off the medication a few days and was ok until the third day.  I went bace to taking 3 pills a day for a week, am now down to 2 a day and will go down to one a day next week. I then will bee taking 1 pill every two days.  The trick is to take as little as possible while not taking too little and having to start over again
2623	depo-provera	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	birth control	I was taking this drug as birth control, and it has been extremely effective.  (No children, yet!) The fact that you only need to take it four times a year is great, so it is difficult to miss a dose. (Unlike the pill, which you take everyday, and missing it even once alters it's effectiveness.)  As an added bonus, I no longer have my period, which were extremely painful and disrupted my life for a whole week every month.  I no longer suffer from PMS symptoms, either.  I can not complain about this drug at all.	I have not experienced any side effects from this medication.  Losing my period was an anticipated side effect, and although many feel that this is too much for them and discontinue use of this drug, it is a good side effect for me.  Also there are studies that show bone mineral density is affected by this drug, but I have undergone a bone density scan, with normal results.  This is great, considering I have been on Depo for nine years now, since I turned nineteen and for most of my twenties.	This drug is administered into a muscle by injection four times a year, by a physician.  The shot is given every ten to thirteen weeks.  Besides being used as birth control, it is also used to treat other conditions.
2240	allegra	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	significantly helped in reducing congestion and headaches. Incidence of illiness and or secondary sinus infections were reduced.	None. I felt much better taking the medicine	"After taking allergy tests and having significant response to dust mite allergins and mold, the doctor prescribe some antihistimines. I took several different kinds which had either no effect or made me feel extremely drowsy. 
Trying the allegra helped immediately and I felt fine. It has worked well for me over the years and continues to."
2014	triaz	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acne	My acne has been greatly reduced and my skin is a lot clearer. I also found that my skin is less oily. I saw these results within the first month of using the product.	I haven't experienced any side effects.	I washed my face with the Oxy wash morning and night leaving the Oxy wash on my face for 3-5 minutes and then I rinsed the Oxy wash off.
2170	zyrtec	6	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	year round allergies	I have good relief of sneezing, dripping nose, chesty cough, dry throat until a couple of months ago	have been on citirizine for approximately 7 years if not more.  I saw my GP last week to change as the cetirizine was no longer working on my allergies.  Since then I have slept only for about 12 hours (in six days), a nauseous feeling in my stomach with dizziness, stomach cramps, a permanent knot in my stomach, shivers, tremors and sweats, I am worried about itching starting  now.  The good news is that I am less fuzzy in my head even though I am tired, my bladder control is back and I seem to be losing some of the 3/4 stones I have gained since taking the drug.  Today I took half a tablet just to function in my job	I was prescribed one tablet daily along with eye drops and a nasal spray, over seven years ago.
1595	xanax	1	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety attacks	At first I loved this drug. Panic attacks were getting under control and I didn't feel druggy or fuzzy headed.	There were no side effects that I noticed at the time.	Sadly, you can't (or shouldn't) take a drug like Xanax forever. So eventually, after using it for four months, I stopped. OMG. Would someone please explain to me whose brilliant idea it was to create a drug that when you stop taking it, causes the same symptoms that it was designed to alleviate to begin with?!?! I ended up going through even worse panic attacks after stopping the drug than I had to begin with! So in spite of the fact that it worked great to begin with, I would NEVER take this medication again. All in all it turned out to be a terrible experience. There are other far less addictive and nasty drugs available for anxiety.
1528	fluvoxamine	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	obsessional thoughts ocd	within 2 weeks obsessional thoughts were less, so much so that she could return to work, she increased dosage slowly over a few months to maximum 150mgs with marked improvement in her obsessional thinking and she was able to complete a masters degree. After one year slowly decreased dose. Would definately take it again if obsessional thinking returns in the future	some constipation and solomance, but not too severe, the befefits of the drug outweighed these	as above
116	haldol	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	psychotic out nof control patient	Was able to gain control after receiving the injection form of the medication.Was helpful in decreasing aggitation,psychosis,delusions.At the end of the required time in seclusion and after giving medication time to take effect patient was able to return to facility population without any further problems.Was able to maintain in a calm manner,much less aggitated and was able to meet to staff to discuss delional ideas.	Drownsy but no untoward effects.Patient was able to be put on routine dose of this medication after effectivness of medication was evaluated to help prevent further problems.When routine dosage was begun patient was given routine medications for any side effects.	Patient became aggiatated,delusional and psychotic and needed to be medicated for safty of patient and others.Required seclusion for decrease stimuli for mediation to take effect.Patient was medicated and given the quiet of seclusion and was monitored for saftey.At the end of seclusion time was released and placed back into the facility mileu.
2354	propecia	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	male pattern bladness	There were no benefits that I could perceive.  The hairloss continued but worst of all the side-effects from this drug are severe and permanent.  This is very disturbing!	Sexual Dysfunction, depression, swelling, fatigue, redness and insomnia.  These side-effects were SEVERE and PERMANENT.	This drug should NOT be on the market!
3165	prednisone	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	ulcerative colitis	I never really had any complications with my disease. It seemed to help treat the ulcers in my colon. It also let me be able to eat normal foods because when a person has Ulcerative Colitis they have to monitor what they eat and usually have to eat bland foods. It really helped me a lot but the side effects took away from the overall rating. The side effects most likely worsened because I was on the drug for a long period of time.	I had dry eyes, trouble gaining weight, and loss of energy.	My doctor had me start out by taking 6 tablets a  day, three at breakfast and three at dinner. After 2 and a half months he had me start taking 4 tablets a day and 1/2 a pill less every week, until i was down to 1/2 a pill a day for a week. After that I stopped taking the pills.
1078	effexor	4	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	anxiety	less anxiety, emotional stability	terrible withdrawal	treatment consisted of drug combined with therapy.

1810	oxycontin	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	chronic nerve pain from back surgery	when the drug wears off pain starts to increase to an almost intolerable level after taking 1 dose the pain is swept away and left feeling almost 100% better. BUT I must take 2nd dose in 12 hrs, to keep pain at bay.	constipation which can be relieved by stool softener which is a fair trade off to me. another effect as I found out is that it dries out your mouth and causes gum disease and now all my teeth need to be removed	After 2 back surgeries doctor tried numerous pain relief options and none seemed to work used physical therapy to strengthen lower back and 1 tablet 80mg twice daily to alleviate pain
2836	singulair	3	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	asthma	I'm told it opens airways, but also hear there are neg side effects. Witout it, I'm a bi more weazy, but not much.	I hear its bad for heart (singulair) but am not sure and have not noticed. I may notice marginal effect on digestion, but it may be unrelated.	I purchased it in generic form most recently in India. I take one tab nightly. When my asthma is worse, I take it and it helps marginally. It is supposed to be leukotrine inhibitor.

Every second evening I also brushed the solution on the underside of the lashline on my upper eyelid by pulling my eyelid up (being careful not to get it in my eyes).

1611	avage	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anti aging	Avage contributed to maximum exfoliation to treat both hyperpigmentaion and minimization of lines, creases and wrinkles. It also helped to minimize pore size and added a more radiant look to my skin (it was very dull and drab).	Some type of basic moisturizing cream must be applied over the Avage. If the moisturizer was not used the avage was to strong to use daily. I have used Avage without a moisturizer on a every other day time table.	after 30+ days skin condition greatly improved.

I couldn�t go for more than 2 minutes without coughing, and couldn�t sleep through the night.  After suffering for well over a week, I finally was prescribed Tussionex (my spouse was too), and it was the most amazing relief � it suppressed the cough, and I could finally sleep. Due to the side effects, I haven�t taken it for any common colds or flus, but it was worthwhile for my severe cough.

Taking a whole pill gave me relief but also a light headed sensation and odd heartbeat. I bit the pills in two to take approx. 50mg.  Gradually my system became inured to it's effects and I had to take the whole pill, also occasionally it just doesn't work anymore.  I have long lasting recurring headaches and have always been worried about overuse and rebound headaches, but so far, so good.

None of the side effects that are usually mentioned.  However, I do now have restless legs at night which I have not mentioned to my dr yet.  I hadn't thought it was related to the detrol until I saw on another post that someone else was complaining of restless legs at night after taking detrol? So I will mention it to my dr. because it is very annoying. The only other side effect is some drowsiness in the afternoons but it does pass.	I had been suffering for years with an overactive bladder but had never brought it up to my dr. until our daughter was getting married in Jamaica and I just knew I could never make it without some help.  Doctor gave me sample and I saw improvement and tolerate it well so I have been on it ever since.

I believe I tore the hip flexor several years ago in a yoga class and it never healed properly. Sitting at a desk for work aggravates the pain, and I bike every day which isn't good for it either. Additionally from sitting every day, my upper back and shoulders are often in pain. Celebrex took ALL aches away, and took my hip pain from a constant worrying sharp pain, down to a very mild twinge. LOVE IT.	NONE.	Took a pill. Swallowed.

There were no side effects physically while taking the medication.  Quick recovery process."	None that we could see. Patient has had problems with other medications causing stomach upset and similar conditions but in this case it was not relevant.  We found however, that also by applying some cortisol directly to the infected areas, the sores healed very quickly.	Other than taking 4 tablets daily (with meals and before bed) for ten days, there were no other details.  Patient responded quickly to the treatment and had no noticeable side effects.  We found this drug to work quickly and effectively.

Gas was bad at first along with consptipation.  Gas and constipation disappeared when I lowered the dosage from 2 mg per day to 1 mg per day.  Neck/shoulder tension/pain still exists, but worth it to stay smoke free.	Began Chantix Starter pack, then quit on Day 7 or 8 of Chantix.  Been smoke free for 30 days with no withdrawal pains whatsoever.  I plan on staying on 1. mg of Chantix for another 60 days then tapering Chantix until drug free.  This is a miracle drug.  I could not have quit without Chantix.
3811	solodyn	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	folliculitis of scalp	Solodyn contains minocycline and is formulated to be taken once a day. This was very convenient and easy to remember. It can be taken with or without food. The Solodyn seemed to reduce the number of inflammatory lesions, and reduced irritation and itching was considerably.	After a couple of weeks, the Solodyn produced heartburn and nausea. This was very uncomfortable, enough to disturb sleep at night. Solodyn also makes skin sensitive to the sun, so I had to remember to apply sunscreen every day, with at least a moderate SPF (SPF 30+). Healing and resolution of the folliculitis seemed slow, taking months.	I took one Solodyn each day. I also washed my hair and scalp with Clobex shampoo, and applied Mupirocin ointment directly to the lesions.

3076	emsam	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	"chronic ""atypical"" depression"	I have been on every SSRI made- trial after disappointing trial since I was 19. This is the first medication that has worked for any length of time. (Paxil worked for a short period of time but maxed out w/o further benefit even with augmentation).	The worst side effect I had was insomnia. At first, insomnia was OK because I was, for the first time, happy to be alive and being happy more hours of the day seemed hunky-dory. Of course sleep-deprivation isn't good for the brain and started to wear on my job performance. Tried many different sleep agents to no avail. (I have absolute tolerance to anything ending in -pam apparently). For the longest time I could sleep no more than 1-2 hours per night (but felt rested). I'm up to 4-5 hours (pre-med normal amount) without any sleep meds.	"No response to 6 mg, slight response to 9 mg, full response to 12 mg. I have adhered to none of the MAOI dietary restrictions (eat a lot of soy as a vegetarian, drink 2-3 tap beers upon occasion) with no adverse effect.

Problem- looking to augment now. After being on 12 mg for most of a year, ""atypical"" symptoms (overeating, oversleeping) returning and 12 mg is max dosage. Even so, I still feel better than I ever had previous to taking EMSAM."

Had sinus infections every year and then twice a year, went to dr and would be on antibiotics for 10 days or so and get better.  Well I finally went to a specialist and all the previous years I thought I was better, I was not.  My sinus were so infected he said I had a chronic sinus infection which was probably 4 years old.  He treated me for months with antibiotics and still could not clear up infection.  Sent me to Ear, nose , throat dr. and he wanted to do surgery right away.  That was 2 months ago.  After using the Flonase in combination with singular I have not had any problems.  Post nasal drip gone!!! which is a huge blessing.  Wish I had this nasal spray 10 years ago.

There were no know side effects caused by the treatment. I was very happy with the absence of side effects and the overall simplicity of the drug.	The NuvaRing was inserted once a month and kept in place for three weeks. After the third week, the ring was removed so that a menstrual cycle could ensue. After 7 day, a new ring was inserted. There was no pain associated with the insertion or removal of the ring, nor was there any discomfort during sexual intercourse. Overall I am very pleased with the NuvaRing and will continue to use it until I decide to become pregnant.
757	flonase	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	chronic sinus infections	I have had 1-2 sinus infections anually, compared to one every 4-6 weeks prior.

1949	lyrica	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	periferal neuropathy	Definite lowering of feet and leg pain, numbness and foot-sensory control.  However due to the length of diagnostic time required and the progressiveness of the problem, Cymbalta (in a.m.) and Lyrica (in p.m.) work well together.  The neuropathy does not both me at night, once I am laying down and settled.	Some dizziness, balance, and memory issues.  Some days are fine, others are disconcerting but livable.	Lots of testing at the Mayo Clinc (unmedicated) and then medicated with Lyrica, eventualy Cymbalta was added and works quite well about 60% of the time.  Prolonged walking or standing, driving over an hour,the wearing or shoes with backs, and socks exacerbate the neuropathy.  Some lower leg and foot therapy and massage also assists for short periods by releasing endorfins(?).

325	ativan	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	anxiety	Absolutely none. My original dr. prescribed me Xanax, which, for me, is a life-saver. New dr. wouldn't put me on it, so I got Klonopin instead,(1mg, 3x's/day). After Klonopin made me sleepy, I asked for the only other bz he was willing to prescribe,(Ativan),and w/in one week was going through massive w/drawals from the lack of potency of the drug. So, back on Klonopin and the problems went away like that. May as well have been a sugar pill. Needless to say, I found a dr. to prescribe Xanax, and have had no problems since.	Absolutely none.	Read above.
668	erythromycin	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sinus infection	I was able to get rid of an infection that had been bothering for awhile.

447	lorazepam	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	anxiety	The ativan decreased my anxiety so that I was able to sleep through the night.	2 mg was way too much.  After 7 hours of sleep, I continued to be spaced out and clumsy, bumping into walls and dropping things for another 7 hours.  My mind also felt really slow, stunned and stupid.  These side effects were so strong, my co-workers noticed and were concerned for me.  A week later, I took half a pill to ease my anxiety and help me sleep.  The side effects were less, but still noticeable by others the next day at work.  The last two times I tried ativan, I only took 1/4 of a pill.  It did still ease my anxiety and the side effects were mild, but I decided I'd rather live with the anxiety than live with a mind that felt slow and stupid.

713	accutane	10	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	moderately severe acne	Oily skin & hair reduced, clear skin, long lasting results!	Very dry skin, sensitivity to sun, red/dry eyes, severe dry lips, frequent nose bleeds and rashes, minor depression, back pains, and easily worn out.	I am only 15 and wanted to not have to fight acne for the rest of my teen years. I have tried multiple amounts of acne medications, but were all ineffective and I suffered more than I did on accutane. Yes, the side effects were odious, but it was nothing that I couldn't handle. The worst was probably the dry lips, in which I soon discovered that the classic Cherry Chapstick was sent from heaven (and must be applied consistantly). I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient. I eventually had back pains and wore out easily, red eyes, nosebleeds, and minor depression. In addition, IPLEDGE and the monthly blood tests are a hassle. But from the first week I started to clear up continually without initial breakout until now I am 100% acne free. I used to have very oily skin and hair, which now I don't have to worry about. I know results differ from each individual, but I wanted to spread the word that it can work, and I have a lot of friends that have benefited from this product also. Acne is not the end! Accutane can really boost your self confidence. I would recommend on giving it a try. It could change your life forever!

I finally got to a bed in the emergency room and laid on my side. In less than 1 hour I had 2 shots in my rear and one in my arm informing I was having severe adverse reactions to the meds. They went from the top of my shoulders, down my back, to my stomach and legs. This was worse than having a baby and I had 3. I am still laid up today and have had a leave of absence due that I am unable to walk or sit at present. I am very upset at the slow process and the information on side affects do not talk about these adverse affects.

Just keep lotion and chapstick handy, and you'll be fine.	the doctors started me off on high dosage and gradually reduced it.  usually, it's two or three pills a day with meals.  also, one drawback is the monthly blood tests and dermatologists visits.  they are time-consuming, but worth it.

I noticed that situations that would normally aggravate me (i.e. stress of work, children, college assignments,etc.) I was able to handle better.	"Although some stress was alleviated, I noticed that I spent more time in a ""vegetative"" state. I am normally a very active person who enjoys exercising daily. While on Lexapro, I found myself preferring to just relax and watch televison (did cause slight weight gain due to this). More serious and traumatizing side effects was the sudden onset of severe chest pain, rapid heartbeat, dizzy spells, sweating, fatigue, numbness in legs and nausea. The first episode occurred one day at work causing an ambulance to be dispatched to job. From that day on, these attacks happened quite frequently, my doctor took me off the medicine. However, these attacks continued to occur for over a year later (never happened to me before Lexapro). In fact, these effects started a two year long string of attacks, visits to cardiologists, emergency rooms, my fear of exercising as increased activity seemed to affect my heart and induce rapid heart beat. I began to fear driving as my dizzy spells would occur for no apparent reason, as well as the numbness in my legs. No doctor was much help, in fact I often got treated as if I was crazy and was just told that I am suffering from panic attacks. I understand that panic attacks can occur out of nowhere in ones life and once you have them you may experience continued anxiety. I believe the Lexapro opened this pandoras box for me though. I read somewhere that an earlier version of Lexapro (or similar type of pill) caused heart problems thus was pulled off the shelves. Who knows the story behind that. It has taken me two long horrific years to get back on track. I am now approaching my issues naturally and am doing better (not to say this completely stopped my life - but it did seriously change it)."	I took approximately 5mg a day. I visited my doctor on monthly basis, and was in contact with her via phone during first several weeks (my doc was old school... she really cares about her patients). I was placed on this treatment as I was a single mother of two very young children, employed full time, and attending college full time. The stress wasoccasionally overwhelming and my usual source of alleviating stress (exercise) was no longer helping.
1619	premarin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hormone replacement therapy	I had a complete hysterectomy at age 52 and started HRT to avoid the immediate menapause which occurred right after surgery.

I suffered from severe chronic body pain for 3 years, and naturally I searched for a physical cause but was never able to be diagnosed or treated correctly.

Now I can sleep at night, I am not fatigued during the day, I can complete tasks and have motvation, and most importantly, I am completely pain free. The number 1 cause of body pain in teenagers is depression, and many doctors fail to take that into account.

4111	chantix	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	smoking cessation	Quit smoking in 90 days	Nausea, Insomnia, Constipation, Erectile Dysfunction, Irritability, Fatigue	"I have taken Chantix for 6 months and would recommend this cessation method to anyone who is motivated to quit smoking! EVEN if you have a slight desire to quit then this drug is for you BUT only if the following conditions apply: 
1) you are in good mental health 
2) you are not in a high stress environment (I mean like combat or fight fires for a living) 
3) you can accept feeling uncomfortable for about 2 weeks while your body adjusts to the drug.

If you are seeing someone for mental issues then this drug is not for you! If you are in a high stress environment then leave this drug alone! If you cannot handle nausea, constipation, insomnia, or fatigue for extended periods of time then DO NOT take this drug.  The nausea will fade but it can get pretty intense and that seems to be the deal breaker for a lot of people -- I can hack a lot before I ""cry Uncle"", but let me tell you the nausea will come in waves and will wear you down. BUT in the end it was worth it!!!"

Xanax has helped maintain consistent sleep pattern.

3677	effexor-xr	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety, mild depression	"Venlafaxine is a bicyclic antidepressant, and is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), but it has been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It works by blocking the transporter ""reuptake"" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Additionally, in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well, implying that SNRIs may also increase dopamine transmission. This is because SNRIs work by inhibiting reuptake, i.e. preventing the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters from taking their respective neurotransmitters back to their storage vesicles for later use. If the norepinephrine transporter normally recycles some dopamine too, then SNRIs will also enhance dopaminergic transmission. Therefore, the antidepressant effects associated with increasing norepinephrine levels may also be partly or largely due to the concurrent increase in dopamine (particularly in the prefrontal cortex)."	Difficulty in reaching orgasm. Increased amount of ejaculate. Rare mild headache.	My uptake levels were not severely out of balance. I started with 150 mg and felt the positive effects in 20 minutes. I was told it would take a week. I reduced the dosage to 75 mg then 37.5 mg after six months because I felt those doses to be too strong. I know others that found this drug helpful. Others it had no effect on at all, even at doses of 300 mg.
2018	bystolic	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	heart palpitations	"I have had SVT's all my life.  It was only when I turned 24 that I sought treatment for them as they usually were linked with a syncope episode.  I was originally put on the grandfather of beta/alpha blockers inderal.  While this drug was effective at treating my migraines, it was not particularly effective at controlling my palpitations and it tended to lower my blood pressure too much.  I always felt tired and had little energy on this drug.  At 24 years of age I was not happy to have the energy of a 65 year-old.  Next came atenolol and labatolol (when I was pregnant).  I also had break-through palpitations with these drugs as well as low-enegy side effects.  With labetolol I could barely jog down my street without becoming significantly winded and according to my cardiologist I fell into the 94th percentile for ""in-shape"" people my age.  Finally, when bystolic hit the market I was thrilled.  First of all I didn't need a large dose of it to be effective.  Second, it was effective.  I experience no break-through palpitations, and last but not least there were very few to no side effects.  I had energy again and I could get throught my cardiovascular exercise without becoming winded."	The beta blocker controls and regulates your heart beat so it beats on time when it's supposed to.  It also however, controls your heart rate and doesn't allow it to race out of control.  So when exercising, many people have a hard time being able to get their heart rate up to pump enough blood to the lungs which is why you feel winded while exercising even mildly.  With Bystolic there is very little of this type of side effect.  Sometimes I don't notice it at all.	I take 2.5mg of Bystolic one time per day to control palpitations.  This drug is commonly prescribed for hypertension but I do not take it for that.  At this dose it does not lower my already low blood pressure very much but it is effective against the palpitations.
1260	provigil	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	narcolepsy	"improvement in daytime wakefulness without the ""peaks and valleys"" previously experienced taking prescription Ritalin for this condition. There's no excessive nervousness or feeling like I'm taking speed.  I just don't feel like I'm going to fall asleep."	None that I'm aware of.  I am starting to wonder if it has effected the health of my gum tissue, but there is no documented evidence to support that.	Once daily medication to deter excessive daytime sleepiness associated with sleep disorder Narcolepsy.  Downside of it is that it is VERY expensive.
2490	mirtazapine	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety and depression	Mirtazapine was very effective in treating chronic insomnia. I was not sleeping due to severe anxiety and moderate depression. The drug has significantly improved anxiety symptoms and is gradually lifting mood and reducing depression symptoms	"First week I experience fairly bad nausea, first month I was sluggish and tired and head felt ""foggy"" but persistence and going to a full dose resolved all of the problems. Only ongoing side effect is moderate lethargy."	15mg daily for first 2weeks, 30mg daily ongoing
21	sanctura-xr	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	overactive bladder	With OAB there was the urge to urinate frequently which felt like a constant mild bladder infection.  There was some relief after a couple of days on this drug. However, some days I felt as poorly as I did without them.  But after approximately 8 weeks almost all of the discomfort was gone.  I feel pretty normal.  One key to making this work is to deliberately not urinate too often.  I have noticed that now I sometimes need to remind myself to go.  I probably feel the urge less than I did before I had this problem.	Dry mouth if I fast from food.  If I eat normally this does not happen.  Other than that, no side effects.	Take one capsule in the morning before eating breakfast - on an empty stomache.

I would also have random panick attacks in public, triggerd by fealings of self conciesness, insecurity and confusion. After taking the medication, these problems were aliviated.	reduced overall emotional output - before taking Lexapro, i would have episodes of hyperactive behaivour, and would be very outgoing, loud and extatic. I injoyed these, and felt they were part of my personality. This was dumbed down dramatically by the medication. I also begun having non-life threatening Cardiac Arrhythmia, ie skipping heart beats, awareness of heart beat, palpatations etc. These were minor, and i have not sought any medical advice because of them.	10mg per day of escitolopram oxalate

675	zantac	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	reflux, gastritis	none	lump in throat, trouble breathing, tiredness, muscle pain	Prescribed 300 mg, once a day at bedtime for severe reflux and gastritis.  Took one pill and stared to have trouble breathing.  Took Albuterol and in a couple of hours breathing returned to normal.  Called doctor next morning and was told to discontinue use.  Did not work to control reflux.  Started on Pepcid the next day which along with Tums has made reflux managable.

Prevents burns to esophagus that can lead to esophageal cancer and ongoing pain.	None that I experienced.	"I was diagnosed with a moderate to severe case of GERG with an esophageal hernia over 7 years ago, and spent two years at physicians request trying a mix of different OTC drugs.   NO OTC drug worked to stop the burning and the coughing after meals caused by GERD. I tried most everything you'd find in the OTC shelf in a drug store.  Tums, Zantac, etc. etc. etc.   Finally, doctor ordered Prilosec for me, 1/day, 20mg, taken in am before eating.  At that time Prilosec with still not yet over the counter, still requiring a physician prescription.  It worked beautifully and I have taken it since, daily.  If I don't take it, symptoms immediately occur after eating.   It does NOT however stop the cough that occurs after eating or otherwise from GERD. Recently, I have had to increase my dose ""occasionally"" to 1 pill also before dinner, but that is usually only if I'm eating later than expected.  I have never taken Nexium -- the HMO didn't cover it, but since Prilosec works so well, I don't feel the need to experiment."
1952	lyrica	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	neuropathy / anklosing spondylytis	Lyrica reduced the pain associated with my anklosing spondylytis when other therapies had failed.  I had tingling, numbness, pain, and very limited movement in my arms and legs from A.S. after developing 6 moderate sized bone spurs on my cervical spine.  It was severely limiting my ability to have any sort of life.  I have tried almost every form of pain killer from OTC to narcotics with very limited effects.  Lyrica works differently and I find that I can be RELATIVELY pain free.  It does not totally eliminate the pain but what it does is make it bearable so that I can function.  I could take more of it according to my doctor but I am more comfortable taking the lowest possible dose.  I've noticed that I have no more tingling, very little numbness, and a greatly expanded range of motion without pain.  I highly recommend this drug!	"The treatment side effects are somewhat severe.  The first dose I took almost immediately knocked me out!  I was so out of it, loopy, sleepy, etc. that all I could do is sit around and then go to sleep! It didn't get better after a couple of doses and I originally stopped taking it.  My doctor helped me build up a tolerance by stepping up the dosage over a week or so.  That limited the side effects but I still find that if I miss a dose by even a couple of hours, I start going through withdrawal and start feeling AWFUL!  I don't feel better until I get the dose!  That is somewhat scary to me and keeps me from trying a higher dose but the benefits of having a ""normal"" life outweigh the side effects and I dont' know of any safer options to do that."	Treatment details?  I guess you are asking for how often, etc.?  I am on ongoing therapy.  I take one in the morning and one in the evening.  I try to keep my dosage schedule very precise because I pretty quickly show signs of withdrawal if I miss any.  It has allowed me to start physical therapy, which was previously unavailable because of the pain.  I feel much better but this is an ongoing disease that is not curable only controllable so I don't know what the future holds and if the treatment will change...
849	ritalin	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	narcolepsy	No longer fell asleep at inappropriate and dangerous times. For the first time in my adult life I was able to concentrate. I was able to effectively work and study.	Extreme fatigue when not taking ritalin such as on the weekend. Sometimes I was so fatigued, taking ritalin was unable to keep me awake. When I used ritalin during the day at work, it reduced my inhibitions in social and business situations and I would blurt out things before I had the chance to internally filter them. Experienced periods of sleeplesness at night.	I would set the alarm for 6am, take ritalin, go back to sleep until 7am. This gave the ritalin time to kick in so I could feel awake when I arose. Just after lunch I would take a 2nd dose of ritalin 20mg SR to keep me awake and able to concentrate through the afternoon.
698	accutane	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Completely cleared up my acne b/4 my wedding.	Very dry mouth, nose and skin.  It essentially dried up the acne.  It worked amazingly well and the effects lasted for probably a couple of years after a one time 6 month treatment.  I wouldn't take it again however, b/c I wanted I to have babies and did have trouble conceiving years later but, it is unknown to me if this was a result of the acutane.  I do have one biological son and one adopted son.	2 capsules daily and lots of chapstick.
3473	ambien-cr	4	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	I did eventually fall asleep but it took a while (was told it only takes 20-30 min. but ended up being a couple hours, I read and eventually fall asleep and then the quality of sleep was poor; I just toss and turn all night I have 23 left I'll keep taking till gone, maybe they will improve over time.	Amazingly unlike other sleep aid's I've taken, I didn't wake up groggy most of the time, the only time I did it only lasted about an hour. I did like the fact I didn't feel drugged half the next day.	One pill every night before I get ready for bed, treatment for insomnia.
1362	lupron	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	uterine fibroids/heavy bleeding	The drug stopped my menstrual periods and put me into artificial menopause.  The hope was that it would trigger my body to go into menpause and stop the heavy bleeding associated with my fibroids.  Unfortunately, my period came back approximately 2 months after the last injection	Hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness.	I was injected once a month subcutaneously in my abdomen just below the belly button.
1139	methadone	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	opiate dependence	"I have been able to maintain sobriety and get my life back on track.  Methadone has allowed me to get my ""bearings"" underneath me, and really focus on what is important in life once again. After about 6 months, I began working and have been promoted consistently since then.  I am currently tapering and am really trying to be smart about it.  While I am very eager to be off methadone, I also do not want to rush it.  I feel that methadone should be one of the last options a person looks to when trying to stop opiate use because it isn't something that can be stopped whenever a person feels ready.  I have found it to be quite a complex task."	WEIGHT GAIN, WEIGHT GAIN, WEIGHT GAIN!!  I don't know if it's just because of the methadone slowing your metabolism, or if it is caused by the need to eat sweets but I have gained at least 90 lbs since starting methadone 7 years ago. It is likely a combination of both.  I have also seen a sever decline with my teeth, and the only cause I can think of is methadone.  I have taken such good care of my teeth, as far as self care and making sure I see the dentist every 6 months, and that still hasn't helped.  Has anyone else noticed this?  I have started having sever pain in my joints as well, especially my knees.  I can honestly say though, that without this medication I probably wouldn't be alive to experience any of these minor side effects.  Without a doubt, methadone along with the therapy I received while in the clinic and my families support has saved my life. I will take the weight gain and minor discomfort any day, at least I am here to write about it.	I had tried many times to get sober before beginning MMT.  I started methadone after 3 unsuccessful tries at in-patient and outpatient therapy.  When I first began treatment, I traveled 2 hours a day to received the dosage.  After about a year I was lucky enough to get in to a clinic closer to my home but by that time, I had completed all of the necessary counseling hours and had also received all clean swabs and urine tests and was given 3 day take homes.  Eventually that was extended to 6 days which is the most in my state or clinic that you are allowed. It has been about 7 years now, and I am in a total good place in life and feel that it's time to start tapering.  I have held the same job for almost 5 years, have a car, have my finances somewhat in order and am ready to move on to the next phase.  While I have had a relatively easy time of tapering, I had to stop for a couple of weeks because I started feeling some slight stomach cramping and body aches.  I made the decision to go down 2 mgs a week in hopes that such a small amount per week would allow my body to easily adjust to the change.  So far so good and I am hoping that by next summer I will be completely done.
873	paxil	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I am less angry, sleep a little better, MUCH less anxious. I am able to play with the kids without unhappily obsessing over all the things I should be working on. I can just chill out and be in the moment.	sleepiness the next day, maybe more acne	Clinical depression runs in my family. My sister was clinically depressed at the age of 9. She and I were both sensitive, angry, sad, and sometimes suicidal. I have just lived with it, not really taking meds much. I have to notice a difference in a few days if I am going to stick with something. My aunt told my sister that the people in our family do well on Paxil. My sister felt that it worked for her for a year or two, so I started taking it because it has reached a point where I have to be happy or die from stress. the Paxil had a noticeable effect on my anxiety levels in a matter of days, and an effect on my level of general happiness in a matter of a week or two. The doctor prescribed 20 mg which I just can't take because it makes me too sleepy the next day. I take 10mg which was enough for the first month. Now 10 mg is almost not enough, I can feel the anxiety there sometimes but more Paxil will make me sleepy. My 10 year old son inherited the family depression problem, he's been talking about killing himself and others. He started taking Paxil also, I have noticed a big difference. He is not angry so much anymore. It is helping us truly. I usually won't take prescriptions, I think they make people sicker sometimes. I will keep taking this stuff as long as the benefits outweigh the problems.

Without Tramal life was very down.	Immediate sleepness, so needed to be careful when I took the tablet.  Had to be careful if I took any other medications or alochol as there would be 'high' episodes.	I only was required to take one tablet in the evenings, this was easy and I never forgot.
1758	topamax	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine	My headaches have been considerably reduced; however, I still experience some mild headaches. The relief from my chronic and debilitating headaches has been a miracle thus far, and while I've had some pretty irritating side effects, I'm willing to put up with them so that I can live my life relatively pain free. I'm hoping the pain will pass.	Tingling of my tongue, toes, and fingers. Some speech issues, word finding issues, major spelling issues - especially when handwriting. This is especially interesting because I'm generally an excellent speller. Unfortunately I have not experienced the weight loss side effect.	Titrated up very, very slowly. Just recently reached my 100mgs, and have been on that for about a week. I'm hoping the weight loss will happen now that I've been on that for a week, just recently have lost my appetite.

3260	allegra-d	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergies	allergies were completely cleared up while on the medication.	dry mouth was the main side effect.  the other was that after taking my evening dose, I would go to bed at an appropriate hour and fall asleep, but would wake up after about 5 hours and would be WIDE AWAKE until bed time.	mostly for seasonal allergies or occasional reactions to things like dust or pet dander.  was on the medicine for about two years but now my allergies are much more mild than they were at that time (moved to a different climate where the allergens are not as prevalent).

Although I still get the odd pustule one week prior to menstruation, I do at least generally now have a clear complexion.  My face is still rather rosie - most people think I look healthy!

It also increased my sex drive, but this stopped after a while. 

It also moderately decreased Psoriatic Arthritis pains and also symptoms in nails and joints, but needed to be taken very regular for this.. Forgetting to take it twice a week already made it work less effective.

(Cabergoline was more effective, had less side effects- but potentially has side effects on heart valve, so one needs to be very careful with it. )"	"Some dyspepsia. This was all the side effects I noticed. I did not like these side effects though and therefore discontinued when the psoriatic arthritis  seemed to be under control. When I discontinued Parlodel, I  took Cabergoline( with a much longer half life in the body) in a very low dosage to make sure that my Prolactin levels only gradually moved back.
I know once I took Parlodel and stopped and then took a Prolactin test 48h later and the levels were higher then without taking any meds.
So best is to decrease dosage slowly and not suddenly. I think this is the case with any ergot derivative."	"Taken for 6 months. Once daily, but half a tablet of 2.5 mg was taken after a while to reduce side effects. I found the best way to get a stable prolactin levels and best improvement was to take half a tablet once in morning and once in evening.

I was diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis, symptoms were mild, but psorisis was clearly visible on nails. I considered if there was a link between my elevated Prolactin and the psorisis. Found this on the internet and asked doc to prescribe parlodel."

3379	lipitor	3	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high cholesterol	It did lower my cholesterol slightly, but that may have also been du to a change in my diet.	I had quite a few side effects, which is why I discontinued using it and switched to a natural remedy.  Some of the side effects I experienced included chronic constipation, difficulty digesting food and sporadic stomach pain.  I found it difficult to enjoy eating food as I often felt a heavy feeling in my stomach after meals which was very unpleasant.	I took the Lipitor initially with morning meals and was not having a good result (regarding my digestion) so my doctor had me switch to taking it on an empty stomach, which did not seem to help much.  Overall, I am happy to not need this drug anymore.

It might have been move effective if I had taken it before pain started. As it was, it took about two hours to get relief.	Main effects were nausea, light headedness and room spining.	Drug prescribed for pain after surgery.  If I had taken  drug a few hours after surgery, anticipating the incision might be become painful, the outcome might have been different. Because I waited, I took one pill about 9 p.m., another about 11 p.m. and it was not until midnight that I got any relief.  The next morning, I was nauseous and and light headed. I don't take any medication, so the impact of the drug in my system  was noticeable and not pleasant. On second day after surgery, I took a couple of Advil.  After that,  nothing.

The remainder of the dosage resulted in secureing my clarity and allowing my skin to look and feel better.	Mild to moderate dryness on the lips and face. Mainly on either side of the face. I noticed very dry lips but peppermint beeswax lip balm seemed to fix the problem. Dryness seemed to be non existent with no blemishes but as soon as a cyst became visible it annhilated the surrounding area in dryness.	After trying topical treatments, subscription products and tetracycline for many months, and with no decernable difference, my family doctor put me on a cycle of Accutane. I was thrilled with the results, and could see the medication working almost instantly. The side-effects dimished after about 3 weeks. I used, and continue to use, 5% benzoyl peroxide gel cleanser and spot treatment (both Panoxyl brand) while on the medication.
1186	prozac	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	Maintained a general feeling of well being and being able to cope with life.

Not only was my back pain temporarily eliviated, I got uninterrupted sleep while I was taking this medication.  Before then, I hadn't slept for almost a week straight.  It was very important that I allowed at least eight hours of sleep.  I made the mistake a couple of times of taking it when I wasn't going to get a full nights sleep and ended up severely drowsy and unalert.  On those two occasions, I ""made-up"" for the missed hours of sleep and over slept.  This did not help, as it furthered my sleepiness.  I sort of had to get on a schedule again.  

When taken properly, it can be very helpful."	Drowsiness if not enough time is available to sleep.  8 hours.	To treat aches and pain associated with back pain and insomnia.

2186	clonazepam	8	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia and anxiety	"Prozac makes me feel just stabilized not really ""Happy"",it really just levels me out so i can cope with everyday life and the stresses involved. It was one of the better medications i have tried and have tried several over the past few years that really did nothing. Seroquel was also prescribed for sleeping . I took that in combination with the clonazepam"	prozac affects my sex drive mostly and i get headaches, the clonazepam i really don't feel any side effects except it doesn't always work and the seroquel puts on water weight gain makes you ravenous and can leave you feeling disoriented if you do not get enough sleep	i am being treated for several disorders and will most likely remain on meds for life as i have recurrent depression and chronic insomnia. The phobia seems to dissapate but it can also return again as i have developed it twice, or i could develop another phobia. In essence i have relapsed seen a psychiatrist, a counsellor, and my doctor along with the medications as part of my treatment program over the last 1.5 years
1016	estrace	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	vaginal dryness	reduction of hot flashes, and reduction of vaginal dryness. I'd already been trying a vaginal estrogen ring, but this wasn't enough of a dose for me, apparently. Since taking out the ring, which I'd had in for 6 months, and using the cream instead, things have been a lot better (i.e. less dryness, and less pain with intercourse. Yay!	none	.5 mg cream into vagina, 3 nights per week
1491	metrogel	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	redness from rosacea flushing	None.  This product as all prescription and nonprecriptions products that are available in the USA have offered no relief whatsoever from the flushing of Rosacea and extremely sensitive skin.	This product immeidately caused my skin to turn bright red.  It stung and I had to wash it off.  I tried it a couple more days and then gave up, just as I have on all Rosacea medications.  Very very frustrating.	My dermatologist doctor has yet to find something to help me.  I have also had laser treatments that are suppose to calm the skin but to no avail.  There is a new medication out that is like doxycycline but is suppose to help the redness of Rosacea.  I can't remember the name of it.  But I tried that also and was on it for two months.  With no improvement, the doctor stopped me taking it.
1096	effexor	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	menopause symptoms	Effexor was prescribed to alleviate hot flashes, and to help me sleep through the night.	"The most noticeable side effects, especially in the beginning of treatment, were mild dizziness and large pupils, making me sensitive to light, after waking up in the mornings.  That usually only lasts for 30-60 minutes.  
Side effects after taking for approximately 2 months:  Very vivid dreams when failing to take medication regularly.  Also, after approximately 2 months of treatment, the medication does not seem to be helping as much as in the beginning, as I am starting to wake up several times throughout the night again."	Will only take for 6 months as I have heard that Effexor is highly addictive & causes severe withdrawal symptoms.
852	nystatin	4	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	candida rashes	Candida rashes did not disappear. I was doing an anti-candida diet at the same time. i.e cutting out sugars, refined carbs etc. and taking oregano oil, probiotics, pau d'arco tea, caprylic acid. Cream did not work any better than ti tree oil.	None.	I have found other creams to be more effective. Most notably Clotrimazole and Hydrocortizone.
3534	lunesta	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	insomnia	Lunesta definitely put me to sleep and kept me asleep until morning.	There was a hangover from the medication well into the morning hours after waking.	For years I had suffered with insomnia until my doctor prescribed Lunesta in a 3mg dose.  It worked very well putting me to sleep and I did not wake until morning.  Unfortunately I could sleep 10 - 12 hours and still wake up with a hangover from the medicine.  Sometimes a half of a pill would do but I would still have somewhat of a hangover although not as bad.  Now I only take during times of stress when sleeping is more important than any of the side effects.
784	naproxen	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	joint pain	I didn't feel my joint pain after taking this, I think because I was too bothered by the side effects.	I had the most intense stomach pain I've ever had in my life.  The pain was nearly unbearable.  It felt like I had an acid stomach with extreme pain.  I drank milk and had taken this will food and still had stomach pain.	I would much ranther have the joint pain, then go through this stomach pain ever again.  I've stopped using this and would not recommend it to anyone.
607	minocin	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	cystic acne	My cystic acne was reduced. My face did clear up consistently with the help of the pills and creams such as retin-a.	I needed to take the pills with lots of water, so I was always taking trips to the bathroom. I was on this pill for a long time, and I dont know if the constant ringing of my ears was a side effect, I did visit an ear doctor for this problem I thought was tinnitus but the doctor assured me the minocin had nothing to do with it. The ringing of the ears continued for about a year after I stopped taking minocycline. Occasionally I still get a ringing of the years, it can be sudden but lasts for a second or so...I was never diagnosed with tinnutus, but the ringing did lessen until it left after i stopped the pills.	I was to take the pills twice a day with water. I took one in the morning after I ate, and one at night with plenty of water....after a year my body became resistant to the pill and stopped working, and i started taking higher doses without my doctors consent..which was wrong of me and dangerous and maybe that is why the ringing of my ears began...but I was obssessed with clearing up my acne. I was young, I believe i was 17 or eighteen when i started minocin and was on and off it for about 4 years.
174	depakote	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bi-polar disorder	Made the patient feel normal pretty much.	Depakote made me sleepy at first, so we switched the dose to nighttime instead of day and night.  Prozac, I have some ear pain from it.  Lithium upsets my stomach if I take too much at one time, so I don't.  I take one pill in the morning, and one in the evening.	I see a psychiatrist regularly.  He originally prescribed me Prozac many years ago, when I started seeing him after my husband left me abruptly alone with a three-year old son.  I felt like I was losing my mind.  The prozac helped calm me, but it was really when I began taking the Depakote that I began to feel good about myself, and anchored enough to take care of my son, who is now 19.
1209	prozac	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	After 6 weeks of taking 10 mg  of Prozac, physical anxiety symptoms  dramatically dimished. Now, 6 months after beginning treatment, my blood pressure has also fallen. With BP medication alone, my BP hovered around 135/85. Couple with Prozac, my blood pressure is consistantly in the 110-120 over 80-80 range. I also experience very little panic attacks ( I used to have several a day). When I do experience one, I have been able to self talk myself down from it.	mild veryigo for 2-3 weeks	10 mg Prozac every morning

100	celebrex	1	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	mild bursitis in left hip.	Minimal, if any.	Occassional nausea and slight dizziness.	After two weeks of taking Celebrex I was able to walk easier but I feel the progress was due to staying off the leg and keeping it elevated. Celebrex did absolutely nothing for the intense pain. When the prescription ran out I started taking 800mg ibuprofen (prescription) every 6 hrs and within 4 days I was walking normally.

1250	catapres	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	sleep disruption due to hotflashes at night	I am sleeping more deeply, especially during the first four or five hours after falling asleep.  I still have hot flashes during those hours, however I seem to be in a deeper state of sleep and during those hours I usually don't fully awake during the hot flash, as I used to do.  I used to be almost fully awake every time I experienced a hot flash (every 1 to 1.5 hours).  Now I get a few hours of fairly good sleep at the beginning of my sleep cycle.	There are no adverse side effects so far.  Some nights I don't sleep as deeply (as described above) during the first few hours of sleep.  I'm not sure what makes the difference from one night to the next-perhaps the amount of sleep I got in the few nights previous.	I take one tablet at bedtime.  I try to delay taking it until I'm just about ready to go to sleep, since the effect is most pronounced in the first few hours after taking the tablet.  Later in the sleep cycle, my hot flashes wake me up more fully, as they have for the last four years.
745	flonase	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	nasal allergies	This drug reduced inflammation in the nasal passages, successfully treated hay-fever type symptoms, and also helped with hoarseness probably due to the fact that it cleared up post nasal drip.  I like to sing and I found I could sing longer without getting hoarse.	I experienced no side effects, but I was careful not to use this drug continuously over a long period of time, just in case.  Generally I would start using it when symptoms were bad, stay on it for 2 to 3 weeks, then ease off.	2 sprays in each nostril once per day.  It takes about 36 hours to notice a beneficial effect.  Once my allergies were cleared up I could cut the dose in half and stay allergy free.
334	neurontin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	difficulty sleeping because of nervous system prob	Helped to promote sleep without side effects, hangover or any of the other problems associated with other sleep medications.  The sleep difficulty was caused by a horrible reaction to another medication called Celexa, which appeared to sensitize my nervous system even after the Celexa was stopped.  Ever since taking the Celexa my nervous system has been exquisitely sensitive, with symptoms such as pain, heart palpitations, restless legs, and other such things that totally interrupted my ability to fall asleep and stay asleep.	None	Used 400-500 mg at bedtime.
2924	tramadol	4	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	rib pain and muscle inflammation	I had inflammation in my ribs due to severe coughing from bronchitis.  Doc told me to only take tramadol in cases where the pain was severe and not to mix with my muscle relaxer (flexeril).  Tramadol did do a decent job of taking away the pain and helping me sleep.	I took tramadol once, that's all it took for me to decide I didn't want to take it again.  I took it in the evening and went to sleep a few hours later, it made me very sleepy.  Upon waking up in the morning I felt extremely nauseous, shaky and - it's hard to explain, I felt inside my head a lot.  Very cloudy headed.  I thought I'd feel better if I took a shower but ended up throwing up b/c I just couldn't stand up, all I wanted to do was lie down.  I felt very dizzy. I laid down for about 10 mins and felt a little better, stomach was still upset though.  I ate something and immediately felt nauseous, was shaking uncontrollably and sweating.  I threw up again.  The episodes continued through most of the day.  But I felt better as time went on.  I decided the side effects just aren't worth it!	Overall Tramadol just isn't work the side effects I experienced.  I'd rather take a few Aleve and deal with the left over pain.

I broke 3 ribs and my leg in two places around me knee. I also tore my acl.  Given 2 dilaudid injections in ER and prescribed 4 mg tabs to be taken every 4 hrs.  Did this for one week and began having the ""mental"" side effects (specifically nightmares and mild hallucinations) after 3 days.  I started taking the 4 mg tabs every 6 hrs and eventually every 8 hrs and these side effects diminished.  Constipation was a serious issue with the 4 mg tabs.  Got a refill for 2 Mg tabs and were definitely less effective but experienced only light side effects (mainly inability to focus).  Took 2 Mg tabs for the remainder of the occasional pain outbreaks for the remaining 2 weeks"

"Unexplainable behavior: Constructed the letter ""P"" from toilet tissue, later had no recollection and couldn't explain why I did it. Apparently told husband to consult with nurse friend about my medications, but forgot and was upset when he did so. Visual hallucinations: while looking at my friend, saw her hair rising as if being blown from below; wherever I focused strange things happened. Thought they were really happening. Soon after med discontinued, became severely nauseated and started vomiting, unable to tolerate food or liquids for 20 hours, had to take zofran."	Was prescribed 2-4 mg dilaudid (I took 2mg, weigh 95#)with hydroxyzine pamoate 50 mg every 4 hours, because following previous surgery both percocet and vicodin caused vomiting and itching. First dose was given in recovery room and continued to take it every 4-6 hours with vistaril as prescribed until untoward symptoms appeared. I had no nausea, vomiting, or itching

And this terrible feeling of pretending all the time, at work, with friends, that i was ok, had disappeared. 
Before getting pregnant, i was a bit afraid that i have to stop the medication by my doctor told me to go on, that there was no known side effect with pregnancy, so i went on. My son is now 14 months old and is a wonderful healthy little boy, with a happy mother !"	none	one pill, 50mg/day, for 6 months at first, then as a regular treatment.
3480	diazepam	3	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	to relax muscles	The Zydol was effective in reducing my pain after the dose was increased from 50 mg to 100 mg.  The Diazepam made me sleep all the time which was a good thing as I believe the body heals while sleeping	I will never take Diazepam again as it gave me a headache, I had unpleasant dreams and I felt that I was not always here, so trying to focus or remember things was dificult.

3877	levoxyl	4	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	hypothyroidism	I am not sure if it was levothyroxine that helped to normalise the hormone levels.

Levothyroxine (25 mcg)was taken 30�60 minutes before breakfast daily, for almolst 2 years. The doctor told me, that i should take it as long as i live.

Experience drowsiness that should not have been present.  I had to take this tablet daily for it to be effective and since I noticed the drowsiness in the daytime that I found impairing, I decided to switch to nigth time.

In addition to using dust proof casings on my bed and avoiding areas where mold and mildew were apparent,t he zyrtec really assisted in helping me feel relatively symptom free.  Some of the symptoms I typically had were itchy watery eyes, congestion and occasionally rashes.  In some extreme cases, the rashes were extreme as in hives.

1478	cymbalta	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	major depression	"Cymbalta got me out of a major depression.  I am still taking it.  It also relieved my back pain for about 6 months but that good effect has diminished.  While I still am not the happiest camper, I am able to function normally.  I was not able to function before the cymbalta.  When I first got on it, I had extreme fatigue for several days and some ""electric jolts""  when I was lying down.  However, that side-effect has gone.  It also causes some constipation, which is something I've rarely experienced!  I eat a very high-fiber diet but even so I'm not my ""normal"" regular self.   I'm writing this because of all the negative things I've read online.  If I had read them before I started the cymbalta I would not have gone it.  I'm happy I did not read anything!  I now feel that these reviews are written by  people with miserable results, or people who are incredibly impatient and expect and instaneous cure are the folks writing most reviews."	"I've stated most of the side-effects I had in the above paragraph.  Basically these were:

1. severe fatigue that diminished over several days.

2.  a few ""electric jolts"" that also disappeared after a couple of weeks.

3140	ortho-novum	7	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	The prevention of pregnancy was the benefit in addition to almost completely eliminating a monthly menstrual cycle.  Other than that, there were no other benefits involved in taking this medication.  The benefits at the time that I was taking this drug outweighed the risks. However, at this time, the risks and side effects now outweigh the benefits.	After going off of the birth control pill, I noticed an elevation of mood.  When I began taking the pill after being off of it for a while, I noticed the difference in my mood.  My mood is much more consistently positive when not on the drug.  In addition, now that I am older, I have no desire to take this medication as the potential side effects/risks are too high for women who are 30+. The risks that most concern me are risk of blood clots and stroke even though I have never been a smoker.	I took the birth control pill for approximately 10 years fairly consistently. There were periods of time during those 10 years when I did not take the drug.  I am no longer taking the birth control pill and do not currently see this as a viable option for me given my age and potential side effects.

460	flagyl	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	diareaha	I didn't see any benefits, what else can I say? I had to take this to counteract the side effects of clindamycin.	Anorexia, insomnia, bone and joint pain, vomiting, irritability ( I'm still pissed about all this). Weakness depression, suicidal ideation, so weak I have been unable to leave my bed for more than a couple of hours a day. I'd rather just shit myself to death than to take this crap. Christ, if I didn't have leukemia, I just wouldn't even go to doctors. I mean, their ok if you need to get put back together after an accident or something, but most of the time they, and their petrochemical nostrums, just seem to cause mote problems than they cure.	3 pills a day for two weeks, symptoms came back, took it 4 more days and then, knowing what would be in store for me if I took it; I found that I could not force myself to take even one more pill.
1052	femring	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hrt (hormone replacement therapy)	The Femring is a vaginal ring containing estradiol that was effective in providing HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) thereby eliminating hot flashes, vaginal dryness and other menopausal effects.

1408	adipex-p	5	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	weight loss	They gave me a little more energy for the first week or two.  But then after that, no noticable increased energy was felt.  The first 3 days my hunger seemed to be less, but I think this was only due to a plecebo affect.	None that I could notice.  Then did not give me insomnia.	I was about 50 lbs overweight.  I was eating all the time, but mostly after about 9:00pm.  And I was always craving sweets.  I tried to get myself to the gym, but I was too tired all the time.  I tried other appetite suppresents, like hoodia, but nothing seemed to work.  The I finally talked the doctor in to prescribing me phentermine.  She was reluctant because I have high  blood pressure and I take medicine for that.  But I took my blood pressure everyday for the 3 months and I had NO increase in pressure as long as I took my medicine.  Unfortunately, after the three months, I had only lost 5 lbs. which, I always seemed to fluctuate anyway.  So to recap, phentermine did absolutely nothing for me.
1573	xanax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	Xanax took the edge off of the anxiety without causing drowsiness or interfering with thought process. The anxiety was due to court testimony and memory recall of 5 years prior. Calendar dates were going to be of importance.	There were none whatsoever except the anxiety returned when the drug wore off and when I was anxious my memory recall was negatively affected.	Xanax was prescribed for me because I was a plaintiff in litigation and my accurate testimony was imperative, especially memory recall of specific dates 5 years prior to my testimony. The defense attorney was a rude and nasty old man and was deliberately trying to confuse me to the point of tears. My attorney had warned me beforehand about the defense attorney's tactics so I asked my doctor for a short term tranquilizer. During recesses in my testimony (2 days) I would take a Xanax to keep me focused. It worked like a charm and I won the case. It just seemed to keep me sharp, rather than sedated.

2647	aldara	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	superfacial basal cell carcinoma	removal of superfacial basal cell skin carcinomas without surgery	moderately severe skin blistering and seeping	"The treatment involved a 6 week period of applying a small amount of cream directly to the affected area of my chest with no harm to surrounding ""good"" tissue.  I was directed to apply the cream every evening before bed for 5 nights in a row then allow a ""rest"" period for 2 days. After about 1 1/2 weeks I started getting blisters that eventually started itching and seeping.  I called my derm and was told to wait for about a week and then to reapply the cream.  I did as instructed and all the abnormal skin cells were gone but I was left with small pink colored scars all over my chest.  I have worked for about 2 years applying many different things to even my skin tone back up with only limited success.  Since my first experience I have been given different instructions on the use of Aldara which includes a less vigorous treatment schedlue.  I have learned since that I should not have allowed the severe skin reaction that I thought was part of the treatment, wrong!"
419	imitrex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraine	The imitrex I first took by giving myself shots, but now just take the 100mg tablets.  I no longer have migraines.  As soon as I feel a migraine start, I immediately take a tablet, and within an hour the headache had subsided.  No one should have to suffer with migraines anymore.	I have not had any side effects.	Decribed above.
742	flonase	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinus congestion / allergies	My dry cough and sinus infections were virtually eliminated.	some light nasal bleeding and a dry mouth when not taken precisely as directed.  It's important not to let the medication go too far into the nasal passage so that it doesn't go down the back of the throat which will lead to dry mouth.	When I began taking flonase I was experiencing at least annual sinus infections and waking frequently from a dry/choking cough.  The coughing is a very rare occurence for me after taking flonase and I have significantly fewer sinus infections.

1398	nardil	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression (atypical)	A dramatic decrease in the level of depression and a great increase in a feeling of well-being and hope for the future.  There were also considerable cognitive benefits: thought processes speeded up, memory became stronger and intellectual creativity increased.  Also the constant fatigue that accompanied the depression decreased and this made possible an exercise program that increased energy and enjoyment of strenuous activities.  In addition my general and social anxiety decreased dramatically.	The most troublesome side effect was faintness upon rising quickly from a seated (or horizontal) position.  On one occasion I lost consciousness and fell.  However, this side effect went away after three months or so.  There was also some decrease in sexual desire, but this side effect also lessened over time.  A side effect that seems to be permanent is lower blood pressure, but this is actually a benefit for most people.  I've been told that some people take MAOI's solely to decrease their blood pressure.	It takes some time to build up to a clinical dosage.  As I recall, my doctor had me take 15mg for a weak, 30mg for two weeks, 45mg for two weeks until I had built up to 75mg.  I did not begin to feel the antidepressant effect until I reached 45mg. When I reached 60mg the antidepressant effect had kicked in fully and I even experienced a period (two or three weeks) of a mild euphoria, which I have been told is fairly typical.  My doctor thought that a slow buildup of the drug in my system was the most effective treatment.  He also had me taking Lamictal (150mg per day), which he thought might spark a stronger reaction to Nardil.  There are also some diet restrictions: no aged cheeses and no aged meats.  Also, some cold medications must be avoided.
1448	cymbalta	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	Daily anxiety lessened considerably. When stressful situations arise I am better able to handle them although I am still able to feel somewhat anxious which is good. I don't want to be a zombie with no feelings at all.	There is a possibility of elevated blood pressure but my medication for the blood pressure seems to be doing the job.	I just take 1 pill daily.
3294	zoloft	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	traumatic brain injury	"Zoloft made me feel considerably better, which is to say it decreased the severity and frequency of my ""why me"" or ""I suck"" bouts, but the underlying facts were still the same."	There was a definite decrease in sexual desire and performance, but it is hard to say if the zoloft is to be blamed for everything.	I was put on zoloft while still in the hospital having suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury. I was just taking whichever pills the doctors set out for me, and when i left the hospital i just continued taking zoloft, because i knew i was going to be depressed. I continued taking it for about a year and a half after leaving the hospital but eventually wanted to try living with a clear mind. When I stopped the dosage gradually (as one is well advised) I went on living ok, but was still depressed. I was looking for something to take my mind off the recovery, so of course i dabbled in alcohol and the occasional marijuana use, but I eventually went on to realize that i didn't need any drugs at all. There is something to be said for a natural high, but i decided to put myself back on the lowest dose of zoloft in hopes of clearing my mind so that i could go back to school without the depression hampering my focus.

375	lamotrigine	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	migraines	None.  Had to discontinue use after three days because of severe side effects!	Within hours of taking the first dose I had vaginal itching.  Since I read that was a side effect in the paperwork, I didn't think much of it.  After two doses, the itching turned to a burning and sourness in the pubic area.  I thought it might have been irritation from wearing leggings with no underwear (from the seam).  The medication was taken at bedtime.  When I woke up after taking the third dose, I had blisters on the outer labia.  Late that night, while on an hour+ drive home from a nearby city, I was in severe pain.  The blisters got worse, severe headache, severe backache, chills and all over aches like the flu.  During the drive, I felt so bad I was praying for my life so I could continue to raise my children, even though I do not believe in god!  It is now the next day after that horrendous drive.  My blisters continue to worsen; my entire pubic area is sore, itching and burning; and I have developed a swollen lump on each side of my pubic area that is extremely tender and painful.  I have not taken my temperature but I'm sure I have one.  I feel like I have the flu plus all the gynecological problems.  I'm no doctor, but I highly urge any woman on this med that they discontinue use IMMEDIATELY upon ANY gynecological disturbances, no matter how minor you think they might be.  The goose eggs in my bikini area continue to grow and become more tender.	My neurologist that prescribed the med told me to see my primary gyn if symptoms are not gone a week after discontinuation.  Isn't that nice!  I live in a rural town and don't have an established gyn right now so it just is not a good situation.  BEWARE!!!
979	macrobid	4	Ineffective	No Side Effects	uti	Took the medication for bladder infection.  Never missed a dose and took it for five days.  Infection subsided, but returned about 1 week later.  Would recommend a longer time period.	I had no side effects from the medication and tolerated it very well.	100 mg twice a day for 5 days.
1216	prozac	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	mild depression and anxiety	So far, I have experienced an uplift in mood and a dulling of anxious reactions and PMS symptoms.  I can't say it's all due to the Prozac, as I'm employing CBT methods, but my anxiety has not escalated into a full blown attack and I generally feel a lot better about life and about myself.  I'm still weighing if these benefits are worth all of the symptoms I'm experiencing.  It's been hard to maintain a positive outlook when I don't feel normal due to the trembling and tremoring.	Immediately after beginning treatment I experienced heartburn and nausea that would come in waves all day long.  Due to this, I lost 6 pounds in a 3 week period (worrisome because I am a normal weight).  About a week and a half later the nausea started to subside, but then I noticed I was feeling very stimulated. It was as if I could actually feel energy rushing in my body, and had to keep moving or get up and do something with myself. Soon after this began, I started experiencing trembling and tremors/twitches in my hands, arms, legs, feet, and neck.  Generally the tremoring subsides when I am up and moving, (e.g. walking), but when I start to relax (e.g. sitting or lying down) I tend to feel it more.  At first there was a twitch here and there, but now it happens very frequently and all over.  No sexual side effects noted yet.	I was prescribed Prozac for managing mild depression and anxiety attacks in conjunction with weekly counseling and cognitive behavorial therapy methods.  when the trembling and tremoring began, I went back to the counseling center to ask about them.  The psychiatrist had said some people react to Prozac in that fashion and that the side effects wane in time.  I also read that stimulating effects such as those were actually fairly common in Prozac users.  I go back to MY Psychiatrist in two days to discuss the effectiveness of the pill, the side effects I'm experiencing, and whether or not we should continue.
3714	lamictal	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	reverse the insomnia medication	"I can now sleep at night and not during the day, although easily stressed these drugs have enabled me to carry out my daily routine with no day time sleeping.
I still would never attempt to work outside the house, the stress level would tip me over. I don't have panic attacks anymore unless a major confrentational situation arises."	Weight gain large weight gain, dry mouth, even when I am exhausted I cannot sleep with out this combination of drugs. I am worried about the side effects that may acure which the doctor explained, liver fuction altered, diabetes, seizures, weight gain.	Fortnightly visit to psychiatrist, just a general chat, but when something tips me over like my brother dying, or my eldest son has a bad temper and says very aggressive and rude conversation, my nerves, panic attack, depths of despair, At those times I require a session with her and also take a different medication, once of.(serequel)
404	restasis	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	dry eye	This did nothing for my dry eyes, which cause me to have blurry vision at times.	Stinging when first applied, lasting approximately 15 minutes, and some redness.	This medication is very expensive.  Without insurance expect to pay between $270 - $300 for a month supply, depending on which pharmacy you use.  Even with insurance it costs me $68 a month.  If you read the insert that comes with the drops it states that clinical trials show only 15% of patients show improvement.  Had I read that BEFORE I wasted the money on 3 montjs worth of this stuff I wouldn't have even bothered.  Waste of money!
2480	enbrel	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis	There was a complete halt of pain in the foot, which was the most affected area with arthritis, within 3 weeks of use. Swelling of the foot was gone within 5 weeks.	I have not experienced any side effects.	I feel that it is definitely easy to contract a bad cold and then very difficult to overcome it, with the use of Enbrel. However, the benefit outweighs the liability. I would also recommend that the patient have good insurance. This medication is very expensive.

3567	differin	2	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	acne	There were little to no benefits to using differin to treat acne.  while it may have helped exfoliation, it did little to treat current and to prevent future acne.  instead of differin, using a separate skin exfoliation product in addition to an over the counter acne treatment might have been more beneficial.  My acne worsened using Differin -- some say it is because the impurities are being purged from beneath the outer layers of the skin.  I don't know if I completely buy this theory though I would have believed it if it showed some improvement after three months.  Unfortunately, it did not.	There were no side effects to the treatment except that it worsened my breakouts.  However, it did nothing to take down the flares even after three months of treatment.  Soon after I stopped using it, my skin improved.  So now, I choose to use an exfoliation product and a separate over the counter acne treatment product.	differin did not help prevent acne or get rid of current acne.  it worsened the condition though it was explained that as it helped the skin exfoliate, the impurities beneath the outer skin surfaced.  however, there were no improvements after three months of application.
93	pristiq	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Pristiq elevated mood and energy levels.	Increased anxiety	Pristiq was prescribed at a 20 mg dose and then increased to 40 mg dose.

3221	neoprofen	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	headaches, menstrual aches/cramps, fever	THE BEST painkillers ever! Quite low dosage when it comes to the active substance used but it does work perfect. I like the fact that they come in two different dosages 200mg and 400mg. When taking this medicine I think that one should take ones weight and the severity of the condition that one wants to treat.	None that I have experienced. These are supposedly one of the least invasive painkillers on the market.	I have used it to take down, fever, headaches, PMS cramps, lumbago, the pain just vanishes.

1860	augmentin	4	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	bacterial infection	Mild improvement of symptoms, however the symtoms were not eliminated.

831	zegerid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	gastritis	The symptoms of the gastritis resolved completely within 12 hours after the first dose and were not experienced at all while on the treatment. There were no troublesome side effects compromising compliance. The once daily dose was also ameanable to comlpeting the course of treatment with ease.	None were encountered thus ensuring compliance as stated above.	The once daily dose was extremely effective in controlling the debilitating symptoms of gastritis and maintaining the symptom-free period while the treament was taken. There were no side-effects encountered which would have otherwise compromised compliance. The treatment is highly recommended!
428	imitrex	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	disapearance of migraine headache	vomiting	took 1 pill on onset of migraine.  I found I needed to take the pill at the very first inkling of a headache coming on.  If I waited until the migraine was full blown, a second pill would be needed at the appropriate time.  If caught early, one pill would make the migraine go away

3784	keflex	2	Ineffective	No Side Effects	n/a	None.  I had a bacterial infection accompanying my flu and there wasnt a single noticeable benefit.	The only good point I suppose is that there was no adverse reaction, such as yeast infection or stomach upset. The downside was the bacterial infection quickly got worse.	Absoutely innefective.  I easily could have been takign a sugar pill for those results.  Bacterial infection became coniderably worse and was later put on another antibiotic to relieve symptoms.

3911	nexium	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	heartburn/gerd	Complete reduction in heartburn & reflux.	none noted	Nexium worked very well for a few years.  Then, the daily dosage needed to be increased to twice daily.  At twice daily, the same effectiveness has been maintained.  It definitely controls the GERD & heartburn.  At one point, I tried to come off this medication (to have a more natural lifestyle) this was a huge mistake as I immediately had a return of severe heartburn & reflux.
2782	keppra	1	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	grand mal seizures	seizures dissipated	brain fog, slurring, neurological switching, i.e, right hand dominant at times would switch to left, thyroid malfunction, high FSH levels and very early perimenopause, memory lapses, cognitive dysfunction	Began with Keppra 1000mg..wasn't enough to control seizure activity - increased to 1500 mg per day and was non-functional. Reduced to 1000 mg per day and sought alternative methods..research by Harvard showed magnesium deficit in those with seizure disorders..began magnesium injections and increased essential fatty acids..through proper nutrition, supplementation and accupuncture, no more seizure medication and seizure free...do want to note that seizures began during the spraying of the neurotoxin anvil for the West Nile virus.
282	xyrem	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	narcolepsy/cataplexy	Before taking Xyrem I had to take a daily nap to feel refreshed. I had vivid hallucinations and I had to control my emotions.I would also get up to use the restroom approximately 10 times at night. Since i started taking Xyrem, I stopped taking those daily naps, no more hallucinations and I am able to laugh;cry more with less muscle weakness. Eventhough I only sleep for 6-7 hours max, I wake up feeling refreshed.	When I take the first dose I noticed that I dont have trouble falling asleep. When I take my second dose 3-4 hours later,I am super dizzy. If I need to use the restroom I have to hold on and hurry back to bed.	I take my first dose (3.0 g) around 11 pm. take second dose around 3 am. I wake up like around 6 am. I want to stay in bed for more but cant. I am not sleepy. There are mornings were I am still feeling groggy, and by noon i would be okay to do my daily chores.
2915	tramadol	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acl reconstruction	I found tramadol quite effective before and after surgey to reconstruct my knee (acl).	side effects however ocurred almost straight away on intial dose of 100mg.The worst of which is a constant feeling of tiredness and lack of energy.This has not subsided even after a year of taking this medaction. Other side effects i have experienced are blurred vision and on the rare occasion mild muscle spasms.I also have found this drug to be addictive with a feeling of nervousness mixed with mild depression if a dose is missed.	100mg twice daily seems to work well for myself however if you can get away with taking co codamol i would recomend this first. co codamol worked wonders for me for the first 3 months however i soon built up a very high tolerance and was taking 60mg of codiene 4 times a day to get any effect hence the change to tramadol.
3185	desyrel	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	fibromyalgia	Prolonged sleep, less pain	"Drowsiness - should only be taken at bedtime.  Not safe to drive while when medication has been taken.
intensifies effects of alcohol."	Trazadone is actually an anit-depressant that did not work well.  It is used with many fibromyalgia patients who do not reach the 4th stage of sleep.  With out Trazadone, I have trouble falling asleep, wake numerous times during the night.  Due to this the muscles do not have time to rejuvinate, and I would awake in the morning unable to move - with much achiness and soreness at trigger points thoughout my body..  With out sleep, depression also set in.  Trazadone helps me to sleep helps to illeviate many of the terrible symptoms of Fibromyagia.
343	neurontin	1	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	migraines	My migraines did decrease significantly while on this medication. There was a clear inverse correlation between my Neurontin dosage and my migraine frequency and severity (more neurontin, fewer migraines)	"I was a zombie. Some aspects of this subsided over the first year, however others did not. My vocabulary suffered horribly and never really recovered. I went from being a very well spoken person to someone struggling to grasp some words over three letters. Coworkers even mentioned to me that they noticed this effect. My memory suffered horribly as well. I would have to cut back on my dosage during exam times (I was in school as well as working at the time). There seemed to be absolutely no way for me to memorized the volume of work I needed to while on this drug.

The sleepiness I experienced was awful. This diminished somewhat but never entirely over the four years I took it. A couple of times I had to pull over while driving; staying awake seemed to be out of my control entirely. The sleepiness was overwhelming at times. I once fell asleep while speaking one on one with a coworker. While on Neurontin I also had an annoying tendency to forget what I was saying mid-sentence--very embarrassing in a professional setting. Since abandoning Neurontin and switching to Lamictal I no longer have this problem."	Used as a migraine prophylactic, my Dr. simply increased my dosage over time from what I believe was 300mg. per day up to 2400 over approximately two months. I was to take the medicine throughout the day but I sometimes opted to take a bulk of the total dose at night before bed--the fatigue it produced in me did assist my sleep. Unfortunately no matter when I took it my sleep was also assisted while in my car or at my desk at work! This decreased over time but was still in certain circumstances a danger. I will say however, it did decrease my migraines--the greater my neurontin dose the less my migraines. But I opted to take my migraines over falling asleep driving, possibly killing others or myself. Unfortunately my physician did not take this side effect seriously the many times I told her; after three years of this she continued to insist this side effect would subside. It did lessen but NEVER subsided to a safe level. She's no longer my physician and I now take Lamictal.
2698	detrol-la	8	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bladder pressure	For the most part, the pressure feeling I constantly had in my bladder went away.  Sometimes, especially in the middle of the night, the pressure would return slightly.  Instead of having to go to the bathroom 2-3 times during the night, I was able to only have to get up to urinate once a night.	I would wake up with a very hoarse voice.  Usually, the hoarsness would disappear during the day, but sometimes my voice would crack when I spoke.  Also, your throat is dry and irratated.  It's almost like you feel like you're getting a bad sore throat but it never quite turns into one.  My mouth was a little dry, but hardly noticable.	I was prescribed it after a bladder infection, which was cleared up, lead to a pressure feeling in my bladder.  I take the medicine once a day.  I guess the medicine is slow releasing but once in a while I felt like I should take a dose earlier than prescribed.  I am also scheduled for physical therapy on the muscles of my bladder wall, but have not started them yet.  I did this kind of therapy 10 years ago when my bladder had this same pressure feeling and the therapy did help--I'm looking forward to starting it and hopefully getting off the medication.
2802	wellbutrin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	smoking cessation	"The idea is to take one pill each day for three days and then up the dose to twice per day.  At day 10 the patient is to stop smoking altogether.  I did this and found that in fact by day 8 or 9 I felt an eversion to smoking.  
Niggling cravings every few days trickled to a craving once a week or so which is weak and easily overcome. 
The prescription is typically for 3 months but I didn't need any refills at all.  I stopped taking the drug after a month or so.
I recommend this drug ONLY UNDER THE CARE OF A PHYSICIAN to anyone interested in stopping smoking once and for all.  
Certainly a person must be commited to the decision to quit smoking though or save your money."	"The most obvious side effect for me was difficulty sleeping.  
Hard to take but I knew that it would be temporary and I knew that I would rather have spotty sleep for as much as a few weeks in trade for not smoking ever again.
The difficulty sleeping didn't last long into the treatment, though.  A week maybe.  
I remember reading about other side effects like a dry mouth, but the most alarming one is possible seizures.  Talk to your doctor."	"Treatment details are above (oops).  
Once a day for three days and twice a day (twelve hours apart) for up to three months after that.
At day ten the patient should stop smoking cold turkey."

1119	effexor	6	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	I noticed significant changes in the beginning.  After about 2 years, the dosage needed to be increased and is now at the max.  I am experiencing an ebb in effect and have no way to increase the dosage now.	Horrific nausea and feelings of body shock when a dose is missed.  If I could have chosen a different drug when I started, i would have done so.  The withdrawal effects are so bad that I may be on this drug for years to come just to avoid the pain of withdrawals.	-

0	azor	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety attacks	Can get a good nights rest and anxiety attacks are supressed. I have been able to lead a normal life and be successfull. I am doing my doctoral now in medical research and belief without Azor it would not be possible. I remember what my life was before Azor and am relieved to know it is behind me. I have been on it for years now, the benefits outweighs the disadvantages- I know Im addicted. Azor was and still is prescribed to me by my psychiatrist.	Some lethargic tendencies and drowsiness at times when taken for anxiety attack. Also, I am addicted to it. I can not sleep witout Azor.	"I take one tablet (0.5g) Azor whenever I have a anxiety attack or struggle to sleep. 
I was attacked a few years back, and still have panic attacks on occasion and struggle to sleep considerably. In addition, I have nightmares. However, when I take the azor, I calm down. Furthermore,I did try sleeping medication, however,I was always tired and struggled to wake up. When I take azor, I can sleep without the whooziness the following morning."
1593	xanax	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety/depression	I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably highger dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck.	lethargy, loss of appetite.	I was started at .5mg, the second strength of dosage, 2 times daily. I became afraid of it because I was taking it to calm me from coming down off opiates, however, I was already on a medication to stop me from taking opiates, which was actually not supposed to be taken with alprazolam because of concerns that both medicines cause respiratory depression.

1426	adipex-p	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	over weight	the doctor told me that this medication would suppress my appetite as well as increasing my metabolic rate which would assist in weight loss.  As I only had to lose 10kg I am not sure that I was the best candidate.	"I was warned about blood pressure, kidney, and liver problems, I was told to look out for the shakes and a general feeling of being ""on speed"".  I admit the only side effects I felt was a slight case of feeling light headed, I found I had a lot more energy."	I have found this medication worked quite well for me but I only lost minimal weight but it did help me develop better eating habits.  At first I was hesitant as apparently it can disturb blood pressure and as I was using minoxil at the same time but I have not experienced anything bad from this.
2033	protonix	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hiatal hernia and ileocecal valve syndrome	I was told to avoid coffee, tea, chocolate & peppermint :'(  My hiatal hernia is tiny, but I feel fortunate that I was told about it before it got out of hand.  I feel 100% better 90% of the time, and when I don't, it's usually because I forgot to take my pill the previous day.  I would prefer for my pain to be treated by diet changes alone, but it's nice to have a pill to rely on.  It's my goal to control my pain naturally, wish me luck!

Highly effective."	None	Nuvaring is a very easy to use method of birth control. Even though the instructions advise you to take the ring out for three weeks, and have a ring week free after, my OB/GYN recommended that I leave it in for four weeks and on the day the ring should go back in just put a new one in.

Keeping the erythema affected are rested, by keeping it resting up when sitting down or lying down with a cushion to aid.

I took the pills for around two years then heard on the news that many anti-depressants were no more effective than placebo. I decided to stop taking them, I weaned myself off over a few weeks. After this time I was a new person, the world felt real again, I was no longer plodding through life in a daze, I was so much happier, the things I used to enjoy I started to enjoy again. I am extremely angry that I cannot get back those years that I was taking various anti-depressants that turned me into a zombie who did not care about anything or anyone. I understand everyone is different and these may work for some people, but for me these drugs ruined my life, if you are taking them you could be missing out on so much, please consider whether they are doing more harm than good!

3810	solodyn	2	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	acne	At first I started with the 65 mg dose for about a month and it really helped my skin. All acne was reduced. I think during this first month though is when I started to build up reactors and an allergy to this medication.	I went back to my dermatologist who recommended I take a stronger dosage which is when I took th 90 mg. After about 4 or 5 days I broke out in huge welts of hives. Very severe. I went to the urgent care unit and they prescribed me with steroids and zantac. The next day it just kept getting worse. My whole face itched then my lips got puffy over night. My arms are peeling and are swollen with hives. It spread throughout my body and with all the benedryl and steroids and zantac I've been taking, nothing seems to help! It's extremely irritating and I am miserable.	I am going to see the doctors again today because there is no improvement whatsoever.
2388	synthroid	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	weight gain	Initially, I was concerned because I had knee surgery and was on crutches for six months.  I gained weight rapidly and didn't know why.  After taking a blood test, it was determined that my thyroid level was low.  Once taking the medicine, my blood tests came back ok, but the weight did not decrease as the doctor had said it would.	There have been no side effects to my knowledge.  I do realize that if I do not take the medicine as indicated that I get tired more frequently and feel slugish.  I am concerned that there may be a better alternative to taking synthroid.  I have heard of medicine that can be taken in two pill form and that may better correct the thyroid imbalance.	I take one pill everyday at the same time.

I took benadryl without consulting my doctor which helped but the drowsiness was unmanageable. So my doctor told me to try zyrtec and I feel like it has helped tremendously. I only have a slight cough throughout the day but it is manageable. I wish it would take my cough away as well but I can deal with it. I take 10 mg in the morning but my doctor said to take it at night because it might cause drowsiness. It hasn't caused me drowsiness so I take it in the morning because it is easier to remember.

1742	topamax	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sedative/hypnotic - to induce sleep	topamax was originally prescribed to eventually replace in part or totally the Elavil I was taking as sleep med.  Elavil and Effexor were thought to initiate cravings for carbohydrates that would lead to overeating and overweight.  I was taking 300mg Elavil each night.  The goal was to completely switch from Elavil to Topamax.  Topamax also had the added benefit of preventing migraines which I am prone to because of my hydrocephalis caused by a sub arachnoid cyst. I have a VP shunt	I had to stop increasing the dose of Topamax when I reached 225mg because I experienced peripheral neuropathy in my fingertips and also blurred vision.  I am now taking 150 mg topamax and 225mg elavil hs.	"The switch from elavil to topamax was slow and painful and not altogether successful, but I almost immediately experienced a 15lb weight loss as a result.

I was told to increase topamax in 25mg doses every week.  When excessive sedation was experienced, I was to cut back 50mg of Elavil.  I proceeded like this until i reached a topamax dose of 250mg and elavil 150mg, but I wasn't sleeping at night and my vision was blurred and my fingers tingled.  The doses were fine tuned to a comfort level of 150mg topamax and 225 elavil to this date.  Switching the effexor to cymbalta is the next phase, all in the name of decreasing the carbohydrate cravings....wish me luck!"

1982	fiorinal	7	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	headaches	This drug does an excellent job of relieving my headache pain.  No OTC drug comes anywhere near reducing the pain like this prescription does.  What I used to do for headache pain is lay down in a darkened room with an ice pack on my forehead.  If I could fall asleep usually the pain would be gone when I woke up.  Problem is that it is not always possible to find a quiet, darkened room when a headache comes on.  This prescription relieves pain completely within 45 minutes.	"I feel kind of spacey for about an hour after I take it.  Do not recommend driving, or trying to think or make decisions during this time.

Also, I notice that now I cannot tolerate headache pain without these pills... same pain as before only now I just can't handle it at all."	I have (what I think is) sinus-related headache pain.  Pain is always in the forehead on the right side.  Changes in barometric pressure always bring a headache on.  Sometimes the pain is so bad I vomit.  I had sinus surgery (drilled holes in sinus cavities in forehead... sorry I don't know the medical terminology).  This relieved the headache problem for about 5 years, but it is  back again.  I think I would rather have another surgery than continue to take these pills.

By the third week into taking Lexapro, I had to call my doctor and requested to have a different drug in replacement.	To treat the Major Depression Disorder and Anxiety Disorder, I visited my psychologies on a weekly basis, and my psychiatrist once every two or three weeks. The first drug that the psychiatrist recommended was Lexapro, and I started with the 5 mg dosage, after which I took the 10 mg for about three weeks. As mentioned above, I had to call my psychiatrist by the third week to request a different drug due to significant side effects.

Otherwise it was the general feeling that foreign drugs were in my body as I do not usually take any kind of drugs.	The treatment being described as above. I consider it to be a mis-diagnosis and was quite disappointed that a Medical M.D. who not consider that I knew my own body well enough to know what was really wrong. Hence, I was diagnosised and prescribed incorrectly. Knowing this I did not follow through on the treatment plan. The only reason I decided to take the meds in the first place was because a nurse friend of mine also convinced me I should take the meds. They were both wrong.

Perhaps a little dizziness to begin with. As far as stuffy nose, I get sinus infection in the winter, so no way to tell if drug is affecting that.	Went to my physician. He did digital exam. Prostate appeared normal, but physician said I could have swelling on side or prostate he cannot feel. He prescribed tamsulosin. It did the job!

Once I developed a permanent depression at an injection site, which is caused by a localized destruction of fat tissue. Some patients (I never have) develop a short term reaction experienced immediately after injecting this medicine.

These symptoms may last a few minutes then go away by themselves without any further problems. Each package of Copaxone contains a complete list of possible side effects, or you may obtain this list from your doctor or pharmacist.	Each single use blister pack of Copaxone contains one prefilled syringe containing 20 mg of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) which the patient self administers subcutaneously, in the fatty layer of skin, once a day.

My hair is now thick and shiny again.  I did not have weight gain so I cannot comment on that.	I did not experience any side effects.  My doctor is very hesitant to give me the generic version as there are many cmplaints that the generic version does not relive symptoms.

I was able to eat normal sized meals again.	I had no side effect with the treatment.  The only drawback was the need to eat within 30 minutes of taking the medication.  There were times when an unavoidable delay in the mealtime made it necessary to eat something else in the interim.	I didn't have usual GERD symptoms of heart burn.  I was skeptical that my stomach was producing too much acid.  I tried other home remedies like drinking diluted apple cider after a meal that seemed to work at times but didn't always.  After my doctor prescribed prilosec, it took several weeks before relief was complete.  I am still taking the medication but have scaled back to 20 mg just once a day.

1678	claritin	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	well controlled seasonal allergies and improved breathing.  I was able to use this medicine for allergies but also noticed that my general breathing, especially while working out, also improved.  Years later I was diagnosed with reactive airway disease instead of asthma.  I had noticed I had a much harder time jogging during the seasonal changes until I started taking the Claritin.  Then running became much easier, so it now makes sense to me that the Claritin helped so much.	none that I recall - was before claritin became OTC.  I really liked taking the claritin because I had no side effects, unlike some other allergy medicines I had taken earlier, and unlike some OTC I had tried earlier.  When taking the Claritin I felt that I was not really taking anything.  It was just easier to go about my daily routine and enjoy sports a lot more. I have really appreciated how Claritin has helped me.	The treatment details were very simple as far I can remember.  One pill once a day.  I stayed on the Claritin for at least three years.  I do not recall any side effects or problems during this time.  Eventually it seemed as if I didn't have any allergies because I had gotten so used to the positive effects of taking this medication.
1974	lyrica	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	fibromyalgia and myofacial pain	Nerve pain and muscle pain decreased significantly within the first couple days.  Fibromyalgia was very debilitating for me but with Lyrica, I was able to go back to work and function normally.  It helped with pins and needles, twitching, and muscle spasms.  It also seemed to help with some of the anxiety I experienced.	Constipation mainly.  I didn't gain or lose weight.  A little dry eyes and mouth.  I did have several colds the second year so it may have lowered my immunity.  These side affects was worth the benefits for me	I was first given 75 mg once a day and realized the medicine didn't last 24 hours so I started on twice daily doses and that helped.  I needed a little more pain reliever and started Tramadol along with the Lyrica.  I would take extra Tramadol if necessary, which provided relief at times when pain spiked.

Two capsules per day did the trick. Am able to sleep through the night the majority of the time!
2287	lexapro	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety	The benefits to the treatment were that my anxiety was significantly decreased.  It took almost two months for the benefits to kick in, but when they did it was well worth it.  The depression also decreased significantly.  I'm not sure if that was due to the addition of Wellbutrin, or if the reduction in anxiety was so great as to reduce the depression.	There were several side effects worth noting.  First of all, the Lexapro caused serious lethargy and loss of energy.  Taking the pill at night rather than in the morning helped with this side effect, as did the addition of Wellbutrin.  Weight gain also occurred, as well as a severe decrease in libido.  When weaning off of the Lexapro, severe dizziness occurred.	10 mg of Lexapro (daily) was prescribed.  It was taken every day for nearly two years, in conjunction with check-ups with the prescribing psychiatrist every six months.  (The psychiatrist determined that the anxiety was due to a chemical imbalance and not situational.  Therefore, regular visits and/or therapy were not necessary.)  After two years on the medication, treatment ended due to inability to tolerate the side effects noted above.  During the weening process, severe dizziness occurred.  The only way to alleviate the dizziness was to take a Lexapro pill.  As the weening continued, dizziness occurred less often and longer periods of time elapsed before it was necessary to take another pill.  Eventually, the dizziness ceased completely.
3458	tamiflu	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	flu symptoms	Strength returning, clarity, ability to breath improved	It took two days before any of the symptoms got better	The doctor only prescribed the exact dosage and days.  One tablet every day for 5 days.  I was disheartened that my health insurance only paid 10 - 15% of the cost of the medication because it was a very expensive mediaction.

However, it did come back after i stopped taking it, which meant it was somewhat useless.	I had diahrea and some stomach upsets....While i wasn't taking it for my acne, it seemed to have helped it. However, the Diahrea is something i've had with most antibiotics. I countered it by having acidophilus supplements, which worked really well.	None i can describe, just took two tablets a day. One before breakfast and one before dinner. The treatment lasted ten days and i took it religiously. I did have to take other acidophilus containing products to control the side effects but it was fortunate that it lasted only 10 days.
2400	synthroid	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypothyroid deficiency	The treatment remedied her lab values as well as treated her symptoms of weight gain and lack of energy.	Patient occasionally feels a bit shakey.	Patient was treated for low thyroid test results which coincided with the onset of menopause which manifested itself in a weight gain of 20# and a marked lack of energy.  The medication corrected her lab values and contributed to her ability to lose the weight gained and feel an increase in energy.
1453	cymbalta	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	More energy, the pall that was hanging over me was lifted.  I became me again.  I did not just cruise through life having no connection, I was engaged again.	Drowsiness.  Both the Lexapro and the Cymbalta makes me tired during the day, neccesitating a nap.	"Cymbalta 20 mg 2x a day for one weeek to get acclimated to it.

Cymbalta 60 mg 1x a day."
2686	prinivil	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	this drug lowered my mild hypertension to normal range	slight cough, especially at night	I was prescribed this dose five years ago.  I have been taking it daily ever since.  It works.  Ordinarily, when I check my blood pressure, it is in the normal range.  The common side effect, caused by excess production of mucus, is no big problem.
605	risperdal	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bipolar disorder	Stopped thinking that caused panic attacks and delusions. Helped me be able to parent effectively again.	Weight gain, loss of interest in creative activities, loss of interest in sex, loss of interest in work, inability to work, inability to feel or think or behave beyond the very basic requirements of living.	Overall the drug is zombifying and has made me numb. Inability to work has lead to the worst side effect of all... poverty on the pension for me and my children.  I take 500mg Tegretol daily (mood stabiliser... the doctors don't like to see me cry or look angry).
3533	lunesta	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	severe insomnia	The benefits were simple--NONE	I can't really comment on the side effects of this sleep-aid. I haven't had the pleasure of yawning.	I read carefully over the booklet and the website, thinking that maybe i was doing something wrong. I took the lunesta along the zanaflex hoping for a better result and, none!! Took it at 11pm and 3:44am, im still going strong-not even a yawn! I was formally on ambian, which would take over an hour to kick in, but my sleep time was averaging about two hours.
1297	zocor	1	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high cholesterol	lowering high cholesterol	impotence	I have a family history of high cholesterol. And I have high cholesterol as well.  In order to reduce the high cholesterol readings down to normal levels for cholesterol, my health care physician prescribed cholesterol reducing drug.  We tried Zocor for a while.  However, when taking Zocor at 10 mg per day, I experience significant problems with impotence.  I reported this to the doctor and the doctor had not receive any feedback like this before.  My prescription for high cholesterol was changed to Lipitor.
2515	motrin	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	menstrual cramps/heavey bleeding	It helped with menstrual pain and cramping due to utereine fibriods. It also slowed down heavy menstraul bleeding somewhat that was caused by the size, number and location of my uterine fibriods.	Sleepiness and increased fatigue during the day.	I took approximately 50 mg. of Motrin 2 to 4 times daily during the heaviest days of my mentrsual flow.
63	flexeril	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	muscle spasm	A muscle in my neck was pinching a nerve such that  if i turned my head or lay on that side my arm would instantly start to tingle and my hand fall asleep.  The Flexeril was effective in relaxing my muscles enough to make this merely a slight sensation within about twenty minutes, and over aperiod of one two two months the problem went away entirely.	I do not feel that I experienced any truly negative side effects or have any adverse reactions to the Flexeril.  If I was tired, the muscle relaxing effect would end up making me sleepy, and if I took it right before going to sleep it might be a little harder to wake up in the morning. But, to me it seems like that just meant it was doing what it was intended to do.	I was prescribed Flexeril (10mg) for a muscle spasm in my neck that was pinching a nerve to my right arm.  I took the ten miligrams of Flexeril three times a day for about a month as needed as it was prescribed. Then, as the symptoms lessened to the point where they only bothered me on and off, I took the ten miligrams only once or twice a day depending on how my neck felt for about another month, and finally, during the next month, I only took it when I started to feel like the symptoms might be coming back, which was maybe once or twice a week.  Since then, I have not experienced any symptoms, and it has been over a year.
1590	xanax	6	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	anxiety	When I am in highly stressful situations, I start to cry.  I took xanax at times when I knew this would happen and it worked perfectly.  I did not cry at all, my eyes didn't even water.  This has never happened with any other medication.	While the drug did give the desired effect, I was groggy and tired.  The worst side effect would be that I had short-term memory loss during when I took it.  I would see notes that I took at the time and not remember writing them and had trouble remembering the details of conversations I had at the time.	Dr. suggested I take a lower dose to decrease the side effects but when I did that, I still cried during the stressful situations.
1894	doxycycline	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	severe peridontal disease	I had   persistent periodontal problems, both stressful and painful.  Every dentist I saw  told me I was going to lose my teeth.  This drug  cleared up the condition.  It protected me against inflammation for the entire period of time that I took it.  I continued taking the drug much longer than is usually recommended because it was so effective. The effectiveness did not seem to diminish.	None.	A dentist in my dental HMO prescribed it and was willing to continue to do so because I implored him to do so.
995	armour-thyroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	much more effective than synthroid in raising body temperature, relieving fatigue, and weight loss	none	take once per day in the morning
1393	pamelor	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	This medication was greatly effective in alleviating my depression, more effective than SSRIs or SNRIs I have tried.  Also, the effects did not seem to wear off with time (over the course of treatment, 9-12 months) which I experienced with celexa and effexor xr.  The facial pain was also decreased, this medication is also used as a treatment for nerve pain.	"One of the most unfortunate side effects of all tricyclic antidepressants for many people is weight gain.  I was 'lucky' that I did not gain weight, but I was almost totally unable to lose weight despite diligent nutrition and exercise.

The medication also increased my heart rate.  I was unable to take it at night (which is the common prescribing practice) as the accelerated heart rate would keep me awake.  Taking it in the AM seemed to work around this problem but may have caused some daytime fatigue/sleepiness (this is why is it usually prescribed to be taken at night)."	I began at 10mg then worked up to a 50mg dose.  I had relatively good suppression of depressive symptoms at all doses, higher doses being better.  The higher doses did not seem to increase the weight gain/heart rate side effects any more than the lower doses (as in non-dose-dependent effects).
237	wellbutrin-xl	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/dysthymia	Wellbutrin has been very effective for my low-grade depression. I have tried many other antidepressants in the past and have found them to be ineffective and/or causing too many side effects (weight gain, sexual side effects, fatigue, etc.). Wellbutrin actually helps me maintain my weight and has minimal sexual side effects.	Side effects included mild nausea and shakiness. These side effects disappeared after about two weeks.	I have been on Wellbutrin for four years and will probably continue use for several more years.
654	seasonique	2	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	heavy periods/cramping	Prevented pregnancy	Breakthrough bleeding, headaches, extreme breast tenderness, breakouts.	I was very skeptical about taking Seasonique, because some friends of mine had taken it in the past and did not have good experiences. However, I had always experienced heavy periods and cramping, even after trying 3 different birth controls so I decided to give it a try. My doctor assured me that Seasonique was safe and I shouldn't have any severe side effects. After only a couple weeks, I started experiencing headaches and extreme breast tenderness. I didn't think much of it at first, but then I started experiencing more side effects. I have been blessed with great skin, only having a few pimples throughout my lifetime. However, after being on Seasonique for about a month, I started to notice my skin was frequently breaking out. I didn't want to stop taking birth control, so I figured I would give it a little bit longer to adjust to my body. About a month and a half into taking Seasonique, I began to breakthrough bleed. I had a full blown period for exactly 3 weeks. I consulted my doctor about a week into the period and she assured me it was totally normal. While on Seasonique, I could definitely feel significant changes in my body that were not normal for me. For these reasons, I would NOT recommend Seasonique to anyone.

The confusion, being in a daze part was the worst.  I couldn't remember where my Doctor's office was located and I live in a small town and less that two miles from his office.  My thinking cleared up as soon as I stopped taking the Seroquel.  This was an awful medication for me.	I took 200 mg at night at first.  This was then decreased to 25 mg at night to help me sleep.
1357	crestor	1	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	familial hypercholesterolaemia	"Crestor reduced my LDLC dramatically. Unfortunately there is no evidence that Crestor reduces heart attack risk or other cardiac event or reduces plaques. Stents and bypasses have not been proven to promote longevity either - merely to alleviate discomfort.

Sleep-eating, and night-time snacking.  Definitely stimulates appetite shortly (w/in 30 mins) after taking.  I do not have this side-effect with other sleep preparations.	"Take Ambien in various dosages (up and down) for primary long-standing (over 25 years) insomnia.  Have tried various drugs over the years. Better results compared with temazepam, lunesta, melatonin, lorazepam, trazadone, but stimulates appetite and ingestion of (yes, I started counting!) 300-400 extra calories at bedtime and shortly thereafter.  About 10# weight gain.  Often have had best results when dosage is high enough to induce sleep rapidly, ""skipping"" the chance to get hungry."
1567	lortab	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	severe low back pain that went down right leg.	The treatment benefits were of a great benefit to me. before i took the lortab i couldn't sleep, work, and i could barely get out of bed the pain was so severe. Before the lortab i did try the flexeril first and it didn't help, then I tried it with the Lyrica that only dulled the pain a little. Then the lortab and it helped tremendously. I started on two times a day after a month went to three and it helped to the point where i could work and I could get out of bed and do things like cut the grass or hiking and just many of other things. My overall experience were tremendous with minimal side effects!!!!!	The Side effects I experienced were minimal such as dizzyness, or lightheaded but addding a little food before my dose would most of time cure the side effects.	I was diagnosed with a disc problem that was pinching my nerves in low back. My Sciatica was being pinched by the disc causing my leg to hurt really bad and numbness and tingling were involved. I started taking flexeril first and it by itself wasn't helping. Then i was put on lyrica 2 times daily with the flexerill and it dulled the pain but not much. After that i really didn't want nothing that strong but the pain was severe so the doc put me on lortab 2 times daily to start with and 3 times daily the next month and that helped tremendously. I did physicall therapy for about three months. and now i have minimal back pain and i can function like a normall 20 year old.
579	acyclovir	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hsv 2	Since this was an initial diagnosis of HSV 2 I do not know how effective it was as I have nothing to compare it to.  It is supposed to keep HSV 2 from erupting on the skin's surface or if it already has, it is supposed to reduce the duration of the lesions.	"I experienced very noticeable hair loss when washing my hair.  It seemed to go away after about 2 weeks, but this could also be when I lowered my daily total dose from 1200mg to 800mg.
When I again started taking 1200mg total per day, my hair loss seems to have returned."	"I was prescribed acyclovir for an initial diagnosis of HSV 2.  Initially one is supposed to take it 400mg 3x daily for 10 days.  I then chose to continue taking acyclovir as part of a ""suppressive therapy"" regimen.  At this time the dosing decreased to 400mg 2x daily."
1845	yasmin	1	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	birth control	By taking Yasmin I did not get pregnant, as it did act as a proper birth control method.  However the side effects outweighed the benefits and I was forced to switch to a new form of birth control. I would NEVER recommend this type of birth control.	Severe depression, mood swings, weight gain, longer period, yeast infections, and numerous other effects.	1 pill daily for 21 days and then a week break.

My Dermatologist prescribed Tri-Luma cream to lighten the spots and also said it would help redice the appearance of my wrinkles.	A few days after use my skin started peeling where I had been using the cream. The cream had an unpleasant odor.	After pregnancy my upper lip remainedmarked with dark spots - melasma. My Dermatologist prescribed Tri-Luma cream to lighten the spots and also said it would help redice the appearance of my wrinkles. I used the cream each night. The texture was thick and the smell was not appealing. A few days after use my skin started peeling where I had been using the cream. The peeling was annoying as I would constantly have to put moisturizer on to stick the skin back down. After a month of dilligent nightly usage I did not notice a lightening of my dark spots nor any reduction in my wrinkles.  Perhaps with continued use my spots would have lightened but honestly, I couldn't stand walking around with skin peels hanging off my face. The Dr should have advised me about the peeling. I was very dissappointed as this prescription cream cost $100.
3903	nexium	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	gerd	Prior to taking Nexium I had continuous GERD.  I took every type of antacid over the counter.  In addition I had more episodes of Asthma and cystitis.  Whenever I had extreme heartburn I would also get the other 2 problems mentioned above.	I have not had any side effects with this medicine, however I worry about it's long-term use and possible future side effects.	I was first prescribed this medicine by my family practitioner.

3073	emsam	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	major chronic depressive disorder	I had become so severly depressed that I was incapable of holding a job.  My doctor had tried virtually all classifications of meds on the market but none were able to pull me out of the state I was in.  My world had become so dark I felt the sun would never shine again.  This med allowed me to function again within my family and within the working world.  I stopped crying all the time and was able to concentrate and perform the tasks necessary for employment.  I got my life back.	Unlike other antidepressants with numerous side effects, this med had no internal side effects.  The only complaint I had with this med was the skin irritation at the application site.  This I treated with moisturizers and hydrocortisone creams.	"I simply applied one patch daily to any part of the ""trunk"" area of my body.  It was not a drug I had to be introduced to slowly or weaned off of.  I found that the lowest dose available was effective for me.  Each day before my shower the previous days patch was removed so the site area could be cleansed.  After my shower the new patch was applied in a different location."
3791	keflex	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	post operative antibiotic	Prevention of post surgical infection and peace of mind following my minor outpatient surgery.	The mild side effects I experienced included fatigue and the abdominal bloating and intestinal tract upset that commonly accompanies any antibiotic treatment.  It would be helpful if the Patient Education information sheet included commentary about this phenomenon and instructions regarding using yogurt or supplements to prevent digestive difficulties.	The Patient Education information sheet mentioned hives and rash as potential side effects when taking this medication.  As a person who is allergic to dyes and food colorings, (a red, itching, burning, eczema like rash results when I ingest these additives) I find it unnecessary that the gel cap in which this medication is contained would have to be colored green or colored at all for that matter.  In order to avoid this unpleasant side effect, I opened each gel cap just prior to taking it, poured the medication out onto a spoon and swallowed it down as quickly as possible.  My surgical results were excellent and I did not experience any symptoms of infection.

4008	celexa	5	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	For the depression it didn't make much of a difference; but it worked wonders for my anxiety. The edginess, nervousness, impatience, fear of socializing and going out of the house, completely disappeared after one month of taking it. My close friends even commented that 'I was my old self again'. I was much more relaxed and happy. It made me realize that I was misdiagnosed as depressed, when what I really have is anxiety. After talking to my new psiquiatrist, we came to that conclusion.	COMPLETE loss of libido. That's why I discontinued the treatment.	I started with 10mg/day, for one month, when I started to feel less anxious, but not motivated or more energetic, as expected from an anti-depressive medication. Then the dose went up to 20mg/day for another 3- 4 months, when no 'anti-depression' effects were noticed, the dose went up to 30 mg/day, it made no difference either. I have stopped taking it gradually (20mg/day for 1 week, then 10mg/day for 3 weeks) until i stopped completely. Now I'm waiting to see how I feel, to see if I 'll try another medication, since the side effect described above was intolerable to me.
2993	sulfasalazine	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	crohn's disease	None (see next entry).	Before I started using the drug I had none of the classic symptoms of Crohn's Disease (loose bowel movements, abdominal pain, etc.), but these side effects started when I started taking the drug, and subsided when I stopped. Also, I developed other side effects while using the drug, including low-level nausea, loss of appetite and headaches.	I started off on a dose of 1 x 500 mg enteric-coated tabs four times daily (the doctor's recommended test dose to see if I responded negatively to the drug), but when I tried to increase this to 2x 500 mg tabs four times daily after one week, the side effects I had been experiencing increased, so I dropped back. I tried one more time to increase the dose more gradually (2 x 500 mg in the morning; then 1 x 500 mg at lunch, dinner and bedtime), but even this became too unpleasant to put up with (especially since I didn't have these symptoms before I started!). I perservered for 6 weeks, before deciding to taper the dose to zero over a couple of weeks, after which the symptoms disappeared.

My glacoma was hard to diagnose because the cornea was thicker than the norm and the normal puff test gave incorrect readings for several years. I had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2002 when my weight had reached 397 poounds.  I had also been diagnosed with adult onset asthma when we moved to Oregon in the early 90's.  With the type 2 diabetes, my Dr recommended that I consider gastric bypass surgery which was done at OHSA, Portland OR in October 2002.  My A1c tests started showing normal in 6 months and have remained so since then.  My Dr in Portland had told me to always get my eyes checked by an Opthamologist because of the long term effects of the asthma drugs I had been taken as well as diabetes."

4127	chantix	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	to help quit smoking cigarettes	"I was able to quit smoking 2 1/2 yrs ago.  I had smoked 2 1/2 packs of menthols for 35 years.  No one,including me, thought I could ever quit.  The Chantix kept me from feeling any withdrawal from nicotine and made it so smoking didn't give me the ""boost"" it had.  There became no point in smoking.  I kept the last prescription to take ""PRN' when in certain situations.  It also took a little mental work."	Only one I noticed was waking up feeling like I'd had bad dreams.  I didn't realize it was a side effect until reading about it later.  A few bad dreams was well worth the results.	"You take 1/2 dose pills for maybe a week in the starter pack.  Then move to full strength.  Take 1 in the morning and one in the evening or late day.  Try to establish a ""quit"" day before starting.  I didn't.  I used it for 2-3 weeks while I tapered down and worked on the psychological aspects.  After 2 days of only having 1 cig a day, I stopped.  After 4 months, my insurance no longer paid.  I needed longer and paid full price.  I used my last box PRN.  When I'd be in an evening situation where I thought it might be difficult, I'd take one a few hours before going and it would work.  Taking only 1 in the daytime did NOT result in the bad dreams.

400	lantus	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	insulin dependent diabetes mellitus	I experienced markedly improved fasting blood glucose levels, and greater stability of blood sugar before and after meals.  I had found with other treatment options, such as the insulin pump and the nph insulins that my morning blood sugars were always high, even with increased dosages.	The only side effects were increased weight gain and increased hypoglycemia in the late evenings/early mornings.  The side effect is because Lantus has a 22 hour duration after injection and as a result whenever I experience a greater than usual amount of activity, my insulin sensitivity increases dramatically.	"Treatment consisted of a morning and evening dose of lantus split up as 30 units in the evening and 15 units in the morning.  It took approximately two years of playing with the dosage amounts to find this as the ""best fit"" as all dosages either resulted in extremely low evening blood sugars or extremely high morning blood sugars.  Also, changes in activity result in severe blood sugar swings as well."

These symptoms were noticed on 5/21, about 7 weeks into the treatment, but the condition not diagnosed as an allergic reaction until 6/10. By that time it had spread to 70% of the body, on the torso, back, and legs. The diagnosing physician suspected the terbinafine, and the patient immediately stopped taking the drug.

Complete loss of focus and concentration. Extreme forgetfulness. Inability to structure sentences properly.  Very emotional, which is highly uncharacteristic of me.	While the medicine was successful in treating both seizures and migraines, being a college student the side effects became too unbearable to continue the medication.

Also my eyes still itched.  My throat also itched.	I suffered from a dry throat, sore throat, and stuffy nose.  My nose seemed to get too dry.  But it still felt congested.  It just didn't run as much.  Also, my bronchial tubes had a hard time dilating at times and I wheezed.

I took the pills every morning and night, about twelve hours apart between doses.  the medication did not keep me awake or make me jittery. The medication also did not make me drowsy like some other allergy medications.  The medication, however, did not always relieve my symptoms.  I ultimately tried another medication to see if I could get better results.  I also had to use an inhaler for wheezing since the medication did not help that symptom.

3183	desyrel	1	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	insomnia	I did sleep reliably and without waking up in the middle of the night	gradually got more and more sedated during the day.  I functioned as though my IQ had dropped about 30 points.  It kinda dumbed me down until I was screwing up at work--forgetting details, working slowly, not able to focus, etc.  Also, I became very unassertive--not like me at all. When I realized what was happening, I went off it--and had a significant withdrawal reaction--shaking, extremely anxious, really weird.  The withdrawal reaction subsided in a couple of days.	"I was prescribed this drug for insomnia.  My MD told me that it had been used as an anti-depressant, but didn't work well for that, but was good for insomnia.  She originally prescribed 25 mg, and suggested I work up from that if 25 was ineffective.  I am very drug sensitive, so when 25 mg. really knocked me out and I could barely wake up the next day, I cut the pills in half, and that seemed to work--but I just gradually got the effects mentioned above.  I realized later that I had taken the same drug, higher dose, under the name Desyrel when I was 43 for post partum depression.  It didn't work, and it made my blood pressure go down--the number I remember is 77/44.  Same reaction--very sedated, confused, etc.  I would never have taken it, but it was not identified as Desyrel, even on the pharmacy information sheet, so I didn't realize what it was.  The weird thing about this drug (for me) is that it makes me so confused, but subtly, that I can't think clearly enough to realize what is happening until it gets pretty bad.  I know I am very sensitive, and this may be a completely idiosyncratic reaction, but I don't think so.  When I talked to the pharmacist about it she said ""Yeah, some people just can't take it.""

went away after taking the amoxicillin after a day.  I am continuing to take it to make sure the infection goes away."	I didnt have any side effects to the treatment.	I was told to take amoxicillin 3x day /claritin/ motrin and did all those things and seemed to work fine.
3142	tylenol	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	headache	Actually symptoms dissapeared almost within 15-20 min after taking medication, making it easy to continue with your normal day activities, even if that includes gym or an outdoor activity.

3415	aricept	2	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	alzheimer's	There seemed to be some mild improvement in alertness once he went onto the stronger (10 mg) version of the pill. There was no noticeable improvement in mood which was a disappointment.	He had fairly severe nausea, diarrhea and cramps almost immediately after switching to the higher does of Aricept. The side effects were so severe, the medication had to be discontinued.	He started out with the introductory dose (5 mg) and then graduated to the full dose (10 mg). When the side effects became a problem, he was put back down to the introductory dose, but the side effects continued, and we saw no real benefits from the drug. (We recently switched him to the Namenda patch which he seems to be tolerating.)
449	lorazepam	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety	I found that the benefits of this drug were marginal at best. My heart rate decreased and I felt slightly less anxious but I still had a feeling of unease especially during social situations. Social situations felt only barely tolerable.  Though symptoms were minimized slightly it wasn't worth the side effects.	The symptoms I had were one of feeling spacey, dizzy and slightly nauseous and I couldn't take these at work where I felt the most anxiety. These symptoms seemed to last what felt like quite a while at least 2 to 3 hours after taking them but in all honesty most anti anxiety and depression meds have little positive effect.	Treatment consisted of seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist and all though the psychologist was marginally helpful I eventually turned to meditation and found a lot more relief than through medication and talk therapy.The psychiatrist tried to help me changing dosage and medication every couple of months but I never felt much relief.
2919	tramadol	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	osteochondral injury of the talus, left ankle	I had no benefits from this medication, if anything it added more problems for me. It never once relieved my pain in my ankle. Darvacet helped my ankle more then this medication. Even though I was switching because Darvacet was losing its effectiveness it would have been tons better to stay on Darvacet for all the bad Tramadol did for me.	My whole body ached I had severe stomachaches and headaches. I turned into a zombie all I did was stare at the wall. It would make me dizzy and at times I wouldn't know where I was at. I was scared to be on it, but I wasn't in my right mind to be able to take myself off of it. I took a blade one night and slashed both my arms up and hid the fact that I did it. I started to take myself off the medication. When I was able to think straight I admitted to people I know what I had done to my arms. Other then my ankle pain I felt 100% better off of Tramadol. I believe that if I were to stay on Tramadol I would have done something much worse. Since being off of this medication I realize how that person then wasn't me. That scared me more then anything ever. Doctor's need to monitor patients much more closely on Tramadol. I can't imagine that there are a lot of people with my reaction to it but I can't imagine even one other person having an adverse reaction like I did.	I had an ankle accident at a job. I had this injury for a long time.There isn't much that can be done for it. So I will be on pain medication for the rest of my life. I had taken Darvacet for about 6 years before it lost its effectiveness. Tramadol was only the second pain medication I had ever tried. My doctor thought it would help me. I had never heard about it before. I never once thought I would have such a bad reaction to it. After taking almost 8 Darvacet a day I was ready to try anything else. I just wish for people to be very careful with Tramadol I don't want anyone else going through what I did.

My throat and neck hurt so back and it felt like i had strained it or pulled a muscle. My train of thought was messed up and I could not concentrate or form full comprehensive sentences. There was nothing I could do so I just waited it out, towards the end (nearly 4 hours later) I tried eating and my salivary glands went crazy! I felt like I was drinking and eating scalding hot food, it was crazy! I will NEVER take that again. I called my doctor and she moved me immediately to MAXALT, IT IS GREAT, I LOVE IT. I have other allergies so it is no surprise to me that I had a reaction, but the severity was shocking. Don't settle for a medication that makes you feel only half good.

Side effects are not a big deal..

But even so after your body becomes adjusted to Zoloft, that side effects eventually just leaves.	Well I went to see a doctor and talked about my situation, and for the first three visit, she just talked to me, then after the 3rd visit, she decided it would be a good idea to put me on Zoloft.

I was give another same perscription and kept taking it, then my doctor wouldn't give me any more, even though it was showing improvement.  So, I found that I could order it online, and it directed me to take 1600 mg during outbreaks, so I did.  And it started healing, and now after almost a month it's almost gone.  This cold sore didn't break the surface, but was getting larger so this medication was a life saver.	Slight headache, in the scalp area and forhead, but very slight.	Instead of taking the whole 800 mg tablet, I took 400mg (half) then the other half about an hour or so later.  So, 1600 mg a day was very effective, and work miraculously.

Switched to Seasonique since there are hormones in the last week of pills which my doctor thought might reduce headaches.  Nope.  After the first three months I had my period and had the same terrible migraines.  I gave it three more months but had the same results.  The good news?  Not pregnant.

Though no other drugs were taken to address the infection, the prescribed drug did alleviated the pain until the condition improved. Eventually a root canal was performed and I received a second prescription.	The only noticeable side effect was that I became drowsy when taking the drug and  had to lay down throughout the day.  As I was unable to work under these conditions,  I did not have to perform usual task, therefore it is hard to measure what I would or would not have been able to do while taking the pain killer.	I went to my dentist complaining of immense pain and swelling in my jaw area.  An x-ray was performed and nothing could be detected.  However, due to my symptoms, Hydrocodone/Ibuprofen was prescribed.  I was sent home with a follow up visit  scheduled.  The swelling and pain decreased within a few days, I discontinued taking the drug and I was able to continue normal activities.  However, approximately a week later the symptoms returns and I returned to dentist.  This time the x-ray revealed a need for a root canal.

1569	lortab	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	oral surgery	As having surgery, my mounth experienced excruiating pain. I was without them for 3 hours. These seemed like the worst day of my life. After taking the pills I noticed one of two things occured. One, the pain was gone soon after taking them. Two, I became extremely tired. First I thought that it was only like this because I just had surgery, but no. It seemed as though everytime I taken a pill I needed a nap soon after. Don't get me wrong, I would rather have a nap and be painless then to be awake throughout the entire day and experience that pain. This stayed this way for the entire time that I was on Lortab.	Major drowsiness. Every time a took the pills, it made me extremely sleepy. This made me unable to drive, do heavy activies, or even hold a conversation. Also, if I taken the pill when I have had nothing to eat for a while, it seem to make me sick for a short period of time, roughly 30 mintues up to a hour and a half. I never became dizzy or anything else.	"The pill did wonders for the pain. When I took them I recieved results within 10-20mins. They also lasted a moderate amount of time to deal with the pain as well. They do become somewhat ""addicting"". So I tried to take 1000 - 1200mg of Ibuprofen to compensate for the Lortab. However, when your in a lot of pain, Ibuprofen just doesnt to seem to deliever the results that Lortab could provide."

After I stopped taking the Lipitor, most of the pain stopped.  The muscle pain is gone, but some of the joint pain has continued.	The doctor perscribed the Lipitor for my high cholesterol.

804	ambien	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	difficulty sleeping	Most nights I am able to fall asleep within about 20 minutes, sleep through the night, and wake feeling refreshed.  I do not feel any residual tiredness or sluggishness during the day.	If I take 10mg I occasionally experience a mild headache the next day, so I usually take about 7.5mg.  Other than that, no side effects except that I have said and done things that I don't remember.  This is not a problem is I just go to bed after taking it.	"I take about 3/4 of a 10mg tablet about 20 to 30 minutes before I go to bed.  It is best if I then just go to bed, but I often stay up until it ""kicks in."""

936	levaquin	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	cellulitis (skin infection on my leg)	None	Severe dizziness and nausea	I went to Dr because it looked like a wound on my leg from a scrap was getting infected.  He prescribed Levaquin for 10 days.  I only took one tablet and within 2 hours I felt very lightheaded and nauseaus.  I actually had to lay down and have someone call the doctor for me.  They told me to quit taking it and put me on Cefadroxil (generic for Duricef) instead.  I tolerated that fine.  Levaquin is a very expensive antibiotic and now I'm stuck with the cost of that.  They should just give it out in 1-2 tablet doses first to see if you can tolerate it before you get a full 10 day supply.

3842	voltaren	3	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	primary dysmenorrhea	Hardly any- it was much less effective than paracetamol against the pain. I still had to take the maximum dose of ibuprofen to reduce the pain. I hoped taking Voltaren as well would extend the analgesic effects of the ibuprofen but it was fairly ineffective.	None	75 mg Voltaren & 2.4g ibuprofen a day during periods of extreme pain
1150	byetta	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	diabetic	This  slows the sugar going into my system so that my body can use most of my own insulin to process the sugar.  It is to be taken along with the metformin. It has helped control my blood sugar very well.	It can sometimes cause nausea. At the start of treatment it was bad but now it only happens if I miss a dose then the next one will cause nausea.  The first couple of months I saw a very slight drop in weight but I am not sure if the Byetta caused this.	I take a shot before my first meal and last meal each day.  It is a very easy shot to give to myself but it is easy to forget if I eat out or if I am traveling.
1628	premarin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	radical hysterectomy	I have only been taking it 2 weeks but it so far eliminated my night sweats and hot flashes and in just 2 weeks I have noticed my skin looks and feels like I am 20 again my slight wrinkles on my face vanished almost overnight I look and feel younger.

There was an increase  of hair growth of the front hair line, but it was not substantial. My hair also grew at a faster rate than normal.	the side effects of taking finasteride 2.5mg per day for six month period were feeling dehydrated, having dry mouth. Especially in the morning. I also experienced a lower libido than normal. I also experienced a lower level of energy throught the day. the side effects were not extreme and did go away after discontinuing the treatment.	The treatment details were the oral intake of finasteride. I obtained it in the 5mg form known as proscar. I would cut the tablet in half to get a 2.5mg dosage. I took 2.5mg of finasteride every day at night before i went to sleep. If i missed a dosage i waited for the next day to take the next dosage. Taking the whole 5mg dosage per day in my opinion would be to high a dosage. The side effects would increase.

The next day I was still shaky and dizzy, but not as bad as the day before. I remained nauseous, shaky, and dizzy for the remainder of the treatment.

Also, let your work know you are on this so they expect a change in you during your treatment. Take with food because the taste is awful.	500 mg, three times a day for seven days.
2516	motrin	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis	This treatment helped with my rheumatoid arthritis as I had decided not to take any stronger drugs anymore.  I attribute my being able to function on just one a day to my taking of many supplements, i.e. fish oils, MSM, Vit C, E and so forth.  I also do Tai Chi and try to stay as active as I can.  So far, so good!!	I have had no side effects; I'm lucky that way.	I started off with one 600 mg tablet 3X a day and am now down to 1 a day.
586	acyclovir	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	recurrent colds	drug was prescribed for off label use to treat recurrent infections by physician whose protocol addresses high viral load in limbic system (chicken pox) and GI tract (MMR vaccine remnants).  It seemed to work - could be that other environmental variables were removed simultaneously but I can't think of variables that were exactly concurrent with taking of this drug.

160	zomig	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraines	Before when I had a migraine headache I used to be in agony for at least 48 hours. I would have to go to bed because the pain was so bad. I could hardly see and my stomach would be so upset that I would be sick to my stomach. Nothing that I tried ever worked. With the zomig, usually within 1-2 hours and sometimes less I would have tota relief of my migraine headache.	I had no treatment side effects.	It was recommended that as soon as I felt the migraine coming on that I take a zomig tablet. The one that I take is the rapimelt that I put under my tongue and it melts usually in less than a minute. I find that I usually het relief within in 1 -2 hours.

interest in daily activities, passive suicidal ideation, loss of energy."	"the treatment resulted in augmentation of restless legs and induced weekly migraines. this required three additional medication to manage the side effects.
these medications also had side effects."	"the treatment was started two years ago and was intially very effective.
despite causing augmentation of restless legs and inducing weekly migraines
a decision was to stay on the medication and treat the side effects. over
time the antidepressant effects waned but the side effects continued so I
am slowly being withdrawn from the effexor. the seroquel has had side effects
as well."
2814	wellbutrin	5	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	More energy, better mood, increase sexual desire (which was very low).	I had a moderate tinnitus which became severe as soon as I started to take the drug. I will stop taking the medication.	I've been taking Duloxetina (Cymbalta) 60mg for 2 years now. It helps with my mood but it doesn't take all the depression sympthoms away.
1926	zithromax	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	ear infection and upper respiratory infection	Ear pain decreased on the third day.  Ear pain was gone by the day 5. Both infections went away on the 6th day.  This drug worked as expected and the results were remarkable.	I did not experience any adverse side effects from the zithromax.  I was experiencing fatigue, nausia, sleeping problems and other typical flu or cold symptoms, but I think that was mostly due to the infections not the zithromax.	I took the zithromax for 5 days, once a day with two dosages on the first day just as prescribed.  I rested for the first three days and experienced a great improvment in my condition.
3182	desyrel	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insomia	"I can not shut my mind down to go to sleep.  I will lay there and think of thing after thing and cannot ""shut down."" I originally took ambien for insomia, but my insurance would not fully cover the prescription and it was too expensive to take nightly.  My doctor put me on trazadone as a safe, low cost alternative.  I take 1/3 to 1/2 of a trazadone each night. I vary the dosage, depending on how ""excitable"" I feel that day. It takes roughly 20 minutes to one half of an hour to take effect.  If I don't go directly to bed after taking it, if I stay up watching tv or reading, when I start to feel the effects I give in and go to bed immediately.  I have got into doing something and fought it off before and sometimes you can overcome it, but another time I accidently took it with my morning vitamines and was not able to go to work.  I had to go back to bed!  I love the drug and since I tend to be high strung anyway, I am sure that I am receiving multiple benefits from trazadone."	"I have had none of the side effects listed except for the ""may cause drowziness"" which is the whole reason I am taking trazadone."	I take 1/3 to 1/2 of a tablet each night about 20 to 30 minutes before going to bed.
863	valium	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	low back pain/herniated disk/sciatic pain	The immediate benefits were the relaxing, pain free life I am now experiencing. I am not sure how long it will last, but I will take the relief for now. I have suffered with terrible back pain for going on 8 years, and until I was prescribed valium and Norco combination, I was still in excruciating pain. The combo eases the muscle spasms and basically stops all pain in my lower back. When I awake, I am hurting, but within 20 minutes of taking meds, I am my old, 25 year old self again.	I have experienced NO side effects other than feeling high, a little off-balance, and sleepy. I actually take the Valium at work and have had NO problems whatsoever,	I am very happy with my doctors prescribed meds, and hope Valium continues to work for me in the same manner it has so far. I would highly recommend this combo for anyone having back pain or anxiety. As I live and work a very hectic job, the Valium effects are a plus to keep me on an even keel, allowing me to do my work with a more mellow attitude.
956	diovan	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	For over a period of several years my blood pressure has gone down and has stayed down. Follow up visits to the doctor have proven to be much better when blood pressure was checked. The doctor has recommended that I stay on this product and along with exercise should be highly effective.	The side effects of Diovan were so minimal I cannot detect them; however, I cannot take the Diovan HCT because it messes up my eletrolytes and I get leg and foot cramps. I try to follow dosage instructions which recommends that this pill be taken at night before going to bed, if possible.	The treatment with Diovan is very simple. One pill at night before going to bed.The reason for that is most people's blood pressure increases at night and many people die in their sleep at night because of high blood pressure. The problem I have is that the pills get stuck in my throat and I have to eat something like a grape or anything really that will help the pill go down.It does not seem to keep me awake at night which is good.
3851	voltaren	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	osteoarthritis	Severe debilitating pain  associated with inflammation and joint pain through out the body is alleviated, enabling more normal living.  eg being able to do all housework tasks, gardening, running around and picking up grandchildren, enjoying social life plus taking part in daily fitness activities.	occaional stomach pains	Always only take the medication with meals so as to minimize the likelihood of the stomach being affected.
1339	tegretol	1	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	seizures	No seizures	Sever diarrhea, abdominal pain	After increasing dosing frequency to twice daily, abdominal cramping and then severe diarrhea, medication had to be stopped.
1226	ultracet	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	post surgery	Analgesic post surgery without use of codeine (patient has allergy).	Mild constipation	While I found the medication moderately effective for pain relief, I seemed to build up a tolerance to it quickly, so that it had a progressively less pronounced effect over the course of a few days. Pro: patient may be less likely to become dependent on the drug if it is taken as prescribed, because the effect tapers off. Con: Not useful as a long-term pain reducer because patient may eventually start taking more than the prescribed dosage to achieve pain relief.
1222	prozac	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Perfect.  The Trazadone helps me sleep inspite of the Prozac.  I no longer have any manic phases thanks to Lamictal.	None	I started with the Prozac.  Then the trazadone was added to help me sleep.  I was always cycling into manic phases but they became more extreme and serious.  The Lamictal completely obliterated the mania.  I feel completely stable, happy and am very high functioning.
2691	prinivil	2	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	high blood pressure	Has brought BP down to 128/85	(never had any of these sympton prior to taking the drug. Swelling in my knee and ankles (it comes and goes not as much as the first year, very tired all the time, out of breath walking at times, weight gain 45LBS first year on drug, significant increase in sinus infections, constant clear drainage down the back of my throat to the point where it chokes me at night because it backs up in my throat.  The gagging cough makes me feel like I�m going to vomit at times and my throat always feels swollen. Voice became hoarse then most recently lost it for three weeks; when throat is swollen have a throat cough that sounds like a seal. Intermittent dizziness and more recently longer periods lasting up to weeks at a time.  Ear ringing and head feels stuffy more often then not.	I'm going to see a new doctor and insist I be taken off this medication.  My entire quality of life has decreased since starting this drug.  It starts very slow but the longer I have been on it the worse the symptoms have become.  I think it becomes more toxic with time.
3625	retin-a	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	fine wrinkles	The benefits were smoother, more evenly-colored skin. I have no deep wrinkles. I developed no blemishes and I tended to stay out of the sun since it makes skin photo-sensitive. I am mistaken for being younger than my age, however, whether it's heredity or product, I'll never know for sure.	Photo-sensitive to the sun. In the beginning, a burning sensation. Not to be used around mouth  area.	I used the Retin-A at night and a regular moisturizer during the daytime.
608	minocin	7	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acne	I have been struggling with adult acne. A dermatologist prescribes the Minocycline and for the first two months, it worked great. I had perfectly clear skin AND I noticed that my hair STOPPED falling out at it's normal rate. All the women in my family start losing their hair starting in their thirties and by the time they are 60, wigs are definitely in order. Also, I normally get tonsil stones. These also ceased.	No major side effects other than it stopped working for my acne after two months so I stopped taking it.  The acne has become worse than ever.  The hair loss returned although at a somewhat diminished rate than pre-Minocycline. The one remaining benefit is that the tonsil stones have not returned. It has been approximately one month since I discontinues use of the antibiotic.	"Originally, the dermatologist prescribed that I take the antibiotic for two months. I finished the course and the acne started to come back. At that time, I went to see my GP and she said, ""If it's working, keep taking it for up to the next 6 mos. to a year."" Against my better judgment, I took the Minocycline for another two months. The efficacy obviously diminished over time and did not solve the root problem, whatever it may be."
164	zomig	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraine	getting rid of a migraine after years of suffering. Have lost count of the ruined parties, weddings, holiday days etc before a friend recommended this tablet to me. To me it is simply a magic pill.	None	I take one 2.5mg tablet, usually after suffering for a few hours. (I like to make sure because I don't want to waste them on an ordinary headache!) After about 90 minutes the migraine has gone.
2167	zyrtec	5	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	allergies	Controlled allegies very well	When Zyrtec became over the counter and sold this medicine, something was changed in the formula which caused severe hair loss.  After a long process of elimination to find out the cause I stopped Zyrtec and my hair came back.  This also happened to my teenage daughter.	I took Zyrtec for many years without adverse reaction.  Only when it became OTC did the problem begin.
1046	vyvanse	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	adhd	Very concentrated , very alert , Euphoria , more done in less time , sociable , energetic .	Insomnia , mood swings , worse anxiety and depression , loss of appetite to the point were I forget to eat , extreme iriablility after it wears off , and extreme attacks of anger.	Vyvanse is a new medication used to treat ADHD. It is a time-released capsule. It is easy to swallow (no bad taste like pressed pills), and does not upset your stomach. The pill releases the drug slowly, so ur not hit with all of it at one time. This allows for the medicine to be equally effective all day, not just for a few hours. Since Vyvanse is new, there is no generic for it.
3664	effexor-xr	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Effexor was very effective at alleviating my symptoms of depression.  My mood improved dramatically, I felt happy and engaged in life again.  It also worked fairly quickly.  I began feeling the effects within the first week.	The side effects I experienced while taking Effexor were insomnia, rapid heartbeat and grinding my teeth at night.  Also, I found myself incessantly jiggling my leg while sitting at my desk, watching tv, etc..  All in all, these were minor and as easy trade-off.  The major side effect I noticed was a complete loss of libido and inability to reach orgasm.  Simply put, it was as if a switch had been turned off on my sex drive.  This side effect was the reason I chose to stop taking Effexor.	"My physician started me out on 37.5mg/day for 1 week then increased the dosage to 75mg/day for another week and, finally, to 150mg/day.  After taking 150mg/day for about a week, I felt it was too much...my heart was always racing, I couldn't sleep, and I generally just felt ""nervous"".  My physician dropped my dosage back to 75mg/day and that seemed to work best for me.  I absolutely feel that the Effexor helped lift my depression.  However, I eventually chose to stop taking it because of the sexual side effects.  After being on Effexor for about a year, I both wanted and needed to have a healthy sexual relationship with my husband again.  I dropped the dosage back to 37.5mg/day for a week, then one every other day for about another week before stopping altogether.  I don't recall having any ""withdrawal"" symptoms.  Within a few days of the last dose, all sexual functions were back."
1990	vicodin	3	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	pain	None - No pain relief	Vomiting and dehydration	My doctor switched me to another pain reliever which worked.
2680	prinivil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high bloodpressure	No fluctuation anymore. Normal bloodpressure ever since	I have been taking this medecine for nearly ten years and haven't had any side effects that I am aware of.	One daily dose of 30mg at night, never skipping a day. I go 3 to 4 times a year to my hypertension ist for checkups.
4031	tri-luma	8	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	hyperpigmentation	lightening of acne scars	redness, dryness, breakdown of skin	this topical compound was used to reduce hyperpigmentation of skin.  the medication was suggested for nightly use but the adverse effects were too intense, and the drug could not be tolerated but few times per week for the duration of 8 weeks.
3629	retin-a	4	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	sun damage	The benefits were a very gradual reduction in the appearance of sun spots on the skin. The spots themselves never disappeared but lightened over a period of time. The general appearance of the skin also improved slightly but it did not prevent new spots from appearing as I noticed that they did, although I suspect that the cream probably kept them lighter than they would have been. Discontinuation did make the darkness come back into the sun spots after about 4 to 6 months however.	There were really no side effects; perhaps the tiniest of tingling at the ery first couple of applications then none after.	"Topical application of the cream daily, usually at night. The recommended amount was ""pea sized"" but I found it too thick to get this amount to massage into the whole face."
329	ativan	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	extremely severe anxiety	ALL my anxiety, stress, were gone. I also have Tourette's Syndrome, which is a neurological disorder which causes me to have involentary movements and sounds that I have no controll over, (tics.) And once I started taking this medicine, the tics were such at the minimum, i used to have 50-100 tics a day, now i have 3-4 tics all because of Lorazepam. This might be a very good treatment for others with Tourette's Syndrome!!	I feel very tired and i have a hard time focusing in class. But I think once i start getting used to this medication the focusing will come back.	I have been suffering from anxiety for such a long time. I felt as if my life was not living for anymore, but once i started this medicine, everything changed. Even though this is the first day i am taking it, it has done a great and good impact on me today, 4-26-11.
2023	protonix	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	effective in helplng to control acid reflux	none that i know of at the present time.But i donot know what damage it has done if any to any of my internal orgins	One tablet once a day
2541	lamisil	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	toenail fungus	I just finished my 90 day course and am seeing great benefits.  My toenails are finally growing out thin and clear.  I didn't start to see any major changes in my toenails until around the two month mark.  I told myself I would be one of the people who comes back to review the product because the positive reviews I read are what got me through those first few weeks when all of the negative side effects were flashing through my head.  It has definitely been worth it to take the pills.  I can't wait for a few more months to go by where my toenails will be completely  be grown out and I will feel confident about going and getting the first pedicure of my life.  Also very much looking forward to sandal season next year.	For the first few days I definitely had some diarrhea but it wasn't that bad.  Maybe some mild stomach cramping within that period too.  But I ate some yogurt with it before I took it at bedtime which helped curb any intestinal issues.  All of this went away within a week or two of taking it.  I also experienced some cotton mouth feeling and that lasted pretty much the whole time.  It wasn't too bad but noticeable.  I never had any taste disturbances.	I took one pill a day, at night for 90 days with a big glass of water and never skipped a dose.  I had a few nights where I had some wine and champagne but never overdid it and tried to steer clear of alcohol as much as possible.
2559	inderal	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	situational anxiety	I've used 40mg Inderal for situational anxiety a few times per month over the past 6 years. I found it to be very effective when taken 30min to 1hr prior to public speaking, large social gatherings, dates, and other anxiety provoking situations. It really helps decrease signs of nervousness resulting from the fight-or-flight response, such as increased heart rate, sweaty palms, and dry mouth.	none	as above
4053	amoxil	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	kidney infection	treatment benefits of using amoxicillin for the infection proved to be substantial. My infection diminished progressively over the course of a week taking the prescribed dosage each day, I also noticed that the infection never reoccurred and has not since. Overall taking amoxil was not nearly unpleasant as I thought it would have been and it did the job I was told it would do	side effects of treatment very rarely occurred and were minimal, however when I did experience side effects they were as follows : nausea, headache, stomach pain, dizziness, and loss of appetite.	I was told to take 3 500 mg pills a day over the course of a 7 day period in order to completely and effectively banish the infection, I felt comfortable with this decision and it turned out positive results in the end.
1439	tirosint	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	low thyroid	I had experienced decreased energy and increasing tiredness for several years.  It got to the point I was taking naps for the first time since I was a small child, and still didn't feel refreshed.  I also felt cold frequently and had put on a good 20 pounds in a year.  When I went for my annual physical, my blood work came back with high cholesterol for the first time.  I thought it was advancing middle age.  Fortunately, my MD put it all together and ordered a thyroid test.  I was very low.  Within two weeks, I felt energized and my mood improved.  I have shed some (not all, darn it) of the weight and my cholesterol score is lower.	I had none except for a few hot flashes (well past menopause) that went away in the first few weeks.  I have never been a pill-taker for fear of side effects, but this was a good experience.  Fortunately, the initial dose was effective and did not need adjustment.	As I said, my doctor spotted the symptoms and ordered a thyroid test.  When it came back very low, she prescribed 75 mg a day of levothyroxine, and I felt a little better almost immediately.  Within 2 weeks, I felt younger, more energy, better mood and my weight gain stopped.  I have enough energy to exercize and with only a slight shift in my fairly healthy diet to less fat and more fruits and vegetables, the weight has slowly come off.  I have my thyroid checked every 6 months with good results so far.  Between the medication and some dietary changes, my cholesterol is down from 230 to 206.  I still have about 6 pounds to get back to my starting weight.  Unless there's a permanent cure out there, I won't mind taking this little lifesaver forever.
3894	dispermox	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sinus infection	The benefits of amoxicillin were that it did help clear the infection, it seemed to help my acne, also.  I noticed it working within about four days.  I only had to take it for a week.  It did not taste bad.  It did not make me foggy headed.	the amoxicillin gave me some gastrointestinal upset.  After a few days, I had mild diarrhea.  It caused a vaginal yeast infection.  After the regimen was over, I felt more tired that usual.  I think the natural flora in my body was altered and somehow made me feel more tired.  I have taken this medication several times for different infections.  I was concerned about resistance.	The amoxicillin was given in 500mg pill form 3 times daily for one week. It was inconvenient to have to take the medicine every 8 hours, but the physician recommended this time frame in order to keep the blood levels at a helpful level.  It meant having to wake up in the middle of the night to take it.
2154	zyrtec	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	Over the course of about three to four months of daily use, lifelong allergies started to decrease and then disappear altogether.	None for me, some of the possible side effects are dry nasal passages, nose bleeds, and it could keep you awake if you take it too close to bedtime, but I have not experienced any of those except for 2 or 3 nose bleeds over the course of six or seven years.	1 Tablet once per day, each day.

I would need at least 7-8 hours of sleep to not get groggy.	1/2 of a 10 mg pill as needed. Purposely would take it sparingly due to any addictive issues. Some doctors believe it is truly addictive; others not so. But I believe in as few drugs as possible in my life. I am also very afraid of any type of addiction. Therefore, I opt to split the pill in half and only take it 2-3 times a week.
433	imitrex	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine	my migraines would always leave after taking imitrex or sumatriptan and then if taken at night i could go back to sleep and sleep through the night and wake feeling just fine.	I found that my blood veins would stick out all down my arms and hands during the next days after the treatment and that these veins would be very painful.  there was an ache throughout my arms and sometimes in my legs due to this sumatriptan.	the optimum time for the shot is at bedtime and this is when I would take the shot and immediately lie down. my heart would race just after taking the shot and i would feel pain shooting through my body. but i have always found that the headace left EXCEPT if i had the shots too close together in that this seemed to stir up the headache for some reason.
1113	effexor	3	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	This drug did have benefits in that it stabilized my mood somewhat. I still suffer from severe bouts of depression- mostly caused by the side effects of the drug.	the side effects are sever for me and include:  rapid weight gain which is next to impossible to loose. Very high cholesterol which requires more medication (20mg lipitor per day)Debilitation sexual side effects: impotence and inability to reach orgasm.  Profuse sweating, indigestion, lethargy.  I am now severely addicted to this medication with no way to get off it. Any attempt to stop taking the medication leads to severe physical and emotional pain.	I agree that this medication has some positive effects but the negative side-effect FAR OUTWEIGH the good.  Its been prescribed over and over to me by lazy doctors not willing to help me find the right medication for my condition. Any attempt to discontinue the medication has led to severe and acute withdrawal symptoms.

274	deltasone	6	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	crohn's disease	Remission of Crohn's Disease.  Remission included normal bowel movenments from about 15/day to 1 or 2 per day. Cramps associated with diarrhea have disappeared. Increased energy, feeling active and generally feeling better.  Endoscopy was done at one point after the treatment and there was indication of only very mild disease so basically remission was achieved according to my gastroenterologist.	"Edema, weight gain, round face occurring about 3 weeks into the treatment. Insomnia, headache and hperactivity occurred at 50 mg daily, and subsided when dose decreased to 40 mg daily.
I was first diagnosed with Crohn's in 1980 and at that time not too much was known about effective treatments and so on.  My gastroenterologist at the time prescribed 5mg of prednisone daily for an indefinite period of time. This did not help at all, in fact I became sicker and sicker, lost a lot of weight and had frequent diarrhea and severe cramps all day. I became osteopenic and had a bowel perforation 2 years later.  The perforation was believed to be due to the long term prenisone I was taking.  I had a bowel resection done.  A new Gastroenterologist started me on a new treatment schedule."	"The new treatment schedule started with 50 qam for 1 week.  Decrease to 40 mg for a week, and then slowly keep decreasing by 5 mg daily, for a week at a time, until finished. Usually takes about a month. I only needed to take prednisone about once a year when flare-ups occurred. 
Remission periods between flareups became further and further apart as I became older, often years, so I am no longer osteopenic as a result."

3747	lamictal	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	epilepsy	Lamictal stopped my seizures as well as Epilim, but it gave me a considerate amount of energy.  Some would see it as a benefit to not have an appetite, even though it's bad for your health to not eat.  My depression went away with Lamictal.  Even when I had an appetite I still wouldn't eat much, which helped me greatly, since Epilim gave me terrible cravings.	"I experienced hair loss at times.  I wouldn't have an appetite and throw up if I had something to eat. I get terrible mood swings.  In the beginning I would suffer from sleeplessness.  My body would be tired, but my brain wouldn't stop working.  Don't know how to explain it.  I've had a little rash, but nothing serious.  I've been an athlete my whole life, so training and staying in shape is a big thing for me, but since I've been on Lamictal I've gained a considerate amount of weight and not being able to lose it.  I've carried on training, but my weight just stands still, after all my weight gain.  I've managed to lose 5kg's in 3 years and that was an amazing achievement for me.  My weight has made me terribly depressed, since my body isn't accustomed to it.

I went back to my Neurologist, but after driving 400km's and paying R800, he told me that I'm talking nonsense, because Lamictal has never been said to make a patient pick up weight.  There's a first time for everything you know. 

I just don't know what to do, because I just can't carry on like this.  It has affected my cycling, my running, my swimming, but he clearly doesn't give a damn."	I was on Epilim for a few months, but went over to Epitec (Lamictal) because Epilim made me very tired and depressed.  Apparently Epitec was the tablet with the least side-effects.
3503	maxalt	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraines	This is the best migraine medication on the market. Imitrex no longer works for me. I cannot be without maxalt or I will be in the ER. When I took Imitrex, I would have to repeat the dosage every 8-10 hours for 3 days. But, with Maxalt, I take one dose and it lasts for the whole migraine and I never have to take another dose until the next migraine.	no side effects	"LOVE THIS MEDICATION

Hair loss is still ongoing, miniturization of hair follicles is still ongoing.	Period like cramps which increase in severity with increase in dosage. Medication would be more effective if the dosage were increased but I cannot tolerate the cramping which even two extra strength Advil cannot alleviate.	Dermatologist prescribed Spironolactone for female Androgenetic hair loss. 100 mg per day. It has been somewhat effective in slowing down hair loss but has not completely stopped the excess shedding.
3640	retin-a	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne and wrinkles	My skin is now smoother with less acne.  I still get a pimple here and there, but for the most part, my skin has been very clear.	My skin had slight burning the next day as well as a lot of flaking and dryness.  It is very difficult to control the dryness.  I put a lot of moisturizer on it in the morning, but need to reapply it throughout the day.	After wasing your face at night and letting it completely dry, you apply a thin layer all over your face and go to bed.  In the morning you need to wash your face and apply a lot of moisturizer.  Stick with it, it will provide resluts after about 6 weeks.
4136	chantix	5	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	smoking cessation	Was supposed to wait 10 days before attempting to quit 100%. The urge to smoke lessened significantly from first day.  Went from smoking 15-20 cigarettes a day to about 5-10 the first day.  By the end of the first week a was smoking 1 or 2 a day.  Quit before the 10 days were up.  1.5 years later, I am still not smoking.	Very irritable and angry.  Fell into a depression.	"Within the first week I was very irritable but that is to be expected. I've quit for a couple of months before and this happened, too.  However, I completely changed.  I could not control my temper, I got very depressed. I didnt realize what was happening other than I just felt ""bitchy"".  After 3 weeks  I quit using the drug from 2/day to 1/day for a few days then quit.  Total I used it for about a month.  

I went into a severe depression in which I was either very angry, very sad or just felt numb. I cycled between those feelings. Nothing brought me pleasure, the things that used to love to do like dancing or  going out with friends, did nothing for me.  I didn't care to do them. I thought I was going crazy. I was like this for about 4 months before I started feeling a little better and maybe about 6-7 months before I felt like myself again.  

I still get occasional cravings but the thought of going through that again keeps me away.  I consider it to be effective but would recommend joining a support group or going to a counselor to help cope with the mood swings.  If you don't have someone you see on a daily basis that can point out those changes I would highly recommend the latter.  I didn't realize that i had fallen into a depression until months into it."
3430	tazorac	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	fine lines/wrinkles	I noticed firmer, more toned skin and a decrease in the appearance of fine lines on my face, especially around the eye area.	For the first few weeks, I experienced dry and flaking skin. This later turned into a burning sensation, which decreased over time.	I was prescribed Tazorac after requesting a Retinol treatment from my doctor. I initially asked for Retin-A, but she suggested Tazorac as it was better suited for my skin type.

But after two years of taking it, it did not seem working.	I start the dose very small and gradually increased.  I did not have any side effects.	I used to take lithium for my bipolar disorder and it worked great.  Because of my age, and an episode of lithium toxicity, my doctor suggest I stop using lithium, instead, try Lamectal.   I took Lamactal for two years now, I had three episodes of depression which was quite bad.  I think Lamactal is not working.  My doctor suggest to change to Depokote and give it a try.

511	tenormin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	tachycardia	"The benefits were immediate relief from a ""racing heart"" or tachycardia caused by anxiety. I use this medicine prophylactically and found that it is very effective in controlling my heart rate and keeping it within a normal range. The only time it does not work is if I have a full-blown panic attack. At that point, other types of medications are used in addition to the atenolol."	The side effects were mild but it did slightly lower my ability to determine if I was having an insulin reaction (hypoglycemia). However, once I adjusted to the medication, it was not a problem.	Treatment was started immediately after an initial and severe case of tachycardia. An Echocardiogram ruled out any heart defect and I was started on 25 mg once per day. I stayed on this dose for about 6 years and was able to drop down to 12.5 mg per day for nearly a year. However, my symptoms returned to their original severity and I began taking my starting dose again. A few years later, I was prescribed 25 mg twice per day due to an increase from original symptoms. This is the dose I currently take and it is an effective and very affordable medication.

You do not gain weight! I have taken most of the usual bi polar meds and felt like a fat zombie. 80mg of cialopram really works.	Started at 20mg and slowly went up. I did trial many anti psychotics with it. Although the other meds worked the side effects were revolting. So I have just stuck with citalopram 80mg. There is a huge huge difference from 40mg to 80mg. I became a lot less manic at 80mg infact i am basically never manic at 80mg. Really this dose levels me out and i recommend it for anyone who suffers rapid cycling bi polar. I have been on 80mg for over 18 months and the change is amazing!
1059	oracea	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	The treatment cleared up papules and pustules (not completely, but significantly) and decreased redness in the face.	Yeast infections, stomach upset, fatigue. Strangely enough, it was only after coming off of antibiotics that I developed deep cystic acne. Before I had many small papules/pustules, but they were never very deep. After the antibiotics, the number I would have on my face at one time decreased, but I developed cysts deep under the surface of the skin that would sit there for weeks (never happened before).	Eventually stopped taking Oracea because of the yeast infections. The long-term use of this and other antibiotics seems to have affected my immune system negatively.

I was given this to prevent pregnancy and i am going off because i'd rather have a child and an orgasm than no child and no orgasm
3203	omnicef	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	sinus infection	This drug was prescribed because my daughter has had adverse side effects from penicillin based antibiotics (trunk rash/hives from amoxicillin for an ear infection). She had a sinus infection that we couldn't get rid of with natural remedies (salt water flush, tea, elevated sleeping) so we went the antibiotic route.	"Her side effects were almost immediate thoug it took my husband and I 3 doses (3 days) to figure it out.  For an almost three year old, her moods were fairly predictable.  She was irritable when she was hungry, tired, or needed to poop.  But about 24 hours after her first dose of Cefdinir! Her moods drastically changed to violent, out-of-control, scary, temper tantrums.  To the point where she was biting herself, Banging her head on the wall and hitting and kicking us with all her might.  And when we would try and stop her, it was like she didn't recognize us and would get scared and cry. 

It was disturbing and very upsetting for us a parents. We started doing research the next day and little info on the drug except for druglib.com and the official side effect page. We found drastic mood changes buried in the side effects information and discontinued use.

Our doctor didn't seem that concerned even after we explained the scary details. He prescribed aZ Pack for her symptoms and she has been fine ever since (we have a new doctor now though)."	Our daughter completed her treatment with a z pack.
2867	aldactone	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	The Spironolactone has really helped my acne, especially the huge flare ups I'd have monthly with my period.  I do still occasionally have break outs, but they are usually less severe, shorter lasting, and confined to my face.	The main side effect I've had is irregular periods.  First it was annoying, not knowing when my period when come.  Then as my period became less frequent, it was actually kind of nice.  However, now I feel like about 15 or 20 days into my cycle I start to bloat like normal, but don;t start or get relief for about another thirty or so days.  So, now I kinda feel like it's bloating or acne to choose from.	I take two 50 mg spironolactone tablets each morning along with 50 mg od doxycycline.
510	amerge	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	Amerge is effective in reducing the pain and associated symptoms of migraines.	Mild drowsiness, sometimes mild nausea.	I have very severe migraine disease and have tried many different treatments.  None are effective 100% of the time.  In my experience, Amerge is the most effective for mild and moderate migraines (Nothing seems to work for severe attacks). I prefer Amerge because the beneficial effects seem to last longer than many of the other anti-migraine meds (often 18-24 hrs.). Also, side effects seem to be negligible(No palpitations and dizziness like with imitrex). The downside is that Amerge takes longer to work (2-4 hrs) than the other triptans. But because of the better safety profile and the longer duration of effectiveness, for me Amerge is a top choice for migraines.

THATS ALL...	after two shots of cortisone to my knee, I had an mri done...this showed no problems yet the cortisone injections lasted only about four months.  My dr did not want to give additional injections and prescribed physical therapy, which I did, but it only aleviated the pain for a short time and never for an entire day.  My job requires me to be on my feet and I needed more relief.  I went to an internist (the first doctor was a bone and joint specialist) who prescribed spiralactone.  OK, I didnt have much faith in a water pill, but it worked and still continues to work.  I do not take many medications but I do make sure I never run out of this miracle.
1919	climara-pro	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hot flashes	There was a small reduction in my hot flashes but the side effect was bothering me too much to stay on the patch longer to see if it would have totally eliminated them over time.	I developed gas pains in my abdomen where the patch was. I was very bloated and uncomfortable.  I think I gained a couple of pounds too and I had only been using it for a week.	The doctor thought I should try the patch because it would bypass my liver. I have been taking pills for eight years and didn't really have any side effects - so I returned to my original treatment of estradiol and provera.
168	zomig	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine	I have terrible headaches that nothing ever helped, until zomig.  it has been a miracle drug for me.	Makes my skin feel a little tingly and makes me tired.	Take it as soon as i feel headache coming on and within 1 or 2 hours i am usually pain free.
3436	tazorac	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anti aging	my skin appeared smoother after an initial rough period with the start up of the product...fine lines seem to diminish and overall my skin seemed less sallow and more even toned....although, because of the continuing side effects it's difficult to stick with a consistent application	very dry skin that would begin to peel and flake especially during the application of makeup...irritation producing some red spots near the sides of nostril and lips that prevented continued use of product for weeks...twice the application on the upper chest area produced a rash ... the sensivity to sun exposure increased even with strong sun screens thus inhibiting outside activity	At first I applied a dime sized amount to my face every other day. I would wash my face and wait 10 minutes so the skin was completely dry for application. I applied the cream to the cheek area and spread outward trying to avoid the sensitive corners of the mouth, nose & eyes. I decreased the amount when I began to get some peeling and then took a break from treatment when I got obvious irritation. At this point, the treatment has to be on and off a schedule to avoid the side effects.
1410	adipex-p	4	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	loose weight	Well, I did not have an appetite all day.  But then at night, I was very hungry.  I only lost about 2 pounds in the week I took it.	The side effects were bad.  I had a racing heart beat, difficulty concentraing and I could not sleep.  And the worst was the headache!  I wish I had taken my blood pressure.  I think it was probably very high.	There are not treatment details really.  I was overwieghtand not loosing even though I was followinga strict diet and eating well.  I needed to up my metabolism.  It worked.  But aftera week of no sleep and bad headaches, I decided it wasn't worth it.
4113	chantix	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	20 year pack a day smoker	Definately helps control the urge to smoke.  Was able to make it through the first week of no smoking with VERY CONTROLABLE urges.	Disrupted sleep is the only side effect so far.  However, I'm military and deployed, so sleeping well in these conditions is a luxury anyway.  Vivid dreams...I'm remembering my dreams, which is not normal for me.  Occasional nightmare, and frequent waking.	2 pills a day as prescribed.  I recommend it, but results obviously vary.  A few friends have also used it with identical results.  None of us take *any* other medication, which may be a substantial variable.  So far no suicidal thoughts or rages.
1401	adipex-p	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	weight loss	lost weight very fast then mantained it for 4 years.	dry mouth, restless,no appitite	I was given this drug to help lose weight, it worked perfect other than it was very costly and very few doctors prescibe it.
2270	lexapro	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Lessened anxiety,brought about more attention	drowsiness,lethargy,lack of deep emotions	take one pill daily
2190	clonazepam	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	nerve damage, 1 nerve near mouth during surgery	It reduced the tingling sensation, and numbness feeling in the effected part,it also acted on reducing stress levels. I found it as a last resort because for 3 years before that my life was very painful cause of the nerve damage, that I suffered during a Mucocele removal. I took the anti anxiety drug for 2 years and its side effect that it blocks nerve communication helped a lot, and thx god after 5 years i am cured, my nerve healed.	It was hard to discontinue, I had to quater the tablets, and take 3/4, for 2 weeks, then 1/2 for 2 weeks  then 1/4 for a week before i could get out of it.	It reduced the tingling sensation, and numbness feeling in the effected part, I found it as a last resort because for 3 years before that my life was very painful cause of the nerve damage, that I suffered during a Mucocele removal. I took the anti anxiety drug for 2 years and its side effect that it blocks nerve communication helped a lot, and thx god after 5 years i am cured, my nerve healed.
2250	zovirax	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	herpes zoster	I have had Herpes Zoster or VZV all my life. Acyclovir completely eliminates the headache and flu like symptoms. If I take it early enough it stops all outbreaks in one or two days. If taken late; I need a higher dose and it can eliminate blisters in 2 or three days. My outbreaks were once or twice a year and I only used acyclovir cream. Now it appears less than once a year and can be stopped with Zovirax(Acyclovir).	I get sleepy and buzzy headed. No other side effects from the medicine.	"I take three 400mg tablets in 24 hours for the first two days. This equals 1200mg in 24 hours. Then 800mg for two days. I can take it with just coffee in the morning. I drink extra water. I also use zovirax cream. 
I don't have any medical insurance and I buy all my medicine at In House pharmacy online."
136	valtrex	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	genital herpes	Shortened duration of herpes outbreak.	No side effects were noticed. The outbreak itself usually can have body aches and fever.	At the first sign of a possible outbreak I would beging taking the medication. It would be taken twice daily for three days. Discussed possible daily dosage if outbreaks became more frequent. I decided to try a more natural approach with Lysine taken at any signs with very similar results.
1480	cymbalta	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	anxiety/depression	Slight anxiety reduction but minimal.	Insomnia!  Dry mouth, at 60 mg. urinary retention (potentially very serious!), confusion, blurred reading vision, tight chest, anxiety attack (fast heart rate and fast, shallow breathing), lethargy.	Started 15 then to 30 then 45 then 60.  At 60 unfunctional and urinary retention!  Back to 30 then 45.  Doesn't seem to work for me after one month.
3169	prednisone	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	allergic reaction on face to a cosmetic	"Facial swelling reduced dramatically over 3 days, only to return (less so) as a side effect.  I could have just taken Benadryl, and although it would have taken longer to recover from the allergic reaction (possibly another week), I would have been normal without side effects, and without withdrawal effects.  The drug took a modest problem and created a far worse one.  I told the physician I reacted strongly to drugs.  Since then I've learned that some physicians are quite blas� about the side effects of prednisone -- apparently that old adage about ""first do no wrong"" is no longer important."	"constant :    pulse pounding throughout body, flushed face, odd-looking eyes (dilated), high blood pressure ( systolic range 145-194; ), fatigue, severe insomnia, nervousness, inability to concentrate, mild vertigo (spill, drop, lurch, and fall).
Withdrawal symptoms (fatigue, tinnitus, leg aches) continue after 4 weeks, though improving gradually.
increasing over time :   panic attacks, anxiety"	Oral, 10 mg. tablets, 3 days at 60mg, gradual tapering over 18 days
1285	provigil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	narcolepsy, sleep apnea, bipolar disorder	I am able to stay awake while driving.  I am able to focus on tasks and concentrate better.  My concentration is clearer.  It's not habit-forming because I could live without it.  It's just that I can not function without it.  I can't drive, or stay awake for any reasonable length of time during the day.  My narcolepsy and sleep apnea are so bad that I do not dream at night at all.  With the provigil, along with my other medications, I am able to balance day and night and not feel like I'm fighting to keep my eyelids open.  Also, I don't need any caffeine or other stay awake medications that are harmful and habit-forming.	During the first week, my heart rate increased as I increased the dose, but now my heart rate is perfectly normal.  I believe it may have given me a little headache/stomach ache the first week as well, but those are gone now too.	I take my provigil every morning, 3 200mg tablets.  I am awake for about the first 4 hours, then I nap for a little while.  I am up for about 2 hours, and nap again.  Then, I'm up for the evening, go to bed at a decent time and wake up at a regular hour feeling rested now.
1984	fiorinal	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine headaches	relieved headache 99% of time, headaches did not recur for at least 18 hours	occasional heartburn - treated with Pepcid Complete	at earliest onset of migraine symptoms - throbbing pain in temple, sensitivity to noise or light, extreme irritiability- pain behind or around eye area - I would take one tablet with tea or water. Usually would subside within 10 - 20 minutes.
898	paxil	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	no more anxiety	weight gain, sleepiness	At first I was not given the proper dosage and it took about six months to get the right dose. One my body became accustomed to that dosage it was purely smooth sailing from there. The 20mg paxil dose completely stopped my symptoms. I have been on this drug free of problems for over 7 yrs
197	adderall	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	adhd	This treatment was easy and highly effective. Adderall increased my overall energy levels, making it easier to get going in the morning and stay awake during classes. It increased my ability to pay attention even when the material was not particularly interesting to me. The most important benefit for me was the increased ability to control my impulses.	If taken too late in the day, it can interfere with sleep. It must be carefully controlled as it is addictive. The main side effect I have experienced though was pathological skin picking. I mainly pick at my legs, but the picking sometimes leaves small scars. It also decreases appetite, which means patients must learn new ways to remember to eat or to identify the need to eat. It can also increase blood pressure slightly.	Adderall was taken once in the morning every day. This medication was combined with cognitive behavioral therapy once a week. Within the last year, neurofeedback (biofeedback to control brainwave patterns) was added. This treatment has been very effective, and will be continued as long as it is needed.
2351	propecia	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hair less	It greatly reduced the loss of hair in shower/on pillow in the morning.  There has been no sign of balding on top of head, and no progression on the temples.	There were no noticeable side effects.	I take it once a day in the morning and will continue taking it indefinitely.
1494	metrogel	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	rosacea	I saw absolute no change in my rosacea so can claim no benefits.	I had no treatment side effects.	I have rosacea on one side of my face and my physician prescribed Metrogel in 0.75%.  I rubbed the cream on the rosacea twice a day after washing my face.  After six months I saw neither improvement nor complications/side effects.
1803	oxycontin	2	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	pain after surgery	The drug was prescribed for pain, and it worked to dull post op pain.	The drug made me terribly constipated, which in my opinion, negated the value of the drug. The strain to eliminate was very painful considering the recent surgery.	After 1 day of oxycontin and the ensuing constipation, I switched to 800 mg of ibuprofen. While not as effective for the pain, the constipation was alleviated. Overall, the ibuprofen was better for me.
2096	renova	8	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	hyperpigmentation	Tretinoin, used in conjunction with the Obagi regimen, greatly reduced facial hyperpigmention which was due to hormones and sun damage.	Severe redness, burning and peeling occurred in the first 6-8 months of use, but gradually dissipated.	"Tretinoin (pea size) was blended on the back of the hand with an equal amount of Blender (#5 step in the Obagi system).  The mixture was then applied to the face, neck and chest avoiding the eyes and lips. The residual cream remaining on the hand was spread on the back of the hands to reduce ""age spots"".  No noticeable side effects were evident on the hands, but the procedure was effective.  Care was taken not to expose the treated areas to sunlight."
771	naproxen	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	arthritis	reduced the pain and swelling	caused severe abdominal cramps and bouts of diarrhoea and constipation	given over a period of 3 years... at first daily and then, due to stomache irritation, reduced to use only when needed. Stomache problems evident when taking 3 a day for 2 or more days.  Given tab for coating the stomache.
2293	lexapro	1	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	anxiety, stress	Eliminated or reduced symptoms of anxiety - eliminated heart palpitations and shortness of breath. Provided a general feeling of calm.	"The worst, and the reason for d/c'ing, side effect was hot flashes and night sweats that awakened me and interfered with my working.
Secondly, I felt drowsy during the day even on this low (5 mg day) dose. I tried taking at night and the trialed taking it in the AM and experienced no difference in the side effects. 
Both side effects are completely gone now that I have stopped taking it."	I believe I have already done so.
2708	divigel	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	menopause	The treatment completely eliminated all annoying menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and anxiety.  I no longer wake up at night with these symptoms and can sleep soundly through the night once again.	There were no negative side effects whatsoever.	Convenient topical gel is applied once daily.  The only con is that it took 3 weeks before it was fully effective.
2093	selegiline	3	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	head injury	There were no noticable changes with selegiline, it was prescribed to help focus and attention for TBI.	Raised blood pressure, during the initial stages when increasing doseage became quite shaky at times and it appeared to be harded to start to walk, muscles seemed to be hesitant. These disappeared when stopped taking.	take two and half tablets in the morning for two weekds then three tablets for two weeks then increas to 3.5 each morning (5mg)tabs
1118	effexor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	The numbness in my arms and hands significantly reduced. I was having uncontrollable emotions of sadness, crying and even thoughts of suicide.  Taking the effexor helped me not only control my emotions but also diminished the intensity as well.	Initally when I started taking Effoxor it upset my stomach. I was taking in the morning after breakfast so the Dr. suggested taking it before bedtime which solved that problem.  I have been taking it for sometime now and do not remember any other side effects from this mediation.	I started off taking 50mg for two weeks then increased the dosage to 75mg for two weeks.  After visiting the Dr. after a month on this dosage he recommended going up to 100mg and eventually I increased it to 150mg.  This is currently the dosage I am taking.
4063	amoxil	2	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	tooth infection	The amoxicillin got rid of my tooth infection very quick	"I was noticing that I was getting
Light headed and had very painful pains
In my tummy at first I put it down to, too many ibuprofen , so i stop taking them but evey time after I took the amoxicillin table i started to feel light head and the pain in my tummy were so survear that I was doubled over in pain"	They prescribed to me for my tooth infection , side effects set in after about 3 days if taking them
2866	aldactone	3	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	hormonal acne	Not much improvement in hormonal acne.	Dry mouth and lips	I started taking Spironolactone for hormonal acne about two months ago along with tazorac and a sulfur face wash. My acne remains the same with only a small change. I still have cysts but but not as many (reduced by 30%).
3133	duragesic	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	severe chronic pain	Extremely effective in reducing long-term, chronic pain (muskoskeltal and nerve), especially as a long-acting, baseline pain reducer in combination with a break-thru medication (I used Hydrocodone APAP and/or Percocet) for spikes in pain levels (due to falls, joint dislocations, broken bones, etc that cause temporary or short-term increases in pain.)	It is a very strong opioid, which is highly sedating, especially in combination with other drugs that can cause drowsiness. Even though I am very opioid-tolerant, it was still sedating for me.  In addition to causing drowsiness and fatigue, it tends to be highly habit-forming.  Because of the strength and nature of the drug, the human body becomes physically dependent on it, which has a few implications.  First, it loses efficacy over time, meaning you need to keep increasing the dosage over time to maintain the same effectiveness. The other issue with physical dependence is withdrawal.  I had severe physical withdrawal symptoms if I waited too long to change the patch (starting a day or so after I was scheduled to change it and becoming more and more severe with time.)  Several specialists I saw actually recommended hospitalization for controlled dose reduction as the safest way to stop taking fentanyl patches because they cause such severe physical withdrawal symptoms.  I withdrew from it completely 3 times, and suffered severe, debilitating symptoms for the first couple of weeks each time with decreasingly severe symptoms lasting for over a month after I stopped using it.  Although I have never had an issue with psychological dependence on any drug, I think it is important to mention that this one can be very addictive (meaning that those who take it frequently develop a psychological dependence, especially if the user is prone to substance abuse.)	I took Duragesic as a long-term maintenance medication on several different occasions, but it can be taken permanently as long as it remains effective.
869	paxil	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	panic disorder	The main benefit is the ability of the drug to reduce, even eliminate the panic attacks. The general mood is positively improved.	Many listes un the literature, but in my case the worst are intermenstrual bleeding, back pain, laziness, abscense of sexual desire.	I just take one 20 mg pill at night. Medical check-up once a year including lab tests.
2402	synthroid	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypthyroidism	Treatment benefits included a correction of my T3, but only a mild improvement in my emotional status. I am still irritable and mildly depressed.	Weight gain of 20# in 4 months, continuation of my irritability and mild depression.	Treatment involved radiation treatment to shrink my thyroid to correct my hyperthyroidism, followed by Rx with Synthroid to treat the hypothyroidism.
1091	effexor	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	The benefits of taking Effexor are wonderful. My mood has been so much better. I can function properly without feeling overwhelmed and or stressed out. I have recommended this drug to many of my friends who have had similar problems.	The side effects are mild, but excessive sweating is one of them. I seem to sweat a good bit more than I normally did as well as sweat more than other people that I notice. Also night sweats have been a problem from time to time. Constipation can also be a side effect.	The details in the treatment are just as I described shortly above. I went to the doctor, they prescribed it and I take it. Don't really know what else to say here for the treatment details.
1457	cymbalta	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	fibromyalgia and depression	none	I had little motivation, I felt like I was in a daze, my memory was worse	I have recurrent major depression. This medication was prescribed to deal with a severe episode. When I stopped taking the medication after at least a year, my memory rapidly improved and I felt more alive.  I had a very bad experience with this drug.
199	adderall	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	adhd, depression/anxiety	Adderall helps to clear my mind. It helps me finish work that I have already begun. It also reduces anxiety in social situations.	"Muscle tension, laziness, daytime sleepiness, avoidant behavior. Lack of creativity - seems like I'm ""stuck"" in a routine. General irritability."	Started with Celexa to treat anxiety/depression, then was diagnosed with adult ADHD, and started on Adderall. Abused Adderall for about a year (sometimes taking up to 120mg per day), but eventually returned to 30 mg.
429	imitrex	2	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	migraine headaches	The drug did absolutely nothing for the pain or to lessen the time of the migraine.  The migraines were usually sseveral days long.	I experienced slightly more gagging while dry heaving and nausea changed to sickening feeling and more stomach churning.	Took Imitrex for a 3 month period and still had no noticeable results.  The tablet was suppose to lessen the pressure and pain if taken at onset of migraine.  I ended up trying Aleve and still take it to this day for migraines.
3628	retin-a	4	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	sun damage	The benefits were a very gradual reduction in the appearance of sun spots on the skin. The spots themselves never disappeared but lightened over a period of time. The general appearance of the skin also improved slightly but it did not prevent new spots from appearing as I noticed that they did, although I suspect that the cream probably kept them lighter than they would have been. Discontinuation did make the darkness come back into the sun spots after about 4 to 6 months however.	There were really no side effects; perhaps the tiniest of tingling at the ery first couple of applications then none after.	"Topical application of the cream daily, usually at night. The recommended amount was ""pea sized"" but I found it too thick to get this amount to massage into the whole face."
3483	diazepam	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sleep	Most often the diazepam got me to sleep fairly quickly but did not last the whole night through.  The liquid capsules were then superceded by tablets which usually took about twice as long to kick in.  ie, 40 mins instead of 20. The benefit was there if I was unable to sleep otherwise but a benzo sleep is not natural and feels different to real sleep.	Twitching nerves for several days afterward.  Difficulty sleeping.	Taking a pill to get to sleep.

Clear skin
Light periods"	"Vaginal dryness

Painful intercourse

Decrease in skin lustre and elasticity"	Lost interest in sex rapidly, if I was ever aroused (very rare) I couldn't achieve an orgasm, every part of my body seemed to dry out and subsequently age a bit and in the case of my eyes this drying and ageing process was pretty severe. Doctors were baffled as to why I'd ended up with such dry eyes at such a young age, said they weren't sure what caused it but said it normally happens to menopausal or elderly women (I was 20-21 at the time). Now looking back I realise that the dry eyes match with a lot of the other symptoms I was experiencing at the time, many of which are normally symptoms of the menopause/ageing. Considering these symptoms have now either completely disappeared or improved since stopping the use of hormonal birth control methods (I now use the copper IUD), I believe they may well have been linked Yasmin. Yasmin is one scary pill- I came off it worried that I was prematurely going through the menopause and that I would never be able to enjoy painless, bloodless, pleasurable sex again.
1806	oxycontin	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	severe and chronic back pain	Truly allows me to function.  I work in a mentally demanding and stressful job.  Without this medication, I would not be able to work, let alone do much of anything else.	"Yes, there are side effects.  Constipation is an issue that requires trying different means to address.  Tradition treatments didn't help, but odd ones that I stumbled on have - like eating raw brazil nuts; now it's home-made chex mix.  NutriSystems food (with high fiber and fillers) really works.

There is a mild, physical addiction property.  Over the ten years that I have used this medication, I have slowly reduced by dosage from 50 mg down to 30 daily.  There was nauseousness and sweating, but I got through it.

When people say that prescription medicine isn't safe, I can only reply that my choices are either laying in bed because the pain is to great, or taking the medication and being able to function.  I am still limited in my physical activity, but I'm working and not constantly focused on the pain."	I take the Oxycontin three times a day - morning, lunch and dinner.  It is recommended to take on a full stomach, though I've never noticed an issue when I haven't.  If I take my regular dose one to two hours after it's due, my back pain is very severe, so I know it's working.
2940	tofranil-pm	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	panic attacks	After 2-3 weeks complete abatement of panic attack symptoms.  After one year tried to stop taking them but within 3 weeks symptoms were back.  continued for two more years and stopped taking them.  Have not had any symptoms for @10 years now	hyperactivity for up to 8 hrs after taking.	started at 5 mg then increased every 5-7 days up to 25 mg.  Hyperactivity decreased with longer treatment
1981	fiorinal	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	Fiorinal almost always gets rid of my migraine headaches.	Occasional drowsiness, though this is preferred as I usually need to lie down in a dark place when I have a migraine.	I'd typically take one Fiorinal capsule at the onset of a migraine headache, with water and sometimes salted crackers. (If I didn't catch it at the onset, the capsule generally had no effect).  I would then lie down in a quiet, dark room.  The pill would typically reduce the headache within 30-45 minutes.  Occasionally I would end up feeling sluggish afterwards - not sure if this was a result of the medication or the headache.  Regardless, it has worked well to reduce headache pain.
734	claripel-cream	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	melasma	Lightening of dark spots that I experienced on both of my cheeks from melasma. I noticed definite results within weeks; however, with only short periods of accidental sun exposure the dark spots would reappear. Make sure to use sunscreen and hats or avoid sun exposure completely to enjoy continued results.	None	I washed my face twice a day with gentle cleanser and applied the hydroquinone 4% twice daily. I also used a Retin A cream once a day that caused some irritation and redness, but when used alone, I didn't have this effect from the hydroquinone alone.
2983	strattera	4	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	add	The 1st week  felt great.  All the racing thoughts were gone.  Mind was kinda empty and quiet.  I could concentrate.  I was able to think of a task that needed done and complete it.  Then move on to the next task.  Was only able to work on 1 thing at a time instead of going from one thing to the next without finishing anything. Could listen to the person talking to me without starting to day dream and lose the conversation. Was very happy with it.	1st 2 days had nothing in my head.  No thoughts at all.  Didn't talk because there was nothing to say.  I could understand people talking to me, but didn't have responses.  Kinda groggy. Took a nap on the 1st day, which is something I never do.  In my third week, feel like its stopped working.  Minds not racing like before, but feels like all my thoughts are blurry. Feel very blah, not motivated at all. Could sit all day and do nothing.  Before meds I ran around all day from one thing to the next and not finish anything.  I could be in the middle of folding laundry, then walk away to do the dishes.  I couldn't take my kids with me to the grocery store because their talking would distract me and I would forget things.  Taking a list wouldn't help because I couldn't write lists.  Now, I don't even want to do the laundry.  I don't want to do anything.  I wondering if changing the dose will help.	Started out on 40ml.  Which I thought was kinda high because I only weigh 118.  Was told to go to 80ml after only 3 days.  I did that and could not sleep at all!  Was awake for at least 48 hours.  So the doc had me go back down to 40ml.  Which isn't working now.
297	vesicare	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	urge incontinence and bladder spasm	Bladder spasms and urge incontinence were banished immediately. Urinary frequency continued but is becoming less as I am able to retrain my bladder to hold more urine. I was particularly pleased not to suffer from constipation or dry mouth which are listed as common side effects.	None	Vesicare 5mg tablet taken once daily in the morning.
2133	concerta	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	adhd	patient was able to focus more readily on tasks at hand. there was an increase in intensity/focus which was noticable upon taking the medication.	dry mouth	patient was to take one dose of concerta per day - earlier in the morning due to the time release effect. it was obvious while taking the medication that it was time release as each layer was released.
3482	diazepam	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	sleeping disorder	go to http://medsheaven.com/ and i sa diazepam online, and it works! friends reccomend it because of having a sleeping disorder, i try it once in a while, there is now side effects and it works all good helps me for my sleeping disorder no side effects	no side effects	helps me for my sleeping disorder
811	ambien	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	restlessness	allowed me to sleep soundly without feeling groggy in the morning.	I didn't have any side effects if I was allowed enough sleep.  If I did not receive enough sleep it would be very hard to wake up and I would feel as if I had not slept at all making it very hard to stay alert.  I would say at least 6-7 hours of sleep is needed.	Take one daily at bedtime for rest due to anxiety.  This prescription was issued for six months and I am currently still taking it.  It does not appear to be addictive as there are nights when I can sleep without it and do not crave it.
2609	adderall-xr	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	adult add	In a very short period of time, there was a mental clarity that I had never experienced. I felt a calm and order to my life and work. I was truly able to focus on important things that I needed to do and did so efficiently, which was something I was never able to do. Menopause exacerbated the extreme mental fuzziness that I had already been experiencing with 4 children and a more than full time job. This drug has truly changed my life for the better!	I did not experience any side effects that were negative. I could hear better and think in a focused way within a short amount of time (30-45 minutes after taking the drug)	I take a 30 mg. pill shortly after waking and within an hour, the fog that I chronically have had all of my life just lifts!
3668	effexor-xr	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	The xanax helped slow things down and make everything less stressful. helped me to stay on a calm even level.	unfortuntely it is extremely addictive and you can find yourself craving it, and everything can become a problem if I didnt have any.  Dealing with lifes regular ups and downs all became stressful if I didnt have it.  Had to stop taking it as soon as I noticed my behavior.	I want to say it was 50 mg. doses taken up to 3 times a day.  It was somewhat up to me when I needed to take it.  Mostly for anxiety attacks.
1576	xanax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	panic attacks	within 10 minutes the drug began to calm down the situation and I was able to function normally again. My racing heart rate was decreased, the feeling of panic subsided and the numbness in my arms and legs went away. I was able to eat again, and go about my daily routine.	The only real side effect was that depending on the severity of the attack and the amount I took, as sometimes I cut the pill in half, or if the case was extremely severe, I could take up to 1 mg. was that I got very sleepy. In a lower dose that was not the case but in the higher dosage it did occur.	The treatment details were to take only as needed and it could be taken up to 3X per day, but usually one pill did the trick. I didn't have a set protocol for taking the medication because the attacks were so random, they might not occur for months at a time, or they could happen two days in a row. So, I was told to take it only as needed. I still have a number of pills left from my RX of 30 last year.
3013	cipro	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	uti	I had a bad uti with awful pain on myside i couldnt walk..I was prescribed this and have never taken it so I was a little nervous.	The side affect I had was headache,diarriah after the 3rd day,and a I got my period (im not regular) really bad to where I had to goto hospital...I dont know if that was related to the medication.	It treated my uti I was better in a week but because of my heavy period I quit taking it after the 8th day..its been 4months and have not had any reoccurance of the uti
1179	prozac	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	Within a few days, my mood, self-esteem, attitude and over-all well-being improved tremendously! I went from feeling suicidal and not being able to funtion properly in order to take care of myself or my family, to feeling better than I had since I was in my teens. I began to lose some of the weight I had gained from being depressed. I was in a wonderful mood and I had so much more energy than I had in years. My overall experience with Prozac has been perfect!	I have had no known side effects to this date. I do watch out for muscle cramps that last more than a week and I have blood work done once a year to ensure that my kidneys are not being affected.	I started on 10 mgs. once a day and when that was tolerated well I went up to 40 mgs. This caused some insomnia and nervousness so my Dr. lowered it to 20 mgs. a day. There are still times I get depressed for a few days but that only happens once or twice a year and it is mild. I am looking at being on Prozac as long as my body toleates it, due to once being taken off I went into a fast downward spiral and had to begin again.
4010	celexa	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	There were no benefits.  It did not solve the organic issues and created new problems.	Firstly, this medication made me drowsy, and I often took involuntary naps mid-afternoon. Secondly, I had carbohydrate cravings, and felt hungry all the time. Lastly, after a couple of weeks I became weepy, irrational and anxious.  I can't imagine how magnified these symptoms would have been on a higher dose.	I began taking Celexa after Lexapro made me sleepy and hungry.  The Lexapro did indeed calm my anxieties.  It was thought that an isomer of Lexapro might be better tolerated.  This was not the case, and now I am off all medications for a short period to re-evaluate my baseline needs.
4017	celexa	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety and mild depression	Citalopram turned me into myself again. I didn't really have depression but suffered from too much worrying and anxiety to carry on healthy relationships and feel in control of my life. I have just begun feeling the full effects of this medication and it is incredible. I wake up early in the morning, rested and ready to go. I feel more motivated, have more energy and feel much more focused. I have also experienced some weight loss while on Citalopram, probably because I feel so motivated and energetic to actually exercise! Additionally I've noticed my worrying, anxiety and emotional eating have decreased significantly.	In the first few weeks I felt a little shaky and experienced dry mouth.	This was perscribed by my gynocologist and I plan to take it for the next year, then reasses my need.
825	zegerid	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	laryngopharyngeal reflux	fewer Reflux episodes, less inflammation of the Eustachian Tube, lower cancer risk	digestive problems: a few days per month	Laryngopharyngeal Reflux has caused a Eustachian Tube (ET) dysfunction.

Progress has already been achieved: inflammations of the ET have been reduced, the tissue surrounding the ET is regenerating.
2726	elavil	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	fibromyalgia	I was diagnosed with a mild case of fibromyalgia, I was not able to get a good night's sleep for years because of the symptons of fibromyalgia, muscle pain and tingling in my back and arms, and I was prescribed this drug to help me sleep at night.	No side effects were experienced by me, just a good night's sleep.	Before I started taking the pills I tossed and turned every night due to my symptoms and got very little rest, but the elavil helped me sleep thru the night and I woke up very rested and with very little pain. I took it for several years and stopped last year after I gradually cut back on my dosage, exercise and yoga have helped me manage my symptoms so I no longer needed help to sleep at night.
1248	sotret	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	the drug permanently cleared my acne.  i no longer had breakouts...not even blackheads.  my skin was very dry which i suppose for someone with oily skin this would have been a benefit.	"extreme dryness, redness, flaking, chapped lips, and occasional lower back pain.  i used aquaphor twice a day all over my face and lips.  this is the only way i could look ""normal"" because my face looked like it was literally peeling off."	i was prescribed 10mg of sotret once a day for 4 months in addition to being on orthotricylcen lo birth control pills as part of the pregnancy prevention program agreement.  i was to undergo a monthly blood test and see my dermatologist to assess how my body was tolerating the drug and whether i was improving or not.
1574	xanax	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	to help me sleep after having a rapid heartbeat ep	The drug helped relieve the anxiety from worrying about the sudden return of the rapid heartbeat episode that happened at work without warning and under no stress. I was worrying that it would occur again at night while alone or sleeping.	I noticed that after taking the drug for several days I became very irritable and short tempered.  The side effects stopped when I stopped taking the drug.  I have never taken it since. I stopped taking the drug after recalling a collegue of mine taking the drug after the death of her mother.  Her mood and personality changed to anger and paranoia as she was taking it for a long time.	After suffering an exreme onset of a rapid heartbeat at work (it started while I was laughing, believe it or not) I saw a cardiologist who determined that there was nothing physically wrong with me, however I started having problems relaxing and sleeping at night for fear the condition would suddenly return without warning while alone or sleeping (I thought it might lead to a heartattack!).  The doctor gave me a prescription for Zanax which helped, but caused the undesireable side effect.  The condition never occured again.
4000	fosamax	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	osteoporosis	An increase of bone density after a year so I was told I went from being a sever case of osteoporosis to moderate.  I took Fosamax from 2003 to 2007, when my gynocologist switched me to Boniva.  From what I've heard lately, Merck knew of this problem but would not publish information regarding what could happen to other bones.	April 29, 2010 I broke my femur (rt leg) mid-thigh due to a pre-fracture very possibly caused by taking Fosamax.  Clearly from the x-rays my body was trying to heal the fracture.  After walking I would notice an aching at the site about 3-4 months before it broke.  I did not fall hard nor far--just about a foot and landed on my right foot.  This is obviously a huge consequence for taking this drug.	Surgery and rod implanted in my right leg, thigh to knee.  It is also a long recovery and rehabilitation from walker to crutches and cane.  I am taking calcium (Jarrow's Bone-up) twice daily, 50,000 units Vit D weekly, and will have a variety of tests regarding Niacin in about 2 weeks as a follow-up with my primary physician.
4120	chantix	5	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	stop smoking	To cease smoking.  I have a 40 year old habit!	I had constant muscle aches, flue like symptoms, sadness that I could not understand, strong stomach pains,and constant fatigue.  Even combining aspirin and lots of food with my dosage, it did not help. A pleasant side effect were dreams in bold color. Not scary at all.	Take one  1 mg tablet two times per day.  The first several days the dosage was one half until I worked my way up.
625	nortriptyline	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	originally depression, later for chronic pain	good lifting of depressive feelings, reduction in chronic back pain associated with endometriosis and fibromyalgia	Dry mouth and shaky hands . Shakiness subsided in 3-4 days	"Initially given Nortriptyline for depression.  It helped and after months of therapy the decision was made to discontinue.   I noticed an increase in low back pain that I had in the sacral area associated with endometriosis and all over body aches associated with fibromyalgia.

I read that Nortriptyline at that time was being experimentally used for neurological pain so I asked to go back on to see if it helped and it did.
ALthough I eventually had to have a hysterectomy due to the severity of the endometriosis I still had/have to deal with chronic pain of fibromyalgia.  I cannot tolerate the pain without the Nortriptyline 50mg at bedtime.

I would highly recommend a trial of this if you have any chronic pain issues at all.  Although other pain meds may have to be taken occasionally due to severity changes the Nortriptyline for me really cuts that down."
3758	spironolactone	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acne	It greatly reduced acne from moderate, sometimes painful breakouts to rare mild acne without any side effects.

1455	cymbalta	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	situational atypical depression	Cymbalta takes effect quickly -- within days, as opposed to weeks -- and relieves one's sense of hopelessness, futility and fatigue during a deep depression. At higher doses, a sense of purpose and direction to one's life was also restored, allowing the patient (in this case, me) to exercise better judgment and effective follow through on plans and decisions.	I haven't noticed any overt side-effects. For me this medication has been extremely effective and very easy to use.	Two 60 mg. capsules first thing in the morning.
1729	advair-hfa	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	asthma	Considerable difference in management of of chronic asthma. This is the only drug I have taken that has completely changed the way my lifelong asthma was controlled. Relief was immediate and the severity of asthma attacks has considerably lessoned to a degree as opposed to other drugs which supposedly prevented the attack but when one did occur, were life threatening.	None to speak of so far.	Since I began taking Advair it has been a twice a day treatment that remains to this day.
1169	nasarel	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	rhinitis	Prior to using this spray, I had year round nasal problems: unable to breathe out of one or both nostrils.

Personal benefits: i controlled my weight better, skin looked more radiant and menstruation pains were alot less than when i was not on the medication.

School and work performace improved. I have more drive to be productive. I also find that I am much more friendly, talkative, and social. I find myself wanting to talk to my family and catch up with friends. I also have mild depression, and since starting vyvanse I was able to come off Wellbutrin because the Vyvanse gave me a very happy feeling in a natural way. The feeling is only slightly ""euphoric"". This medication makes me feel like a normal person should feel."	Decreased appetite. I have lost 20 pounds over the past six months. I eat one or two small snacks during the day, but at night I will have a meal when the medication begins to wear off. I also drink alot more fluids due to the dry mouth, which is another side effect. Neither of these side effects are bothersome though. I could afford to lose an additional 20 pounds and i'm hoping vyvanse can help me with that. I used to OVER eat, and now i eat only when my body needs the energy, which is good.	"overall I would definitely suggest vyvanse if you are unhappy with your current ADD meds, or if you are thinking about seeing a doctor concerning ADD. I will say that if you are your child is under 18, or irresponsible concerning ""drugs"" be careful and keep an eye on your childs consumption. Even though they say vyvanse is non-addicting, the feeling while on it and the persona it gives is very much desireable in comparison to not taking it. Also, if you are already under weight you should try a natural stimulant like stratera instead."
1761	topamax	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	migraines	I did not experience any treatment benefits from Topamax for my severe and incapacitating migraines. I did not get relief for my migraine headaches. My migraine headaches did not stop. My migraine headaches did not decrease in duration(3 days per migraine) or intensity (severe). I had one - 3 day a week migraine for over seven years.	The Topamax treatment side effects were extreme when I was taking it.  I experienced extreme weight loss, I went from one hundred thirty pounds down to ninety eight pounds.  I experienced mental confusion and had a hard time focusing on anything including family, relationships and work.  I experienced a deep depression and had suicidal ideations that I had never before had. I also experienced loss of my word finding skills.	The treatment details for Topamax which is used to treat seizure disorders was also supposed to treat migraines are as follows.  As the patient I was to take fifty milligrams per day and was told I would lose perhaps two percent of my body weight but that after a thirty day period my migraines would decrease in intensity and decrease in duration.
291	panixine-disperdose	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	mild local skin infection	I cannot say whether this medication was or was not effective because I stopped taking it after 2 doses. I discontinued the medication because the side effects were severe and much worse than the condition prescribed for.	About 24 hours after my second dose I developed sudden acute abdominal pain. I have never had a negative reaction to any medication before, and had rarely had any stomach pain in my life. This pain was so strong and intense almost like the pain of a labor contraction. But alas it was upper abdominal and not coming from my uteris. It came in waves and anything I ate or drank made it worse. I was very close to going to the ER. But since my temp, BP and HR were normal and I did not have any other obvious symptoms I toughed it out with a heating pad and curse words. After 2 days of this torture I finally feel the worst is over. But I will not take this med again.	The initial skin infection is clearing up.
2034	protonix	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	possible ulcer and acid reflux	Heartburn/Acid reflux stopped the first day I took it. I haven't had any issues with heartburn or acid reflux whatsoever. Stomach pain (from possible ulcer-haven't had results back from test to diagnose that) has decreased significantly.	No side effects that I know of, however my father (who also takes protonix) had to discontinue his regimen for a week because of a test he had to have done said his acid reflux came back about 2 days after he stopped and it was 10x worse than it was before treatment.

2295	lexapro	6	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	depression	The treatment benefits were marginal at best.  Mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases.	On the plus side, I experienced no major side effects.  The possible effects can range from nausea to sexual dysfunction, but none were a problem.  However, it is possible to feel a sort of withdrawal.	The pills are administered once a day, daily, for as long as you think it's worth taking them.  The prescribing physician recommended taking Lexapro for at least six months to get the full benefit of its normalizing effects.
3861	levoxyl	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothroidism	I had developed panic attacks and depression. I had other symptoms such as small weight gain, hair thinning, very tired and slept allot.  The doctor originally thought that I simply had depression so she prescribed an anit-depressant.  After about a year things still were not right.  So she did a thyroid panel.  She quicky got me on a regular dosage and the panic and depression went away along with most of the other symptoms.	No side affects from the treatment that I can think of.	Take one pill first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and wait at least an hour to eat.

This would go away a 1-2 hours after waking. If taken more then 2-3 times a week it was less effective unless dose was increased.	"Regulated sleep by only allowing 6 hrs of sleep a night.

Currently I only need it once a week."
24	alprazolam	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	I found that episodes of anxiety were less frequent and less severe. I was not as edgy or easily startled.	During the day, there were times I was drowsy and did not feel it was safe to take the medication, as I had to be alert for driving or for concentrating at work.

2876	avita	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Produced considerable clarity in my skin and cleared up deep acne without scarring.	I had extremely dry skin, some temporary redness and peeling of my facial skin.  At times it was extensive enough to require a heavy moisturizer.	I took an oral dose of acutane along with the facial creme, Micro-A tretinoin to dry up the oil my face was producing.

3438	tazorac	5	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	hyperpigmentation, light breakouts, fine lines	There was very minimal difference in lines- no noticable change in the melasma. I beleive I am taking the lowest dose and may have benefitted from switching to the more potent formula. I was cautious to do so as I was advised there may be considerable redness & peeling.	"Peeling skin, redness
Other than sperficial side effects, I did not notice anything else, nothing too uncomfortable. My skin seemes a little bit drier, which is why it was peeling.. I suppose that is how the pharmaceutical company thinks it will help with the fine lines by peeling off layers of skin"	Nightly application OVER moisturizer to help correct melasma(Age spots, hyperpigmentation)and fine lines as well as reduce acne breakouts.

2335	propecia	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hair thinning	When I started taking Propercia, my hair loss had stopped and the thinning has not exacerbated. Since taking the drug 10 years ago, my hair remained full and I have not had any side effects.	While side effects may include loss of sex drive and gynecomastia, I did not experience either of these side effects.	Taking a pill daily in the morning.

On a few occasions, mild nausea immediately after taking the drug.	Twice daily, and then stepped down to once daily after a new doctor recommended that the patient only use one per day for prevention, due to slim size (110 pounds).
1183	prozac	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	antidepressant	Initilly uplift in mood and sensory clarity	"the side effect is noticable when usage is stopped. An under-reaction to situations that needed more intensity. ""Too Mellow"" even at the least dose 20mg.After being off this med, my children informed me that they liked me better when I was "" too easy"" and would give in to them.
While taking this medication it stopped working, confused, burst into tears, then just ""change my mind"", hyper ventillation. this was very frightening as I was taking the medication, it was increased and I felt that I was ""losing it"", not knowing that the medication had failed"	"Initial weaning onto medication, then basically tweaking med as observed by practictioner with therapy. I decided to end the medication as it was not doing anything as a life benefit. this medication simply masks symptoms so that the patient ""feels"" functional.And most importantly, I no longer trusted it. I also now believe that DSM diagnois, as used in the general public (myself included) excuses inept doctors from forming medical diagnosis, doing the investigative work and testing to EXCLUDE biological conditions. Why do I think this? My 14 year old daughter ""mentally crashed"" and it was her thyroid, which affects among other organs THE BRAIN. My thyroid tests has been flucuating, but, since the medical doctor stated "" I don't know if I should treat you for hyper or hypothyroid....I got dumped into DSM and prozac. A travesty."
1731	topamax	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	post traumatic stress syndrom	Decreased appetite/impulse or emotional eating, stress reduction, anti depressant	vision affects - blurry vision	I believe that the topamax has helped me to lose 90 pounds of excess weight - I still need to lose at least another 50 pounds.    It helped stabalize my moods and I didn't feel so sad and depressed after going through an abusive marriage/separation then divorce.  My psychiatrist prescribed Topamax during that time.   Then I was able to discontinue treatment for about 2 years.   I then had an accident, where I was then diagnosed with PTSD and fibromyalgia as a result of the accident and have since been on Topamax for two years steady since the accident.   I have lost the weight in the last 16 months.

527	requip	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	restless leg syndrome	If I take requip several hours before sleep it keeps my legs calm for the most part.  Requip seemed like a miracle the first few years then it seems it didn't work as well.  I told my doctor about it and he suggested I take two requip a night instead of one, that also helped for a while.  Im greatful for the medicine although its not a miracle it does help a great deal.	The only side effect I have is IF i skip a night it seems that my problem is much worse.	I try to go to bed the same time every night and I take my requip.
2348	propecia	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	receding hairline	I did find new hairs coming in on my scalp, but only in the middle of my head where I wasn't losing any hair, but that is about it.	After taking this drug for about a half of a year, I decided that the side effects weren't worth feeling miserable...even if that means I was going to be bald.  The first month was okay, but after that I started having many emotional problems due to the hormone balance, I had difficulty receiving an erection, reaching orgasm, or being aroused in any way.  My relationship with my girlfriend suffered greatly. My testicles constantly ached and some days it was hard to concentrate on anything else because I was so uncomfortable.  After being off this medication for a few weeks now, I feel so much better.  Just a few days after I took my last pill I could tell a huge difference in the way I was feeling.  I would never take this medication again.  I believe this company should look at the side effects more and re-evaluate the statistics that they originally advertised.  It says that only about 1% of men experience any problems that I listed above...and it seems like I have read more negative reviews than positive.	1 mg/day
469	remicade	7	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	crohns disease, psoriatic arthritis	skin and joints were better	I could not breath during treatment; first time was fine, 2nd and 3rd times treatment could not be completed; vomiting, felt like throat/lungs were closing up.	an iv infusion in the doctor's office.

Began to experience mental fogginess almost immediately on starting the medication. By the 4 th week I had to take time out from work becasue I was unable to maintain clear thinking.  I also had sleep changes - early awakening.  Probably one of the most disturbing side effects for me was the mood changes I experienced - I was tearful, felt exhausted, and felt nauseous.	stopping treatment

2827	wellbutrin	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	I started with a 150 mg dose and that did next to nothing. I recently increased to 300 mg and then I really started to feel better. I felt kind of hyper and for the first time in ages was able to go back to my gym routine. I noticed a decrease in appetite which in my case is great as I have about 20 lbs to lose. This drug definitely helped with my feelings of worthlessness and failure and with the crying spells.	The worst side effect for me is stomach upset and trips to the bathroom, especially in the morning after I've taken it. The feeling of being all cranked up is good when I have so much to do (others say this wears off) but it also makes me feel a bit anxious and unable to relax. I had mild sleep problems, mainly early waking.	I'm really loving the increase in energy and the lifting of the black cloud, but sometimes I feel a little spinny. Since increasing the doseage I've noticed I've been doing more stupid things than normal, like almost backing up into a truck that I knew was there!!??
1542	vagifem	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	chronic urinary and yeast infections due to drynes	Before the use of vagifem tablets, I had to endure a series of urinary infections after sometimes painful sexual intercourse.

932	levaquin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinus infection	I had a terrible sinus infection with bloodly and puss-y? volumous nasal discharge once every 5 minutes.  Couldn't sleep much.	stomach slightly upset	The first 5 pack dose was taken, on the 3rd day, discharge dramatically slowed down.  After the 5th day, the symptoms had almost cleared, but not completely. Being able to breathe through both nostrils was fantastic. This drug was very expensive ($125/ pack).  After the 9th day I decided to get a refill, as the discharge was returning. After completion of the second pack, symptoms cleared up. Would have been better to have a 6 pack, and I think I waited too long to purchase the second pack.  I didn't like the fact that the infection started to rebuild.

1630	premarin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	post menopausal /hysterectomy	I took Premarin 1.25 after my total hysterectomy in 1992. I stopped taking it in 2003 when the study came out. I looked wonderful. My hair was great, my skin that of a much younger woman. Now, the elasticity is totally gone, I am losing hair and I feel my quality of life has gone downhill. I, also, developed severed osteopenia. I have started back on .625 and plan to take it for 10 more years. My mother in law has been on it for 35 years and looks and feels much younger than her 76 years. I have no risk factors, so I decided it is right for me	none	1.25 for 10 years...had a 6 year break and have decided to go back on it at .625 for a few more years.

There was no bloating, fatigue, moodiness, or any of the other PMS symptoms.	This medication gave me no side-effects.	This is the most remarkable drug available!  Insurance companies REALLY NEED to cover this again!!!
2950	zyban	2	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	to stop smoking	It was the first product I ever tried that actually stopped my desire to quit smoking. Unfortunately due to the severe allergic reaction I had I was no longer able to take it.	I had a severe allergic reaction. It included hive, swelling and internalized into the joints. I had to take steroids to alleviate the reaction	I took the Zyban for three weeks and it helped me to quit smoking, but the side effects/allergic reaction was to severe to continue.

960	sarafem	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	severe depression	A substantial improvement in mood was noticed within a week, hence the quick effect was very beneficial. The medication certainly made life much more enjoyable and enabled me to cope with general situations much better. Reduced general irritability.  I took this medication during two pregnancies and found no ill effects of the new borns.	Some anxiety, especially when beginning this medication. Hyperhidrosis of axillae, which I found the most frustrating side effect. Severely reduced libido. Lethargy and general tiredness.	I commenced this treatment due to clinical depression. I started off at a dose of 20mg a day and after initial improvement found that I needed an increase in the dose to 40mg per day. This seems to work more effectively for me. I became pregnant after approximately 10 months on the medication. I continued on with the same dose throughout the entire pregnancy. I did not breast feed. I then became pregnant very quickly again and continued on the medication for this pregnancy as well. Once again I did not breast feed. I have at times reduced my dose to 20mg which has been fine, however if I suffer a depressive episode I increase it to 40mg and generally find this is what I need to stay on.
1499	metrogel	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	rosacea	"After 15 years of ineffective medications, I finally got my rosacea under control with Metrogel. I still have occasional flare-ups, but with nowhere near the intensity or frequency I had them before. I wish I had discovered this medication years earlier. 

I see a lot of people here saying they abandoned MetroGel after a few days because it initially made their rosacea worse. I had the same experience, but pushed through, and found that it worked wonders by the 2nd or 3rd week. You just have to deal with looking awful for a week or two. Like I said, it's not perfect, but it really has made life a lot better for me. I just hope it remains effective until they find a cure (ha!)."	A little stinging, but nothing serious	I just rub a little one every night, and occasionally skip a few days.
25	alprazolam	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety, panic attck, nervousness	I experienced Xannax more effective for anxiety and panic attacks.	"I didn't feel any alarming side effects from this medication even after using for  over 8 years. 
The feeling of dependency doesn't bother as we are sometimes addict of certain foods also."	"First I experienced the state of anxiety and panic at the age of 20. Starting with Librium I was successful to managed and control my mood and over sensitive nature.
Regular exercise, food and lively hobbies helped to relieve me form all sedative and tranquilizers.
It was, probably, job related stress and tension what triggered the state of anxiety and panic.
Now the above-mentioned medications are helping to perform my activities, mostly as a normal person."

2210	advair-diskus	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	copd	At first it helped.	I did not realize at first that they were side effects. I thought that my chronic bronchitis had gotten much worse. Then I began to develop bouts of extreme fatigue, anxiety and occasional panic attacks that had nothing to do with COPD. Then I started to have choking fits. They were becoming so serious that I feared choking to death. I suspected Advair, so I tried not taking it and then taking it again. The cause was identified and I stopped taking Advair. The choking fits ceased. The fatigue, anxiety, and panic attacks were found to be a malfunciton of my adrenal gland (confimed by lab tests). The chronic bronchitis improved dramatically.	"I was diagnosed with COPD about 12 years ago. I started taking Advair about eight years ago. During the course of treatment I tried Spiriva, but had to stop because it was very drying. At one time I was taking Singulair, but that didn't seem to do much of anything. So I quit that. Throughout the entire period I have used Duoneb and Zyrtec. I think I was originally put on 250/50 Advair. That was increased, some years back, to 500/50, and about two years ago reduced back to 250/50. At all times I used the Advair twice a day.

My pulmonologist (also primary care physician) was not much help when I developed side effects, nor did he suggest a substitute treatment when I had to stop using Advair. I went to another doctor who treated me for adrenal fatigue and had me take natural anti-inflammatories and mucolytics to replace the Advair. I still take Duoneb and Zyrtec. I stopped taking the Advair one year ago. I am just now recovering from the adrenal problem. My COPD has not worsened."

The color of my lashes remained the same. I also feel that there might be a slight increase in the overall thickness.	eyelids were a little itchy at first. They were also a little red.

Its unknown what synergistic effect , if any can be attributed to Clomid for low T and levoxyl for low thyroid function, which were prescribed at the same time as the trilipix..

"I seemed to metabolized the drug quickly. Onset was rapid and anxiety producing. The extended release did  not work for me. I was tried on a variety of doses, from several small doses through out the day, with minimal effectiveness, to several higher doses per day, up to 20mg 3x a day in combination with Xanax to decrease the anxiety. I was not prescribed Xanax prior to the higher doses of Ritalin. That combination worked better than the previous, but I felt drugged out a lot. So my doctor put me on 20 mg at 6am, and noon, with a small 5-10mg dose in the evening, and Xanax only as needed. I learned to live with the anxiety and work around it. I planned my doses where the onset(1 hour) would occur when I was alone or in only with a small group of people. I had to plan everything around the Ritalin to survive with the anxiety, but it was very difficult. But it was the only way I could keep a job. Without the Ritalin I was unable to concentrate enough at work to remain employed. 

Eventually my doctor retired, and I went to a psychiatrist who has ADHD himself, and he prescribes Adderall, 20mg early morning and noon, and 10 mg mid  afternoon.  The sustained release doesn't work well overall for me. My focus isn't as strong as it was on Ritalin, but there is no problem with anxiety, and I don't need the Xanax."
1656	clomid	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	female problems, trying to get pregnant, ovulation	"One thing that Clomid does is aids in maturing the eggs.. many women ovulate, but the eggs that are released aren't reaching ""full maturity"" beforehand. An egg that isn't ""mature"" usually cannot be fertilized...this was part of my case (Clomid certainly does other things to aid in getting pregnant and ovulating, etc). I took Clomid for YEARS. Conceived my daughter on Clomid the first month (she's now 13 yrs old), but also took it for years after that with no luck....eventually got pg with no outside help."

2953	zyban	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	smoking	I gave up smoking fo four months after taking Zyban for 10 weeks	Zyban made me not care about smoking, it also made me not care about anything else, not exactly depressed - just nothing seemed worthwhle.	I took Zyban for 10 days before my quit day, then quit smoking and continued with the Zyban for a further 8 weeks. During that time I smoked on three or four occasions, mostly part of my husband's cigarette. I was really pleased with how I had done, and thought I had finally managed to kick the habit. But on holiday with a lot of smokers I gave in and smoked, thinking I would stop again when I got home - unfortunately that didn't happen.
3550	cardura-xl	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	bph	Increased urinary flow w/o the side effects of Flomax (decreased erectile strength). Available strengths are more varied with Cardura, thus effectiveness can be achieved with minimal dosage.	"None with Cardura. I switched from Flomax because the minimum dosage of 4 mg reduced libido and erectile strength. Not completely, but ""half-mast"" so to speak."	1 2mg tablet at night. Must be taken at the same time as effects last only 22-24 hours. This medication is also used to lower blood pressure, but at the dosage I am taking, my BP remains in the normal range of 75-80.

1026	vyvanse	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	adult add	With this medication versus other drugs to treat ADD, I do not experience a coming down off of something effect. It is highly effective without the severe side effects of comparable medications to treat the same condition. Also, it does not destroy my appetite and I feel healthier with particular medication. I don�t experience dry mouth (but I have always been a huge water drinker!), nervousness, irritability, insomnia, or that racing heart feeling.	Appetite is reduced, but not to an un-healthy degree. Smaller portions at both meal time and snack time are all that you can manage during the day. However, in my experience I eat normal dinner portions. In fact, I feel that with this medication I am eating ample, healthy portions for my gender, body-type and build.  It should be noted that with this and other medications like it you are often so focused it is easy to forget to eat, but it will catch up with you later in the day. You will want the portions you should have had, but no longer have the hours left to spread them out. I set a timer to remind me it�s time to stop and have lunch.	I take this medication once each morning and it lasts throughout the day and into the early evening. With this medication you must see your provider every six months to evaluate weight changes and effectiveness. During the 2 checks that I have had my weight has been consistent. Luckily, dosage has not been modified; we started out with the correct dosage. Although, from what I understand that is rare, dosages often have to be modified to find what works best for each individual.
2200	boniva	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	osteoporosis	None. Due to side effects I was only able to take a single dose. I am now hoping that I do not have permanent damage from the single dose. Time will tell.	Extreme agonizing bone pain in neck and ribs; high fever for 1 1/2 days; debilitating pain in shoulder and neck to the point that I could not get out of bed for 4 days. I subsequently read that it can aggravate previous injuries where bones have been broken or damaged. I had an earlier neck injury and compression fractures in my spine. I believe these old injuries were antagonized by the Boniva.	In order to counteract the side effects I took Benadryl for a possible allergic reaction and Prednisone to reduce inflammation. Had to take 2 Tylenol every 6 hours for pain. This drug has not had anywhere near enough testing. In the aftermath of my experience I have now heard for 4 seperate people that they know or heard of someone with a bad Boniva experience. This drug was once a solvent / cleaning product in industry. How on earth did it ever get fed to mammals to see the effect on bone loss / bone growth? I will never take it again, even if I wind up only 4 feet tall. It is a horrible drug.
753	flonase	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergies	Decreased sensitivity to Ragweed pollens during Fall season.	With extended use I was prone to ulcers in the nasal cavities.	Treatment was started one week prior to beginning of Ragweed season and continued at full dosage till one week past peak season. Dosage was then decreased by 50% till end of season.
3349	lipitor	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	reduce cholesterol	Reduced cholesterol 35 points to 185, down from 230.  I also increased exercise and reduced red meats and eliminated french fries.	I didn't observe any side effects.	Pretty simple!  Take one tablet each morning.  I also changed my morning diet from having fruit and an oat bran muffin to having fruit and oatmeal cereal (whole rolled oats fortified with one tablespoon of oat bran and two tablespoons of dried cranberries).
3954	prilosec	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	severe indigestion diagnosed as possible ulcer	Although I was meant to take these daily, I felt my condition had arisen mainly due to a major change in diet. Being someone who doesn't like to take drugs regularly I decided to use on an as needs basis, so I now take if I feel the regular need to burp and have the early signs of indegestion (i.e. a knotty feeling in the centre of my chest, below the breast bone. For me, this drug acts quite quickly (about 15 mins) and goes a long way to alleviate the symptoms.	None	Not sure I understand this request! I was prescribed a daily dose for 28 days but use on an as needs basis.
3872	levoxyl	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	thyroid disease	The benefits I received from treatment with this Unihroid drug was that my thyroid hormone levels fell back within normal range according to the many thyroid hormone profile blood tests, TSH, T3 etc. which was ordered by thyroid specialist. Another benefit from Unithroid drug was that the goiter which I had developed prior to Unithroid treatment which had become increasingly larger had finally gone down to the point that my neck actually looked normal again.	My freaking hair has fallen out to the point that I am almost bald in front and around the front edges of my hair. My hair has been falling out since I began treatment with Unithroid and continues to shed today. My hair is practically bald in front and the hair on the the top and back of my head has fallen out so much that the once extremely thick hair I had is now thin, and breaks easily. From the hundreds of complaints I keep reading from other thyroid patients on the web, it appears that I am not alone in my dilemma, but to date, myself and the other hundreds of thyroid patients complaining of the same problem have yet to find a safe natural hair product to grow back hairloss from thyroid disease. Other side effects are sometimes depending on what I eat or the time of day, my pulse starts racing.	Not sure theres much to describe. I had a noticeable goiter and went to get it checked. My previous thyroid doctor gave me an iodine uptake scan, took my bloodwork and diagnosed me with Hashimotos disease. Thyroid doctor said the best thing was to let my thyroid burn itself out and then he would put me on thyroid medicine, something I now feel was a mistake and should not have been done. Per my initial thyroid doctor, Hashimotos is sometimes hard to stabilize, thus, the Unithroid drug dosage I initially received .75 mcg had to be re-adjusted several times during the first year in order to stabilize my thyroid levels. Dosage was increased to 100 mcg. then to 125 mcg. then increased to 150 mcg. At some point, during these adjustments I went to another thyroid doctor who prescribed the T3 drug called Cytomel which gave me violent heart palpitations and I was taken off of this drug. The last Unithroid prescription dosage re-adustment I was given was for 150 mcg. 1xday 6 days wk with 1/2 dosage to be taken on Sundays. Medication to be taken on an empty stomach every morning. Last year, my body became Toxic to the Unithroid as I hadn't been to see the doctor in a while and had to be taken off the medication entirely for several days. Was restarted at a low dose of 50 mcg. because the toxicity had caused my pulse to race abnormally interupting my daily activities. This dosage was gradually increased I am now being treated with a Unithroid dosage of 125 mcg. For whatever reason, this survey is being taken, it would be a blessing to myself and so many others if for once someone would develop a natural alternative to drugs like Unithroid, Synthroid etc. other than the natural alternatives on the market that are derived from Pigs glands considering more people than not today do not intake pork products of any kind.

3068	oxycodone	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	metastasized ovarian cancer/chemotherapy	One year after diagnosis, surgery and beginning chemotherapy for stage IIIc ovarian cancer, I am working 35+ hours per week and living more or less normally while receiving biweekly chemotherapy treatments.  Taking oxycodone makes all the difference in my quality of life, because it allows me to live without otherwise constant pain in my back, ribcage and belly.  In the absence of this pain, my mobility/activity level is excellent, I can think and focus clearly, and I am free of the depression and frustration of what could be a debilitating illness.	Occasional fogginess if otherwise fatigued; otherwise, I am surprised at the absence of noticeable side effects.	As I am aware of the addictive potential of narcotics/opioids, I have deliberately requested a continued low dose (5 mg) and have made a point of not increasing frequency to more than three tablets a day.  During the week after chemo, I will sometimes experience a bit of breakthrough pain between doses, and will then take a low (325 mg) dose of acetaminophen.

I've been taking this drug for 6 years now and I have no problem staying awake, sharp and focused. I no longer even drink coffee at night when I'm at work. This drug has changed my life.	When I first started, I was taking 200mg before shift. It gave me the jitters and a headache. But when I went to 100mg that took care of that problem.	"Started off taking 200mg before a 12 hour shift, which made me have the jitters and a headache at times. So I then started taking 100mg before my night shift began and would take another 100mg 4-6 hours later. This stopped the headaches and jitters. On day shift I would take a 100mg, if needed. 
When I get home in the morning and go to bed, my mind will not stop thinking and I could easliy lay there for hours. My doctor prescribed Ambien and if I take that 10 minutes before going to bed I will fall right to sleep."

3930	nexium	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	gastric esophageal reflux	Prior to treatment, patient had severe reflux.  She couldn't lie flat to sleep because of the reflux of acid into the esophagus.  She often had such pain from the reflux that she only slept 3-4 hours a night.	Within 2 days the reflux symptoms were controlled.  She only had problems if she ate an excessive amount late in the evening and needed to sleep on a wedge to prevent sudden reflux while asleep.  She has noticed that if she does not take the Nexium, the symptoms reappear within 2-3 days.	THe patient had been treated with Prilosec for reflux.  While being evaluated for chronic insomnia, a 24 hour study was done to constantly measure the pH of her stomach/esophagus junction.  The study found, while using Prilosec, her stomach acid was 10 times what was considered normal.  She began using Nexium and repeated the 24 hour acid study about 6 months later.  Using Nexium, the stomach acid pH was normal.  The patient takes Nexium once a day, in the morning one hour prior to eating.

You MUST keep it on you at all times so that you are able to do so.  Missing a dose would often induce my period which would linger for weeks.  I also noticed a dramatic difference in the quality of my hair.  Over the last few years of taking the medication I have lost over 75 percent of the super thick head of hair I once had.	The treatment is relatively simple and safe.  It is also supposed to decrease your chance of cervical cancer.  Take one pill each day and there is a 99 percent chance of not getting pregnant.

774	naproxen	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	frozen shoulder	the medication did not benefit my shoulder pain at all.  The orthopedic doctor felt it would eventually kick in, but for me, it never did and didn't do anything to help.  It had adverse affects.  He was a very caring doctor who was trying to lessen the severe pain I experienced.	the treatment caused my blood pressure to increase quickly - within a week or so - to very high blood pressure.  I found that I was very nervous and felt horrid, dizzy.  I went to a GP who took me off of it.	the treatment was for a frozen shoulder.  I had a lot of pain and could not sleep at night on my back or side. I could only sleep sitting up for a few hours at a time. It was hard to move.  Physical therapy eventually helped and taking Tylenol products.  I had many sleepless nights.  I went off the medication after three weeks since the effects for me were not helpful and had terrible side effects.
640	seasonique	3	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	birth control	Well, I didnt have any babies, so I guess Seasonique did its job. My pimples cleard up.	Horrible HORRIBLE nausea for the first month or so. And I would vomit almost everyday, whether I ate something or not, it didnt matter, it was coming up. Sometimes eatting something would help, and sometimes I actually didnt throw up. But if I didnt eat anything, then it was guarenteed I would be paying a visit to my good friend: the toilet. I would usually take my pill at 8 in the morning, and the nausea would finally end around 3pm. This happned EVERYDAY. But around month 2 is where it would be ok, till month three, where I would have light spotting, then it would get heavier and heavier till it was as if I was having a full blown period.	"I have taken this about 3 different times, for three months at a time because thats what the doctor gave me. But this past time of taking it, I remember thinking ""This is so not worth it!"" as I couched over the toilet. So I recently switched to Ortho Cyclen and and going to test this one out to see if its any better. 

Seasonique is not bad, perhaps it was just me with the horrible side effects, but I will probably never take this ever again."

2347	propecia	8	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	hair loss	I found that the Propecia did seem to counteract my hair loss. However, it did not do much for the hair I had already lost. I've been taking it for three years now and I have not seen any more receding, and my hair seems thicker than it used to be.	They say that a major side effect could be impotence and a loss of sexual desire, but I did not experience either of those. Other than that, I can not really think of any other side effects I have experienced with Propecia over the last three years.	I take one pill each day. Sometimes when my prescription runs out, I am forced to miss a few days, but I do not notice any changes as I think the medicine takes a longer time to work and stop working. I've worked it into my daily routine and although I do not like having to take a pill every day at 22 it has not been a problem.
3678	effexor-xr	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	Instead of curing my depression, this drug made me feel completely flat.	Besides the extreme flatness, there were not many at time of treatment; however, I had severe cramps and diarrhea getting off of it	I had been on Zoloft for 5 years with no problems. After a while it had been less effective, and my doctor cycled me rapidly through other drugs that did not work well. I had been inpatient for a week because treatment had been going so poorly. So this drug seemed better, compared to that, for a while, but gradually I noticed that I didn't so much feel better as that I just didn't feel anything at all.

Also to note, patient showed a general improvement in social and educational functions as expressed in an academic report.	Increased insomnia with a decrease in appetite, as common with this medication.	The patient was asked to participate in active counseling in addition to the medication. Some of the compulsions appear to correlate to stress induced anxiety, so the patient was urged to stop, breathe, relax, before attempting a stressful (or habitual) activity.  I also found it necessary to inform the patient of the current paradigm on his condition as well as offer alternative treatments.
1405	adipex-p	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	appetite suppression	decrease in appetite and increase in energy	dry mouth, decreased sleep	while taking it did a good job decreasing appetite but when it was stopped appetite increased substatially.
1589	xanax	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	I used it for sleep aid as ambien or lunesta never worked for me. I took a half a pill before bed and put me right to sleep. Never had any crazy dreams or sleep-walking episodes. Worked great as a sleep aid.	Sometimes felt a little tired in morning, sometimes groggy. But nothing a latte can't fix.	Took it before bed so I could fall asleep. Never woke up in the middle of the night.
1205	prozac	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Taking Prozac has helped me to live a normal life. I was having a serious bout of depression when I first started taking Prozac, and the drug lifted the symptoms of extreme hopelessness and racing negative thoughts. I've tried to go off the medication but whenever I do, negative thoughts and the resulting emotions return. When I resume taking Prozac, the symptoms subside. The medicine allows me to challenge thoughts rather than react to them.	I have problems sleeping--not falling asleep but staying asleep. I sometimes feel nervous (that is, nervous energy, not anxiety). I'd also say that Prozac can make me feel numb, but it's better than being severely depressed. Overall, the side effects aren't bad enough for me to stop treatment or look for another medication.	I've been taking 40 mg. of Prozac once a day for about 20 years (I started taking it about the time it first became available.)

2870	aldactone	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	adult acne	Results were almost immediate. My mild cystic acne went away just after taking the pills for a week. Two months later, it's still gone.	I felt a little light-headed for the first 2-3 days. Otherwise, none.	I've had mild cystic acne as long as I can remember. The only time I didn't was when I was on BC pills. Over the course of 7 years, I've taken doxycyline, minocin and Doryx, all which initially helped somewhat. From the beginning, I tried to get my dermatologists to address the hormonal angle. Seven years later, someone finally listened. A couple months ago I started on 75 mg once a day and have had no breakouts since. Not sure how long she'll keep me on this regimen.
1158	septra	5	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	prevention of pcp pneumonia while on chemo	The baby did not contract PCP pneumonia. However, he was most likely never exposed to it either. Its effectiveness then is unknown.	Baby had a facial rash during the use of this drug. Other possible side effects are yet unknown as he has only recently discontinued use. Rash has yet to clear up after one week off the drug. The rash may not be an actual side effect of the drug, though it has been shown in studies to be.	The drug was given to prevent PCP pneumonia while the baby had a compromised immune system due to receiving a course of chemotherapy.

2092	selegiline	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	attention deficit problems, concentration difficul	During the first two weeks no notable benefits, but after that there was a distinct difference; the brain fog seemed to have disappeared, general mental state and motivation improved. However, there was no significant change as to the ability to concentrate which continued to be as poor as before. On doctor's advice the dosage was increased to 20mg per day but due to side-effects on that dose had to return to the previous dose (10mg daily)	On the larger dosage of 20mg per day: dizziness, rapid heart rate, general feeling  of nausea	See as stated above. Since this drug didn't really work on add-symptoms as efficiently as was expected the patient will ask her neurologist for a prescription of either Ritalin or Concerta or something similar especially for improving concentration.
1110	effexor	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Significant remission from a major depressive disorder that had been present throughout childhood and into my adult life. One day I just could not get out of bed - the depression was so bad that my father took me to the doctor who handed me a sample pack provided to him by a drug rep. The Effexor was a life saving medication.	I did experience some  taking ignificant side effects as a result of taking effexor. THese included major sexual disfunction, chrinic tireness, apathy  and a numb state of being. I felt that the medication made me feel like I was just zombing through work and social life.

Small amount of the ointment was applied twice per day for three weeks and the spots gradually reduced in size and dissapeared.  Because this is a very strong medication it was applied somewhat sparingly to be conservative and it still worked.
2834	singulair	2	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	asthma, allergies	some reduction in lung inflammation	Severe mood swings, depression, frequent lung infections	"I took singulair for years before I realized that it was not really doing much and I strongly suspect that it contributed to my severe depression and mood swings.  I have always had severe asthma and allergies and was hospitalized many times as a youngster.  I did have allergy shots which I truly think helped with my allergies.  When I got older, and inhaled cortisteroids were invented I started taking them, along with Singulair.  I was told that it was the ""most benign medication that I was on"" so I never thought twice about popping that small pill each day.  I suffered from frequent chest infections - that is a side effect of the singulair since it blocks the leuketrines that react and cause inflammation.  When I was 25, I started having severe mood swings and had to start taking an anti-depressant.  I continued the singulair without any thoughts.  However, after my third child, we were broke and I was trying to cut some medications down to save money and I stopped the singulair for a while.  I did notice that my asthma got worse so I figured oh well, have to start the Singulair again, that's when I started having the severe mood swings again.  I started doing some research online and read an article written by a mother who lost her son to suicide and attributed it to the singulair.  In my heart of hearts, I truly believe that more attention should be given to this drug, and it's affects on the brain.  I am no longer taking it and I am having much better luck with zyrtec."
2071	metformin	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	diabetes	Apparantly this drug helps to use the sugars be of use to the body, so my sugar levels went down.	I had gastrointestinal upset, including diarrhea, cramps, and nausea. Since I took a combination of drugs when beginning treatment, I am not sure which one caused a weight gain.

876	paxil	2	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	recovery from a brainstem stroke	to treat depression commonly caused by stroke. They say stroke and being a woman, 99% chance of depression, like a roller coaster early on..	Made me feel like a zombie, slowed me in my emotional resilancy recovery and I also gained 10 lbs pretty fast..	To help me thru the early stages of the grief process in stroke recovery, which I guess it did, my emtotions were volatile at times, very hard time emotionally for a bit.  But I hated the numb feeling it gave me and worried me how I would react (if it would be too slow) if my kids had some sort of emergency..they were 5 and 6th grade at the time.
3132	duragesic	6	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis joint pain, fibromyalgia	Relief from hip and shoulder pain, tingling painful feet in the mornings when I would first walk around. I also received relief from lower back pain and as such allowed for better sleep to occur. There is also comfort in knowing that as my illness progresses and as I age that relief is out there for me when and if I choose to use it again.	Soemtimes the skin where the patch was placed became sore, itchy, red and inflamed. However, the most problematic side effect was during the transition phase between each 30 day prescription. For example, if the pharmacy did not have the product, I would have to go without a patch for a day or two I would experience withdrawal symptoms, jitteriness, crawling skin, sleeplessness with dizziness. The whole ordeal of getting in to see the doctor every 28 days, getting the prescription,, well, it all was getting so stessful I just went cold turkey and quit using them. Which, by the way, was pretty foolish because I had a difficult three days by myself to say the least.	I was having considerable hip and shoulder pain.  Also, I had significant sciatic pain but the sciatica pain was not as chronic as the shoulder pain.  While using the fentanyl patch I was given facet block injections and as a result have had little problem with the sciatica.  The fentanyl patch also relieved tingling pins and nnedle like pain in my feet that I had in the mornings when I first woke up and put even a little of my weight down on my feet.  For me the patches served me for the time that I was using them.  I am however, glad that for now I do not currently use them.

Still have moments where hyperthyroidism hits, but this is early in treatment, however, this drug took me from a very poor life, oversleeping, shaky, blurred vision, trembling hands, heart jumping out of chest life, and has made me feel very very normal.	The side effects are not seen if any because if the exist they are better than this incredible terrifying experience of hyperthyroid episodes that were haunting, and devistated my life in many areas. Am drinking fluids, one of my side effects of the hyperthyroid was not being able to eat or hold down food, but very hungry all the time. I am on liquids and increase to solids slowly now.	I saw my primary doc, and ER doctor all to be diagnosed as panic attacks. I lived on and off of valum, and other anti depressants, and nothing would ever control, only blanket my tremors and shaky clouded mind. One ER doctor decided to run the thyroid tests that came back positive for Hyperthyroidism. I saw a specialist who then immediately put me on Methimazole 10mg, 1 time a day untile iodine test can be done. Delerious as I was over a week ago, I held couch in lost world of confusion. Tonight my ears stopped popping, ringing is gone, heart beating nice. For this night I believe that the Methimazole is starting to work. I am not tired, and feel like going outside. Unbelievable. If this is the beginning to my life back, this drug has the key to sanity for the upcoming choices for long term treatment and care I must make soon. Note: Due to contrast given in CAT Scan, I must wait 6 weeks to undergo the iodine testing. I understood that the contrast would throw off test results. I assume or am prepared for a relapse because this is a very short time into treatment, but if this is a glimps of what clarity is ahead, a wonderful drug to be treated with.
2842	singulair	2	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	chronic hives	The benefits of the treatment was that the hives that had been present for a minimum of three years were beginning to clear up.  The chronic itchiness that was associated with the hives also began to lessen.  The greatest benefit of taking Singular was that the overall hyper-sensitivity of my skin was finally beginning to lessen.	The side effects of the treatment was extreme tiredness.  This antihistamine caused me to fall asleep at odd times throughout the day.  I am generally a high energy person but Singular caused me to fall asleep almost as soon as I sat down or stopped moving.	"After many tests and a variety of test treatments my dermatologist determined a course of Singular would be the best course of treatment for the chrnic hives I was suffering from.  

I began taking it as per his instructions (one tablet nightly before bed).  Within a matter of 2 days I began to feel incredibly tired.  By day 5 I found I was falling asleep at odd times throughout the day.  

I called the dermatologists office and was told to expect some tiredness and to continue with the treatment.  

At the end of one month the tiredness still hadn't subsided.  I returned to the dermatologists office and informed him I could no longer tolerate the side effects.

He stopped the treatment of Singular."

I apply duac once a day to clean dry skin and follow with a moisturizer.

3130	duragesic	2	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	cancer related pain	The Fentanyl patch helped some with pain, however, the patient was still in considerable pain.	On the 4th day on the medication the patient who had been very responsive and alert was groggy, not alert and fell several times in attempts to go to the bathroom, something he had no problem with proir to the medication.  In attempting to assist the patient, it was evident that his heart was beating rapidly and he was in a cold sweat.  He died on the 5th day on the medication.	The patient was suffering from cancer of the esophagus, which was in an advanced state at the time of diagnosis.  The patient was to begin treatment for cancer the day following his death.  He had received a feeding tube through his stomach and was sent home from the hospital with a perscription for Fentanyl patches for pain.  He had previously been taking a much milder medication.

2846	singulair	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	asthma	none	Severe neuropsychiatric side effects, including suicide ideation, nightmares, hallucinations, horrible headaches, anger/hostility, reckless/abnormal behavior, dilated pupils, fatigue, pain in joints.	This drug is poison and should not be given to children.  My daughter was prescribed this for mild asthma.  Doctors don't know or don't care about the dangerous, life-threatening side effects of this drug.  This is Merck's biggest money maker.  There are much more effective, less dangerous treatments for asthma.  Spread the word.  Get active.
1445	cymbalta	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Less pain, better mood	Constipation	Took cymbalta once a day every day
2624	depo-provera	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control	The main benefits were absolutely no pregnancy and no menstrual cycles.	The main side effects, which I noticed more predominately in the later stage of treatment was the contast hunger and weight gain as the result, moderate acne, and depression (I am still being treated for depression so this may not be due to depo, but it is actually one of the side effects).	I started depo-provera when I was 15 years old and continued treatment for five years and then stopped treatment at the suggestion of my doctor to take a break from it.  During the first ive years on depo, I had no adverse effects I maintained a constant weight of 112-1/2 pounds throughout the entire five years.  I started depo again at the age of 23 and was fine and maintained a constant weight until they switched me to the generic version at the age of 27 from that point on I struggled with constant hunger rapid weight gain and struggling to keep it under control, acne is another of the side effects I experienced after the switch to generic and depression.  The depression could be the result of fluxuating weight and acne or heredity.  I stopped depo treatment and switched to the copper IUD in November of 2007 and since then the constant hunger has stopped, I have already lost 10 pounds without really trying and the acne is beginning to decrease.  I still am receiving treatment for depression at the moment.  Hopefully, this will help you in your birth control decision.
209	elidel	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypothryoid-related dry skin	Elidel reduced my dry skin by about 80-85%. It increased exfoliation, which is very slowed down in hypothyroid-related dry skin, got rid of many of the blocked pores due to poor exfoliation, and stopped the vast majority of the flaking, burning, and redness I had suffered from before I used it.	The first week I used Elidel I got some flu-like symptoms, as warned on the package insert. It stands to reason that Elidel would make one very sun-sensitive, as it shuts down the skin's immune system; I didn't have a problem with this, as I always wore sunscreen, but it made me nervous. As I understand it, Elidel isn't formulated to help the skin help itself; instead it just shuts off the skin's erroneous response. For some skin conditions, this is sufficient, but it wasn't for me.	After washing my face with gentle cleanser, I applied a small amount of Elidel to my entire face, before following up with a moisturizer (or two), then sunscreen.
3237	nuvaring	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	birth control	Nuvaring is so easy for my because I never have to worry if I forgot to take my pill.

Aggression was significant. I became very quick tempered, which in uncharacteristic for my personality type. Libido was not improved.	"I have a ""slow"" brain. Specifically I have what soem researchers refer to as ""sluggish cognitive tempo"". Taking a drug that has some dopaminergic activity could theoretically improve certain parts of the symptomology."
1977	lyrica	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	chronic pain	I experienced a Reduction in my chronic pain by about  fifty per cent once i was takiing the maximum dose of 300mg twice per day.I have this chronic pain for the past 19 years and have tried everything.  This is the first time that anything has made any difference.	When I first started on the maximum dose of 300 mg twice a day I did experience dizziness,mild muscle twitching, short term memory problems and constipation.  The dizziness and muscle twitching did ease off after about 6 weeks but I still have constipation and seem to have difficulty remembering certain things.	I started on 50 mg twice daily and I was got no reduction in pain, my doctor gradually increased the dose to 300mg twice daily. Once I was on the maximum dose, I started to experience some dizziness etc as outlined above.  However some of the  Side effects became less obvious after about 6 weeks on the maximum dose.  It was worth it because I was feeling a reduction in my pain levels for the first time in 19 years
2656	diclofenac	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	arthritis	I had side effects from taking Celebrex so doctor changed to this one. Marked difference in pain (relief) and ability to have better use of hands.	none	"i have degenerative osteoarthritis in both thumb joints. They become very inflamed after use and will at points just stop working (can't hold anything)
The use of the diclofenic greatly reduces the inflamation and allows me to use my hands for longer periods of time. I am undergoing plasma injection therapy at this time and its a requirement to stop taking all anti-inflamatories one week prior to treatment. Long week. Hands were much more inflamed and irritated without the use of diclofenac."

The paid seised for six hours before another dosage was needed.	The treatment was effective for reducing paid however I felt extremely depressed while taking the dosage. I had emotional swings and did not want to leave the house which is not common for me. Once I was no longer taking the drug I was back to normal.	I took the prescription for one week when my burn started to heal.
2184	clonazepam	3	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	blepharospasm	Very slight reduction in muscle spasms around eyes.  Ended up also getting light Botox injections in eyelid muscles.  This combo therapy has not resulted in a total cessation of eyelid spasms, but has reduced them enough so that I can drive again (the main disability caused by the blepharospasm).  Taking the clonazepam at night also helps me get a better night's rest than before I took it.	The first few days I took it I was dizzy and very sleepy.  However, those side effects have now subsided.	Take 1 MG tab at night before bed.  As mentioned above, also got Botox injections to reduce eyelid spasmx.

Irritability at times and difficulty sleeping,heart palpitations and some sexual dysfunction.	I have had post-partum depression severely with each of my children.(I have 3.) In addition to the Bi-Polar disorder I have lived with most of my life. The post-partum is very scary.I knew before my 3rd child was born what I would be in for,so I was ready this time and armed with Wellbutrin.It is definitely not a cure-all, more like a bandaid,but the bandaid helped get us through the last 8 months,while being more able to work on the root of the problems through counseling.

The frequency reduced to the usual of a few times in 24 hours depending on how much I drank.	none noticed	cystoscopy at 48 hours showed many mucosal bladder hemorrhages. Drank more liquids and fresh fruits, and took it easy in activities. Drank no wine, and stayed close to toilet for 24 hours!
3663	effexor-xr	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	high level anxiety/depression	Unlike other anti-depressents which appeared to completely depress all emotional feeling and expression and lower energy levels, this drug appeared to free the patient from the high level of anxiety while allowing 'normal' emotional functioning. It appeared to stabalise the situation without comprimising the patients ability to perform normal work functions.	There was some drowsiness after taking the capsule, and therefore it was taken at night.	One capsule per day, taken in the evening.
2159	zyrtec	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	skin allergy	I suffer from itching from different causes - clothes, shower gel, even just hot water. In about forty mins from taking the drug, the itching stops. The skin redness subsides within 2 or 3 hours, however not entirely.

2438	wellbutrin-sr	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	add	Wellbutrin offers a stable, constant release of medication that by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine results in more dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine to transmit messages to other nerves. Two brain chemicals in particular�dopamine and norepinephrine�are believed to play an important role in the ability to focus and pay attention to tasks.	Sometimes, I find I'm a little more tired when I miss a day.	I was diagnosed with Attention Deficient Disorder 13 years ago, a year after it was discovered that my daughter, then six, had the disorder. Prior to beginning a medication regiment to treat my disorder, I had tendencies toward impulsiveness, and difficulty staying on task, which affected many areas of my life. I have been able to achieve career and personal success that I know would not have been possible prior to taking the medication.
130	valtrex	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	herpes	The product was used to clear up a primary outbreak of herpes.  It was said to speed up the process of healing.  I took the product for the prescribed amount of time and can say that it did shorten the timeframe in half.	The first coupel of day, there was nausausness and some tiredness.	take one pill orally once per day for two weeks.
1734	topamax	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	weight loss	Topamax decrease my appetite significantly.  I lost an average of 15 pounds per month while taking the 50 mg/day. I had no side effects during the course of the treatment, the only real drawback was the need to taper off the drug slowly rather than just being able to stop taking it.	I experienced no side effects.	"IT took a month to find the correct dosage for me, since the doctor started out at lower dosages and worked up to the 50/mg per day.  
As I neared a better weight, the doctor began tapering off and the weight loss significantly slowed and in fact stopped before I was able to stop taking the medication."
2083	metformin	8	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	polycystic ovarian syndrome	Improved facial acne, lowered blood glucose a little	Mild gastrointestinal issues that subsided after the first few weeks.	Received metformin to treat PCOS. It improved facial acne. However, other anticipated benefits did not occur (no ovulation after going off oral contraceptives). However, given other long-term benefits of metformin (may act as an anti-cancer agent), I rate this drug highly, since I did not experience any side effects after the first few weeks.
3472	ambien-cr	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia	Helped to fall asleep.	No noticeable side effects, however, time release formula does not seem to work. Drug works for 4 or 5 hours then I wake up as usual in the middle of the night.	I take this in an attempt to stay asleep like the drug promises. I rarely have trouble falling asleep. With Ambien CR, I fall asleep very quickly but still wake up most nights after 4 or 5 hours of sleeping. Therefore, the time release formula does not seem to work with me. In addition, this drug is unbelievably expensive. All in all, neither effective no priced within reason. I would not recommend.
958	sarafem	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Releived moderate depression initially, and helped with anger and irritability control.	Sleeping too much, night sweats, vivid dreams, felt emotionally numb, cravings for carbohydrates and overeating, and had decreased libido.	Started on 20 mg dose for 2 weeks, then increased to 40 mg.  After 4 months the benefits decreased dramatically so switched to another drug, bupropion, but still taking 20 mg of fluoxetine daily.
557	doryx	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acne	"The treatment benefits are:  it controlled my acne and prevented any breakouts. 
The treatment also subsiede the present acne at the time of intake. My skin has cleared and there are no more pustules on my face."	There were no side effects. The important thing is to take it immediaely after dinner. You have to have a full stomach because taking it without any solid food in the stomach couls give you an upset stomach.	The treatment details are simply a taking one tablet daily with dinner or immediately after for a period of thirty days. AFter 30 days, you take it in again at least for another three weeks and then gradually decreasing do there won't be any flair in the effectiveness of the drug.
2431	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	underactive thyroid	Stabilized and regulated the levels of thyroxin in my body.	None.	One pill per day, standard. I'd like to point out that the Brand Name drug works fine, but the generic versions are not as good. I have had the same problem with some other drugs (primarily antibiotics)where the generic was not effective but the brand name product worked fine.
1941	vistaril	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	anxiety	I suffer from an anxiety disorder and have tried several medications. So far Clonazepam has helped me the best.	I would have anxiety attacts more often on Vistaril then any other medications. I have had no side effects from Clonazepam.

1547	methotrexate	6	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	psoriasis	95% cleared chronic severe psoriasis from scalp to feet. Extremely easy to administer.	nausea, fatigue, elevated white blood cells, low side of normal liver lab results.	took 10 mg every 3 hours for a total dose of 30 mg/wk.

2444	wellbutrin-sr	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	It helped with depression and suicidal thoughts.  I was able to sleep better and deal with anxiety and stress better.	dry mouth was the worst side effect but since I should drink more water anyway it was a mixed blessing.	Effexor and Wellbutrin kept my depression under control - I took more during the winter months and less the rest of the year.
201	adderall	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/add	I failed out of school three times before I started to take Adderall.  University once and a local college twice, in two different programs.  Went back and my grades went from D's and F's to B's.  I was able to concentrate and retain information.  I don't have the fatigue, I had and I want to get the day going, instead of laying in bed for as long as I could.  Literally changed my life.	Insomnia, dry mouth, appetite loss.	30mg slow release in the morning.
2981	strattera	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	adhd (predominantly inattentive)	"The ""head made of air"" feeling I tend to have goes away:I become more attentive, much more aware of my surroundings, feel much more grounded in the ""here/now"", and much better able to focus. My mind stops trying to jump from one subject to another every second; memory retention/recall improves DRAMATICALLY. I also find it FAR easier to fall asleep at night, seem to sleep better, and seem to be far more emotionally stable. I also do not ""crash"" from it later in the day like my former (stimulant) meds. Also does not appear to be physically addictive."	Severe grogginess, often accompanied by lightheadedness, upset stomach/nausea - ALL aggravated by sleep loss or lack of food, become slightly less severe after I'd been on it again for a couple of weeks. Severe grogginess was slightly alleviated by caffeine (espresso) or some rest (nap) or both. Best solution appears to be to take the meds with or after food, and to attempt to get a decent amount of sleep. Also notice a certain level of dependence (NOT actual addiction though) - mostly due to return of symptoms in medication's absence. I may also have dry mouth, but I'm not sure if that's the meds or if I'm not drinking enough water.	"Best way I've discovered to eliminate the side effects is to eat a protein-rich breakfast (usually egg/ham/cheese sandwich for me), then WAIT for at least a few minutes -anywhere from 15 to 60 or more- before taking the medication. Seems to retain efficacy, COMPLETELY eliminate stomach problems and GREATLY reduce grogginess -though that also seems to be partly dependent on how much sleep I get (minimum of 6 hours, preferably 8 or 9). Now that I discovered this trick, I am feeling MUCH better and no longer considering abandoning the medication! I like that it helps with sleeping quality on top of helping me focus, remember, and feel more aware of surroundings. Would cry now if I had to go back to not using it - I almost can't function without medication, and the non-stimulant allows me to sleep SO much better and I do not ""crash"" from it!"
2035	protonix	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	chronic heartburn	The heartburn was unrelenting and multiple over the counter acid reducers were tried including taking the generic Over-The-Counter Prilosec twice per day. None of these medications seemed to caused any reduction in heartburn. After starting the Prontonix symptoms disappeared entirely within the first 24 hours. After starting the Protonix I was again able to eat and enjoy any type of food without heartburn, epigastric pain and nausea.	There were no side effects.	Protonix is taken once per day either with or without food. I take my prescription as bedtime.
368	neurontin	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bi-polar disorder	Helped me to eat, not think when I wanted to shut off.  Helped me sleep. a bit of false happiness for moments aw-well.	Hear clicking sounds in my eras.  Saw tiny lights spots ransomly.  I was addicted or I couldnt eat, sleep or even form speech at times.	To blanace my bi-polar, level 5 and help me to sleep.

Very little upset stomach	2 capsules a day for 5 days
3643	retin-a	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	It cured my acne and reduced my wrinkles. This was really the best product I ever used. Common over the counter products and benzoyl didn't work, which was very frustrating. However, the effects are only temporary. As soon as I stop using it, after a few days I will get blackheads again.	I really did experience redness and flaking, like most users did. But that was mainly around the soft tissues, such as my mouth. So I decided to use it more on the trouble areas and less on the other parts. Side effects were reduced after combining with Jojoba Oil.	I applied a pea size every day. You really do have to wait 20 minutes after washing your face before applying, because otherwise you will really have an increase of the side effects. Then wait a bit longer to let it absorb and use a moisturizer which is non comedogenic, like jojoba oil. Worked fine for me! And I have very sensitve skin.
1645	sumatriptan	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	severe migraine	I love imitrex, I could not get by as I have severe Migraines to where I can not function. Some time I will take up with one, but try to catch one if I feel it coming on.  It usally takes me about 45 minutes to and hour with tablets and 5 to 10 minutes with the injections. It is a wonderful drug. I use the generic tablets, cause they are a little cheaper with my insurance	SOme times I will have aching in my hands and my body like arthritis pain.  Feels like arthritis, that is the best way I can describe it, but I would rather have that pain than a migraine.	Treatment, self explainatory, I feel better with the imitrex and do not know how I could get by without it.
2448	adcirca	2	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	difficulty getting/holding erection	I might as well have not taken it at all. I noticed no difference in trying to achieve an erection than without it. When erection was achieved it went away quickly. The strength of erection was minimal. Not impressed at all.	Massive headache an hour or so after ingesting the pill as well as heavy clogged sinuses. Found it hard to breath. Felt like flu symptoms.	The only thing this pill gave me was strong flu-like symptoms. I'll try it again and see if the results are better but so far I'm not impressed at all and $80 in the hole. Complete waste of money and suffered flu symptoms the entire next day. It's very difficult to be in the mood for sex when you feel sick with a throbbing headache.
3951	prilosec	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	gastritis	Eliminated pressure in my upper abdomen and reduced reflux. I have a hiatal hernia so it also helped with acid reflux.	None, but I am concerned about calcium absorption since I have Osteopenia.  I was supplementing with B12.	Dose was once a day.  I've been off it for two months and have some mild symptoms of gastritis.
820	zyrtec-d	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	pollen, dust, mold and tree allergies	"I notice the benefit of being able to be calmer and not so ""on edge"". I am not so short tempered and I am able to handle situations that are mentally or emotionally challenging.  I also notice the benefit of not being very emotional. My physician and I decided to wean me down to 20 mg. and when this happened, I noticed an immediate effect.  I was very short tempered and ""on edge"".  I was also not able to deal with situations that were mentally or emotionally challenging.  I also was very tearful. Needless to say, my physician and I knew I needed to go back on the medication again."	A slightly lowered libido, tiredness in the evening. Also notice I am not as tearful when dealing with emotionally challenging issues, which can have it's pros and cons.	I have been on Prozac for 12 years.  I was titered starting with 20 mg. days, then 40 mg then 60 mg which is my current dose.
1965	lyrica	5	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	spinal nerve compression pain	Perhaps a slight improvement in nerve pain	confusion, short term memory loss. It was like living in a fog.	I took it 3 times daily to help reduce nerve pain from spinal compression that needs to be fused but I did not want another fusion yet so this was one of the medications they put me on when nuerontin at the levels I needed caused some of the same side effects as Lyrica;.
1324	prevacid	5	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	eosinophilic esophagitis	It is difficult to discern if there were any real treatment benefits.  Our son was given Prevacid after being diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis in an attempt to stop frequent bouts of mid-night stomach pain.  It is possible the Prevacid had a mild-moderate impact on his stomach pain but more than likely it was the concurrent dietary modification.	There were no long-term side effects.  The first several evenings his stomach pain seemed to increase so the frequency was reduce to twice daily for the first 2 weeks.	Treatment consisted of Prevacid (1.25 mg) three times a day and at this time the duration is indefinite.  Concurrently his diet was modified, removing wheat, peanuts, dairy and beef, based on a blood based allergy test.  The next phase of evaluation will include a measured DTH response to the identified allergens.
3780	metronidazole	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	bacterial lung infection	I was not able to take the drug long enough to know its benefits.	I took my first dose before bed one night.  In the morning I woke with a cold sore and a very large ulcer on my tongue.  I attributed this to the slight fever I had been running periodically.  My tongue became increasingly sore.  The second pill, later on that day, caused sever stomach pain, cramping, diarhea, nausea, and hot flashes.  The oral pain remained about the same. I took the third, and last, dose that afternoon is the worst experience I have ever had with a drug.  Immediately after taking the pill blisters began to appear wherever the pill had touched my skin.  This included the entirety of my tongue, mouth, lips, and throat.  I called the PA that had prescribed the drug and told her about the reaction.  She told me to discontinue the drug immediately and that was a possible side effect of this drug.  Had I any idea what it was going to be like, and the intense pain I would endure because of it, thenI would never have taken it.	I took 3 pills.  That is all.
1916	avelox	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	sinus infection	None. made me sick to my stomach.	Took medicine with dinner and glass of milk to coat stomach.  Within 40 min. of taking Avelox I knew I would be vomitting.  Upset stomach lingered to next morning.  Won't take again	will need to go back to dr. for another perscription. It's my fault..should never have agreed to take something new.  Had simialr reaction to Augmentin.
256	ultram	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	fibromyalgia	The Tramadol helped minimally at first.  I did stop working for the pain.  I've continued to take it because it helped dramatically for the fatigue, without any jitters.  I honestly could not get out of bed in the morning if it weren't for this drug.	At first, it took my body some time to adjust.  It revved up my system.	My doctor didn't know much about Fibromyalgia, so the only thing he prescribed was the Tramadol.
3695	effexor-xr	8	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression/anxiety	Alleviated all my symptoms with in the first week	"Insomnia
Lack of libido and orgasm
Dry Mouth
Contipation
Minor agitation"	I felt a difference within the first week. I am just so hopeful the side effects start to go away as this drug has saved my marriage and improved my families lives immensely. My main concern so far is the insomnia which was a problem straight away. I have just changed to taking my medication in the mornings, I will see how I go.
3286	zoloft	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	Onset of depression as a result of sudden spouse bereavement, ability to continue to care for children, run household, resume paid work, resistance of negative thoughts and behaviours	nil	Daily dose, reviewed quarterly by treating GP, along with numerous grief counselling sessions, support groups, self help (positive thinking etc), regular exercise program.
3184	desyrel	2	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	anxiety	I slept well, except that was not my problem. I was forced to miss work due to a very deep sleep.	I took this ONCE, upon the reccomendation of a doctor. I soon became very dizzy and was forced to go to sleep. When it was time to wake up, I couldn't. Finally I did, but with an annoying headache. Later in the day, I got a chest pain. The side effects of this pill are too great.	Before Bedtime
1482	cymbalta	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	Significantly reduced anxiety without feeling 'damped down' or 'numbed'. Feel normal, but with reduced anxiety. Compared to short-halflife anti-anxiety medications, no feeling of emotional dependency on a once-daily ongoing regimen.	Generally rarely experience side effects. Taken on an empty stomach, mild transient nausea, but this is quickly addressed with any light snack. Discontinuation syndrome (when I have run out of the medication, or once when discontinued for 2 days due to elective surgery) is quite unpleasant.	Prescribed to act synergistically with stimulants prescribed for ADHD: the stimulants tend to increase anxiety, which also increases the necessary therapeutic dose for the stimulants, so this very low dose of the multiple reuptake inhibitor effectively reduces the dosage needed of the stimulant for therapeutic effect. This combination enabled me to reduce my stimulant dosage by 50% and also decreased my anxiety very substantially--the effect was almost immediately remarked on by my partner as well as in my own subjective opinion.
1710	retin-a-micro	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne/wrinkles	This gel works really well for my acne.  I only had mild acne.  More importantly, the gel improved my fine lines and wrinkles.  I continue to use this product.	The gel is only slightly drying.  I did not experience the side effects that most people report.	I use this product every night.  I would have liked to use a moisturize in conjuction with the product, but the company that produces Retin-A micro discourages it.
2230	allegra	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	The treatment benefits included but were not limited to anti histamine blocker, decongestant, etc. I was sneezing, coughing, had laringitis, allergy shiners, and could not sleep.	There were side effects listed such as dizziness, nausea, hypertension etc. I did not expertise any of the ill side effects/	I went to the doctor for the prescription. I went to the pharmacy to have the presciption filled. I took the prescribed dosage daily with a big glass of water. I took my dosage in the evening.
1616	avage	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	wrinkles	fine lines around my eyes disappeared. the effect was gradual. It took about a year for them to completely disappear. Skin tone looks great too. People think I'm in my early thirties.	At first there is some redness and slight burning, but nothing I couldn't handle. Using it every other day was helpful. The redness and irritation go away after several weeks of use. I am very pleased with the results.	I use it every other day, mainly around the eyes and on the forehead. I've just begun using it on the neck, back of hands, and the rest of the face. I'll see how that goes!
1337	seroquel-xr	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	bipolar disorder	My treatment was good after I was hospitalized for deppression thay started me on Seroquel and I was getting better I started on it in oct 09	there was no side effects I took it at night	My mood changed a lot I went to in hospital therpay for 3mos they tried differnt drugs but seroquel changed alot it cost a lot $411 for 30 pills but it worth it
562	atenolol	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	extra heartbeat	The benefits are amazing.  I felt dizzy and like I was going to faint before I took the drug.  These symptoms went away and have stayed away for going on 20 years.  I also have seen that it helps with blood pressure and pulse rate.	I have never experienced any adverse side affects.	I simply take one tiny tablet each morning.
1888	doxycycline	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Treatment for three conditions all in one drug.	Stomach upset, sun sensitivity.	I'm unlucky to have three conditions that affect the attractiveness of my face.  I've struggled with acne since youth, and I've also had chronic blepharitis since age 12.  I am not heading into my 30's, and I'm beginning to develop rosacea on my upper cheeks, which could be contributing to my blepharitis.  Some days, I just don't feel like leaving the house because of how I look.  Doxycycline has helped clear up the acne and the rosacea symtoms.  However, it wasn't as affective at treating my blepharitis, so I'm not going to try a topical antibiotic, which has worked in the past.

3018	cipro	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	uti	i thought the uti cleared up but last night i began to feel symtpoms that it has returned.	Extremem fatigue, dizziness, feeling of emptiness, pain in all tendons which is worsening as the days go by. I have been off of cipro for four days and the pain woke me up in the middle of the night.  I have had a terrible headache and my temperature is either very hot or cold. (it is July)  I am unable to excercise for fear of rupturing a tendon.  My left achilles feels stiff andi am worried it is permanantly damaged.  I have never had tendonitis, but i am shocked that i could potentially be forever burdened with it.  My elbows, ankles, knees, hips and thighs, shoulders, neck ..all  of it in extreme pain.  Last night began the horrific nightmares.	"I went to urgent care because i was having severe kidney pain and i found blood in my urine.  The dr. too found blood and protien and suggested this drug.   I mentioned that i rarely take even and aspirin and am prone to side effects.  I also mentioned that a week earlier i had bloodwork done and it showed an inflamed liver.  I waited for the office to call me with the results which they never did.  Finally i called and they said they had lost my number, but yes indeed i did have a UTI.  (8 days later). I mentioned that i was having severe side effects and before i said what they were, they said, ""It doesn't sound related to the drug"".  It was an apprubt brush off.  Will these sypmtoms ever go away?  What is the time frame?"
3316	desonide	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	exzema of the face	the treatment benefits was that the skin irritation did go away for awhile. I thought that I had been cured of the skin rash. It cleared my skin up and gave me relief from the rash.	It turns out it did not cure it at all but possibly hurt my face.  It also may have made the condition spread to other areas of my face because in time I had other areas of my face where the rash was.  The cream was only a temporary relief to a deeper situation. If one is looking for fast relief it will help but it covers up an initial problem that needs to be addressed.	I saw a few dermatologists and each one told me to use it twice daily. I was even given different forms. One a cream and the other a foam.  I was also informed to use them for two weeks and then stop. I did, and when I stopped my rash slowly started coming back.
1695	retin-a-micro	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	to reduce/eliminate wrinkling	By using this treatment a minimum of every other day, I noted that the lines around the eyes (crows feet)were diminished greatly. Also, the skin tone feels tighter and my pores appear smaller. I have, at times, gone off of the cream for a few weeks at a time, particularly during the summmer when the Florida sun is at its most intense.	Initially, the skin has to get used to the treatment.  I experienced redness and moderate flaking in the first 2 weeks (at different intervals). However, the skin eventually becomes tolerant of the product.  There is still the periodic sloughing of dead skin cells; but that's okay because you'll have a fresh, healthy glow afterwards.	Retin A is a simple topical application to use.  I use it sparingly, minimum every other day, on my face and neck. I plan to continue using this product as part of my anti-aging regimine.
1174	prozac	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Manageability of depression.	Slight weight gain.	Take one pill daily until no longer needed.
3936	nexium	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	gerd	NO more food coming up my esophagas No more burning, no more waking up in the middle of the night with heartburn	mild bloating mild diarreha	Had helicobactor pylori with terrible acid reflux was treated with antibiotics and prilosec but still had terrible heartburn had a scope done and I had errosive esophagas started taking the nexium and has worked every since. If I miss a pill however my heartburn comes right back so I will have to stay on forever or eventually have surgery called a nissen fulondopation? wrap. I had all the testing for that surgery and was told I was a candidate fot it, so either I have to take the pill nexium forever or have surgery
2036	protonix	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	functional dyspepsia	I have/had an extremely easy to irritate stomach, over-sensitive to acid and food consumption. I spent most days feeling unbelievably bloated, even after only a few bites of food, sometimes. Protonix was prescribed to me in combination with Domperidone to reduce bloating, belching, and an acid-burning sensation in the stomach.	"None, really, that I can specifically blame on this drug. I had actually reacted fairly badly to other, similar drugs. The famous ""purple pill"" Nexium had actually given me a brutal headache, sore-throat, and even a racing heart-beat at times. I was somewhat anxious about taking another very similar medication, but Pantoprazole did not bother me at all (I have since read that Pantoprazole is one of the acid-reducers least likely to cause side-effects)."	"Treatment has been ongoing for several months and is set to continue. While still not quite ""normal"", I am feeling much better after several months of this therapy and will be discussing reducing my dosage and/or going off the drug completely in the next month or two."
1211	prozac	1	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	"My depression was significantly alleviated.  I would still feel bad somtimes, but it never again felt like true depresion.  It was like there was some ""padding"" between me and the bad feelings."	"There were actually no physical side effects, but I found that I said a lot of things I wouldn't normally say, and which I was embarassed about later.  Prozac made me feel like everything was fine, so I didn't take things seriously enough, and didn't take care of things which really needed to be taken care of.  I feel like I wasn't a good parent during that time, because my attitude was ""eh...who cares?...everything is fine"".  

I also had a very hard time withdrawing from it. I tried several times but fell into severe depression and had to start taking it again.  I thought I'd have to be on it for life.  However, once I managed to make it through a full week without it, I felt fine, and have never had to use it again."	I have a long history of depression but had never taken medication for it.  I asked my doctor to prescribe Prozac.  For the first week I felt the same, but I slept almost 24/7 and barely ate. After that I did get a significant relief from the depression.  Unfortunately, as I noted above, I don't like the way I acted during that time, and still cringe with embarassment and/or regret over things I said and did.  But at the time everything seemed so rosy, that none of my behavior bothered me.  Unfortunately, life is not perfect, and as adults we must take things seriously and deal with them.  Prozac kept me from acknowledging that.  Looking back, if I had faced my depression head on, and let it inspire me to make real changes in my life I would have been a lot better off in the long run.
2932	prednisolone	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bacterial infection in patient with copd	Rapidly eased the acute effects of the infection enabeling the patient to breath easier.  It also appeared to enhance the recovery rate from this prolonged infection.	"The patient was extreemly hungry on this medication and some weight gain was observed.  In this case, this was a positive side-effect as the patient was very underweight.

No other side-effects were noted however the treatment regime was difficlut for an elderly person to understand and needed the support of a family member to ensure that doses were not missed."	"40mg (8 tables of 5mg) taken for 5 days then 7 tablets taken for 3 days, 6 for 3 days, 5 for three days until taking one talbe for three days then stopping.

The importance of not missing or suddenly stopping this treatment was stressed by our doctor, as I beleive this can cause serious side-effects."

2048	prempro	3	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	menopause problems	this is an HRT product that was given in order to alleviate hot flashes and night sweats. The first two days there was no any effect, but after three days the hot flashes started to fade out and then eventually gone. At the same the problem with night sweats also was alleviated.	long-term bleeding	One tablet was used every evening with meals. After three days hot flashes were gone. On the 10th day vaginal bleeding started, which did not stop for 2 weeks until OC were used.
642	seasonique	6	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	Fewer periods, a big plus for any woman.	Spotting between periods (started off heavy like a period, but lightened up as time progressed), breast tenderness (do to fluid build-up),  breasts became larger in size (once more, do to fluid build-up), and bloating.	Although the beginning stages of taking the pill were somewhat uncomfortable, Seasonique has remained a staple in modern birth control.  I would suggest this medication to any woman that is tired of dealing with a period every month (which is the majority of us).  The only thing that you need to keep an eye on, besides taking the pill everyday, is when its time for your cycle ITS THERE!  Even though you're on the pill does not mean you still can't get pregnant.  Take tests every three weeks to ensure there are no surprises in store for you.
1077	effexor	5	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	After taking Effexor for several weeks, I felt decreased anxiety and generally more stability in my moods.  This anti depressant wasn't a miracle drug but I think it did help make things easier to handle and, in general, neutralized most life experiences.	I don't recall any severe side effects other than occasional tinnitus. The more severe side effects became apparent after I began attempting to discontinue use of the medication. At that time, although I withdrew from the dosage in very small amounts over a long period, the tinnitus was quite pronounced, especially after any sudden head movements.  I often felt dizzy for no reason.	I'm not sure exactly what information you are requesting here but treatment started with a relatively low dose, escalating to a higher one.  This was done in reverse when I decided to stop taking Effexor.  In retrospect, I'm not sure how much it helped me but had I known how difficult it would be to stop taking the medication, I probably would have asked my doctor for an alternative.
3028	seroquel	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sleeplessness and restless mind at night	Calmed racing mind (caused by stress and depression) and allowed a restful night's sleep.  Cleared the mind completely, did not dream at night, and did not wake during the night.	Difficulty waking up.  Grogginess during the entire morning. Inability to clearly focus throughout the day, due to the grogginess.  Increased frequency of migraines, in a person already subject to migraines.	Prescribed to be taken nightly as needed.  Originally prescribed 20 mg, increasing to 40 mg, and potentially increasing to 60 mg if needed for a 135 lb woman.  Intended to be taken for a few months, but due to grogginess and difficulty focusing, stopped using it after 3 weeks.
778	naproxen	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	nerve damage/ acdf surgery	Benefits of Naproxen helped with inflammation in the neck. Having a herniated disc the size of a plum impinged on a nerve for about a year and a half caused permanent nerve and muscle damage in the right arm. After surgery there was immediate relief however, because of the damage there are still issues with pain and inflammation. There are also still 2 bulging discs in the same area as the 2 herniated discs that were removed and replaced (i.e.) ACDF surgery.	At times there were stomach irritations as a result of Naproxen. It caused acid reflux to be moderate to severe at times. Taking with food helped and at other times it was necessary to take a medicine for the upset.	Treatment for inflammation in the cervical spine after ACDF surgery was necessary to remove 2 discs that were herniated and had a nerve severely impinged. As a result of nerve impingement there is permanent nerve damage and muscle damage. Almost 2 years after surgery still see doctor monthly for inflammation and pain. There are also 2 bulging discs that at this point and time have yet to cause any further surgery or pain.
324	ativan	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	Calm me down, helped me sleep, did not wake up a lot during the night, able to handle stressfull situations.  This has be great taking at this time in my life, my dad died three years ago, my brother passed in October of 09 and my mom just moved in with me.  I found that my antidepression pills were helping but sometime I just felt like I was going to jump out of my skin and take someone with me.  This just took the edge off of everything and made things much easier to handle.	tired, sleepy, dry mouth, sometimes diarreha, not much of an appetite.	Take 1 Tablet by mouth twice a day as needed for anxiety
2264	lexapro	4	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	depression reduced slightly	could no longer have  orgasms	I took lexapro for depression, within 2 weeks it affected my sex drive and within 4 weeks i was having difficulty reaching orgasm, whereas my entire life I never had this problem.  My depression was only minimally relieved.  I stopped taking it within 2 months, because I wanted my sex life back, and luckily it did come back.

WHEN BLOOD TESTS CONSISTENTLY RESULTED IN NORMAL THYROID LEVELS, STOPPED TAKING METHIMAZOLE ALTOGETHER. I'VE BEEN IN REMISSION NOW FOR 1 YR.
4028	tri-luma	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	melasma	no visible benefits	"Severly dry, flaky skin
redness and sensitivity in the area
burning and stinging

2696	detrol-la	1	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	frequent and urgent  urination	Gabapentin worked extremely well for my leg neuropathy.A combination of Zyrtec and Veramyst works quite well for my allergies. Requip takes care of my restless legs which at times had me getting up and having to walk to relieve the discomfort. Baclofen helps with my spasticity. After taking amitriptyline I am able to go to sleep in an hour or so. As for the Copaxone who knows? I have had only one flare up since starting it.	The Detrol was horrible. My mouth was so dry my tongue  literally stuck to the roof of my mouth making it difficult to speak. The Copaxone causes lumps and itching at the injection site.	When Zyrtec alone didn't controll my allergies my doctor prescribed the Veramyst to try. This combination seems to be working, Zyrtec once a day and Veramyst twice daily. The Baclofen 10mg.is taken as needed one to four times a day. Sometimes I'm not bothered with spasticity too often but when I am I take the Baclofen and it works.Amitriptyline tabs 25mg are taken before bedtime.Requip tabs .5mg are taken in the evening. Gabapentin 300mg is taken 3-4 times a day depending on the severity of pain. Tetracycline HCL 250mg is taken once a day. The Copaxone 200mg is injected once a day. I discontinued the Detrol LA as I could not tolerate the extreme dry mouth.
2972	niaspan	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high cholesteral	Niaspan helped reduce bad cholesterol and improve Triglycerides	occasional moderate to severe itching and flushing at night	"started dosage at 500MG worked up to 1500 but if I missed a dose i would drop back down to lower dosage to avoid flushing. I found it hard to stay at the 1500 range without severe flushing and itching and it would happen randomly no matter what even when i took aspirin and ate before taking.
Stopped for awhile and am now back on as my numbers have gone up again on bad Cholesterol and I do not want to take statins as I have no other makers yet for heart disease"
1600	xanax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	Xanax for me is particualy beneficial when either I need fast relief (one of the fastest acting benzodiazepines) or more in a social setting because it gives a more stimulating relaxation (i.e relaxes you but also enables you to be social compared to alternatives.)	The only thing to be aware of with this drug is that it is very short acting so while it may be perfect for situational anxiety (e.g a speech, social event, dentist etc) its not a good idea for people with more generalised anxiety as its short acting nature may mean that people get rebound anxiety and then feel the need to dose again (can lead to dependance.)	When taking as needed for particular events it works perfectly as a treatment
2673	prinivil	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	It lowered my blood pressure from borderline high (140/90) to normal (about 120/75).  This treatment worked most of the time.  THe only time it did not work as well was when I was ill or was having asthma related problems (difficulty breathing).  During those times, even with the lisinopril, my blood pressure went up to the pre-treatment level.	For over a year after starting the treatment I believe I had a side effect of a dry cough that was probably caused by this drug.  It was unclear whether or not it truly was caused by the lisinopril because the coughing did not stop when I temporarily halted treatment (for a few days).  When the coughing was at it's worst, my blood pressure went up, nullifying the effect of the linsinopril.	In spite of the irritating coughing, I continued taking the linsinopril and after numerous tests to rule out other causes of the coughing (one Dr. thought it was because of acid reflux), the coughing finally subsided.  After about a year of coughing, the coughing finally subsided and now (5-7 years later) I don't have any coughing whatsoever attributable to the lisinopril.
2459	nasacort-aq	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	sinusitis	Nasacort AQ has proven to be extremely effective in controlling my nasal stuffiness and sinusitis related to allergies.  Before use, it seemed my nose/sinuses were clogged on & off and made me much more susceptible to colds/flu--as much as 4 to 5 times per year & lasting 10 days to 2 weeks each round.  I was miserable.  Nasacort keeps my nasal passages open--it's a wonder!!	No side effects noticed.	1 to 2 sprays per nostril per day.  I tried to limit to 1 spray per side per day & found is just as effective.  This is on a regular, permanent basis to control allergies.
1931	zithromax	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	bronchitis	Cleared up illness as it has in the past. It is a very effective treatment for bronchitis and pneumonia. It has been much more effective than other antibiotics I have taken.	I did not experience any side effects. Again, I have taken this antibiotic before and had postive results.	Z-pack: I was prescribed 500 mg the first day and 250 mg for four days after that.
91	pristiq	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/anxiety	depression decreased while on this drug	I experienced minimal side effects, the only side effect was loss of appetite and weight loss which in my opinion isn't exactly a bad thing.  The other side effect that I experienced was loss of emotion, I was neither happy nor sad.  This is what made me stop taking the medication.  I switched to zoloft which worked just made me gain 18 lbs and now in the process in switching to something else.	see above
3171	prednisone	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	giant cell arteritis	Took care of the GCA -as long as I am taking it at least.	most significant: osteoporosis and skin thinning. muscle wasting. weight loss. possibly arterial side effects and TIREDNESS!	"The gca with eye involvement responded to the 60 mg prednisone immediately. the tapering of the prednisone proves to be the most difficult. After the first complete tapering ( down to zero ) a relapse occurred. Now on 6 mg maintencance. 
The side effects are somewhat held in check through rigorous vitamin and other orthomol. products, fishoil etc and exercise."
430	imitrex	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine headaches	Imitrex usually reduced the headache severity, if I was able to take it at the first sign of a headache. If I took it later, Imitrex might help somewhat but often not enough.	I was often tired after a severe headache. Otherwise, I didn't notice too many side effects.	I built up an immunity to the effects of Imitrex. I took them more often and needed to take more of them. I was eventually taking nearly 3 per day. It was extremely expensive, and the bigger issue is that such a high dosage isn't good long term. It was hell breaking the addiction!
2843	singulair	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	asthma	Singulair is very effective in keeping my asthmatic symptoms in control.  If I forget to take it, I can tell that my breathing becomes more labored by about 36 hours after the last dose.  I will on occasion (maybe 1-2 times per week) need to use my rescue inhaler (albuterol), but it is primarily needed to ease discomfort and not to stop a full blown asthma attack.  In fact, I have not suffered a full blown asthma attack since I started taking Singulair.	There are no apparent side effects of Singulair for me.	My asthma had become so bad that when I was to be administered a test where I would be exposed to irritants to guage the severity of my asthma, I did not even get past the saline control before my breathing was adversely affected.  I would say that my experience with Singulair has been superior (only surpassed  by Advair, which I had to stop using due to the fact that my insurance company wouldn't cover it anymore.  That led to my change to Singulair.)
3208	levothroid	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypothyroidism	The treatment benefits were really not noticable because the condition of hypothyroidism ranges from non-symptomatic to many symptoms.  At the time of diagnosis, I only had symptoms of mild fatigue which could have been the result of many other conditions	There were really no overt, obvious side effects of the treatment.  levothyroxine is known to cause insomnia.  It may have been coincidence, but my sleeping habits deteriorated approximately at the same time I began therapy.  I am currently in the process of reducing my dose to see if sleep habits improve, but lab values remain at good levels	As I mentioned above, my diagnosis was based almost exclusively on labratory tests.  TSH and T4 (thyroid hormone) were found to be too high and too low, respectively.  Relatively non-descript symptoms accompanied the list of complaints at the time of diagnosis.  These symptoms improved somewhat after treatment.  It is still to be determined if side effects will be improved on reduced dosage.
3960	prilosec	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	It completely eliminated all heartburn symptoms.  I am able to eat what I want whenever I want.  This is after nearly 2 years (before going on the drug) of trying to change my diet and lifestyle but no matter what I did, I could not find relief of constant, daily heartburn.  My days used to revolve around juggling over the counter heartburn medicines. This drug finally gave me relief.	No side effects.	"Unlike another user claims, this drug does not ""teach"" your body to produce more acid.  Once it's out of your system, it's out of your system, and yes the symptoms of acid reflux will likely return because this drug is not meant to cure any underlying condition, but simply to manage the painful symptoms of GERD and other problems with producing excess stomach acid.  I will probably have to take it forever, but it's worth it to me to take a medicine every day versus suffering every day with constant heartburn and acid reflux."

2117	renova	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	wrinkles	Some reduction in wrinkles and pores were observied, but I'm not sure if it's the Renova or the Fraxel or the combination.	Slight irritation at first with Renova. Fraxel treatments cause swelling and redness for a few days. Not too bad. But the Renova will sometimes cause skin to peel off and flake - looks bad but only lasts a day.	I'm doing Fraxel treatements once every 4-6 wks, combined with Renova every night (except right after the Fraxel treatment). Some improvement has been observed.

Also had arthritis pain in back and knee.  It is totally gone.  I am active and like to walk and do exercise and this has been a lifesaver.  Can really enjoy the workout without the pain.
3131	duragesic	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	cancer/constant pain	Having a constant level of pain relief by transdermal absorbpion.	After 6-16 hours I became quite sleepy and tired.

1652	vasotec	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypertension	i had elevated blood pressure which was treated with different medications in the past. initially i was treated with norvasc which caused constipation. then i was treated with cozaar which did not control blood pressure well , instead it caused fluctuation of the blood pressure going from high to low over the course of the day, which made me very uncomfortable because i will sense both high and low blood pressure and have headache whether it was low or high. vasotec even in the small dose that i am taking now   normalized  my blood pressure , so i do not have  fluctuation of the  blood pressure any more.	none	"medication is taken once daily for blood pressure control.
blood pressure is very well controlled. no side effects."
760	flonase	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	alergies	Not only was my nose cleared up almost immediately, my allergies weren't as harsh.  my Step father is a MD and he prescribes this to all of his patients.  I love this stuff.  The only bad part was that for the first minute or so after spraying it everything smelled very bad.	none	Two puffs in each nostril twice a day.
3577	differin	4	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	elarge pores blackheads around nose & cheeks	The Differin did seem to help clear up the occasional blemishes I would get. made a slight improvement in the size of blackheads on my nose and cheeks but didn't aleviate them entirely.	My skin became more sensitive although this happened after about a week of use not in the beginning. There were times when my skin felt warm. My skin peeled a little bit and felt and appeared dry. There was some periodic itching. My skin became more sensitive and something like a scrape would hurt. Additionally and most noticeably even though I avoided my eye area the differin would make the skin around my eyes sore, red and flaky. I'm not sure how it spread to my eyes when I avoided rubbing it in anywhere close, but it did.	I was directed to apply once or twice a week and build up to once per night as tolerated. I was able to tolerate once per night application for the entire course of treatment. There were some negative side effects (itching, sensitivity, warmth, and redness especially around my eyes) and not much in the way of positive side effects. I am now considering asking my dermatologist for a different prescription.
3639	retin-a	8	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Reduced acne.  I had mild/moderate acne, and Retin-A did decrease the amount of ance I had.  I liked Retin-A also because it reduces wrinkles.  I am only 28, so I don't have many wrinkles, but used it as prevention.	My skin would become too dry.  It seemed that even after months of usage, my ance would not completely disappear.  If I used more Retin-A, my acne would get better for a week or two until my skin became too dry and then I would have worse acne	I would apply Retin-A to my face once a day at night
1967	lyrica	9	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pinched nerves	Lyrica really helped my pinched nerves and radicuopathy in my legs. I would go to bed in terrible pain and sometimes couldn't even lie down because my lower back and legs would cause me so much discomfort. When I woke up I couldn't feel my legs and could barely walk. Lyrica makes it easy and painless to sleep and in the morning I can walk and drive without worrying if my legs will go numb.	After taking Lyrica I developed tinnitus. I started hearing Morse code, music, and running water. I was also checked for ear problems and schizophrenia and the tests were negative. It did cause some drowsiness and made it hard to get up in the morning for the fist two or three weeks, but overall it has been a blessing. No weight gain either, although my doctor did warn me it could happen.	Take as recommended by your doctor.
4124	chantix	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	quitting smoking	The only time I didn't want to smoke was when I was so nauseous and or throwing up after taking the medication. I seemingly derived no benefit from the use of this medication.	nausea, vommiting, depression, vivid dreams, and nightmares.  The vommiting came on within minutes of ingestion and my physician offered no other dosage or medication to alleviate the side effects.	I was to be on this course of treatment for a possible 12 weeks....From the onset of treatment, I experienced every one of the adverse effects and was told that after a few weeks they would subside...So was not the case in my situation...I finally gave up as my life was severely impacted by using this medication.
2189	clonazepam	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	sleep walking/talking	This drug is very effective in making me sleep well, and works as a paralytic on my brain to keep me from sleep walking/talking.  It has also cut down on my migraines since I started taking it.	Daytime drowsiness, highly addictive, bad withdrawal symptoms which caused terrible insomnia.	I took 1mg at night (up from an initial 1/2 mg dose) before bed as a treatment for sleep walking/talking and the inability to progress to deep sleep. This medicine worked great at first, but after 6 months I was no longer seeing a benefit.  The doctor took me off of it for 2 weeks as a drug holiday to let my brain rest, and had to put me on another med during that time because I had terrible insomnia as a result of withdrawal (I have never had insomnia in my life).  I do have some short term memory problems, but overall saw a bigger benefit to feeling better and an increased quality of life to stop taking the drug.

2739	actonel	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	post-menopausal osteopenia	My annual bone density scan improved significantly after my first year on Actonel.  Although I still have osteopenia, my physician says Actonel is helping to maintain this improvement and it is keep me from progressing to osteoporosis.	I have not had any side effects, not even the heartburn that is the most common one.	I take one 35 mg tab of Actonel first thing every Wednesday morning on an empty stomach with a full glass of water, sometimes 2 glasses.  I wait at least 30 minutes before I eat or drink anything.  While I am supposed to wait at least 30 minutes before lying down again, I confess that on a couple of Wednesday mornings when I was especially tired, I did lay back down.  Even then, however, I did not experience any heartburn.
151	zmax	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinus/ lung infection from a cold	The infection's symptoms of green mucus cleared up within 3 days.

Thick green mucus from the nose and coughing up green/ grey mucus, low grade fever. My doctor prescribed Azithromycin for the sinus/ lung infection.

By the 3rd day, nasal mucus was yellow and was coughing much less. By the 4th day I felt much better, nose still producing mucus and slight coughing, but no longer as much production of mucus.

546	propranolol	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	panic attacks	I felt less anxious when doing presentations.  I took it before I was ready to perform to prevent a panic attack.  I felt like it calmed me down	I didn't feel like I had any.  I felt the same before and after taking the drug.	"I was prescribed the medicine to decrease ""panic attack"" symptoms.  I am a very nervous person."
2761	risperdal-consta	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	psychotic symptoms	Psychotic thoughts went away.  No longer thought people were out to get me.  Became less suspicious of people.  Iritability decreaed while on this medication.  This medication has worked wonders for me.	None at all for me.  I have tolerated this medication very well.	Started this medication in October 2008 for my suspiciousness of people (thought people were out to get me).  Began at 0.25 mg once a day for a week, then increased to 0.5 mg a day at night.  3 weeks later (1 month from the time of starting risperidone), increased to 1 mg every night.  Stayed on 1 mg for a few months when the symptoms came back.  Dose increased to 1.5 mg a day.  Depression set in (for outside life factors...not due to medication) and fluoetime added at 10 mg a day and risperidone decreased to 1 mg a day due to flueoxetine increasing the levels of risperidone.  Depression still there and psychotic symptoms came back.  At next vist (1 month) flueoxetine increased to 20 mg every morning and risperidone increased back to 1.5 mg a day.  Two months later psychotic symptoms would come back in the middle of the day (as if the medication was wearing off).  Rispreridone dosage changed to 1 mg twice a day.  Which is still the current dosage I am on.
3354	lipitor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hyperlipidemia	LOWERED my cholesterol. This medication also lowered my LDL cholesterol while raising HDL	none	required nightly administration.

423	imitrex	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	Relieves a migraine 8 out of 10 times.	Strange tingling sensations, a 'floaty' feeling, occasional stomach ache	Sometimes it makes me feel really weird for awhile afterwards, but it is worth it to calm the pounding in my head. I've had migraines since kindergarten and only recently discovered Imitrex. I never knew there was actually a pill that would take away a migraine. I think they cause rebound headaches, and they're ridiculously expensive, but it's more than worth it in the moment.
3236	nuvaring	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	birth control/ regular periods.	I have been very happy to have a period on time every month. It gives me the reassurance that I'm not pregnant because usually my periods would be almost half a month to a month late. Also, I have yet to become pregnant, but I still use additional protection at all times.	None. I don't understand how it could bring about side effects really. It doesn't cause weight gain. If you gain weight on this, it's your own fault for eating too much! =] The only thing I can think of is when I go to the bathroom it comes out a bit, but nothing that can't be fixed immediately. Never come completely out yet without me physically removing it.	Simple. I would 100% recommend this.
663	erythromycin	2	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	bladder infection	none. I only took the prescription for 1 day	My entire body broke out in a red, itchy rash that was not relieved by scratching nor by topical agents. I reported the reaction to the pharmacist and to my doctor, both of whom told me to cease using the antibiotic immediately as continued use in the presence of the adverse reaction could be very dangerous.	The erythromicin was changed to amoxycillin, which I used safely and effectively for 5 to seven days and experience complete relief from symptoms of the bladder infection for which I was being treated.
801	ambien	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	sleep	to get restful sleep	sleepiness, drowiness, etc	"swallow the pill with water before bed. I was also using ambient because I was waking up in the middle of the nights and couldn�t fall asleep again. I got this drug prescribed for 10 days only. He told me I shouldn�t be taking it longer. 

I hear that ambient is addictive. Six years do sound too long. 
I am on Seroquel now. It treats both my depression and sleeping problems. You can also get it only by prescription."
759	flonase	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	running nose	Less running nose.It worked as soon as you used it. Working much better than the OTC saline nasal spray I tried. No side effects noted so far.	none noted yet.	Got the nasal spray for running nose, probably due to allergy or cold weather. It has worked pretty well. Much better than OTC nasal apray.
2020	protonix	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	peptic ulcer	The benefits of taking Protonix 20 mg is that my ulcer cleared up, and I was able to resume eating what I call normal foods.  I changed and stopped eating pizza, meat balls or extremely spicy foods, but if possible I will take a Tums before just to reduce any chance of problems.	I don't believe I had any side effects.  I know Protonix just like Nexium can be an addictive medicine simply because it work so well.  Some people seem to have minor side effects, but I am in great health and in good shape and I did not seem to have any side effects from using Protonix.	I was prescribed Protonix 20 mg which I took daily for 30 days.  Extended use is not recommended, and I did not surpass the 30 days.  I do buy extra strength Tums and take it if I have any real acid or spicy foods.  The bottom line is I had a lot of pain with my ucler which came out of nowhere and after almost 2 weeks of pain I decided I needed to see a doctor.  Soon after taking Protonix my pain went away, but as with any ulcer a diet change might be in order.  Similar drugs are Nexium, Prevacid, Prilosec, etc.
99	celebrex	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	inflamation resulting from damage to knee during s	reduced inflammation, swelling and pain on the in-side of left knee area	Headache, dull pain around side of head and to the rear. Numbing to one half of right arm from elbow to finger tips. did not affect thumb or digit next to, just the other three fingers.	"My doctor prescribed celebrex to treat an injury i sustained while playing tennis. i damaged soft tissue ligaments/muscle tissue to the in-side of the knee, which became heavily swollen, painful and inflamed.
I was prescribed this drug as I am allergic to Ibuprofen based pain killers.

Initially I experienced slight tingling and intermittent dull ache to areas around the side, uppersides and rear of the cranium.
It felt like pulsing which lasted about 2 seconds before fading away. and continued the cycle ranging from 1 minute to 20 minutes in duration at different times of the day. this occured a day into starting treatment.
This gradually faded away within a week but came back weeks after stopping treatment. eventually subsided after a month or so."
2509	motrin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	menstrual cramps	I was relieved of menstrual cramps within 15 minutes of taking the pill and during nighttime i was able to sleep peacefully without any pain.I was able to carry out my routine work	There are absolutely no side effects	it is advisable to take the tablet after breakfast and after dinner so that makes it twice a day but only for 4 days
1882	doxycycline	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bronchitis	I didn't feel that it was beneficial but the cough and yellow phelgm production lead me believe my bronchitis was bacterial therefore i had my doctor prescribe an antibiotic.  the one would not have been my choice for a respiratory issue.	I took the first dose without food liek the direction said and about 20 minutes later i was vomiting.	I was to take 2 tablets the first day and then one a day for 6 days.  after the fifth day my congestion/phlegm was clear so i stopped the medication.  i continued to have the irritating bronchitis wheezey cough.  so now i'm not sure the antibiotic really helped.
2058	prempro	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	unusual periods	"I started to take Prempro, the lowest dose, at age 56, because I would have freak periods - every six months.  I never really went through menopause.  No hot flashes, no night sweats.  But just a period out of the blue.  My doctor put me on 1 pill/day, .3, 1.5, and then I started to decrease the dose slowly to 1/2 pill per day, then 1/3 pill/day, then 1/4 pill/day.  Now I take one pill/week.  I find that the Prempro keeps my skin smooth and prevents incontinence, which started to happen when I tried to quit the drug entirely.
I still take it, but I do have water retention, even with this small dose."	Water retention, breast enlargement (not a bad thing).	See benefits.
2176	zyrtec	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	atopic eczema	The drug was very effective in counteracting severe itching caused by atopic eczema. Zyrtec was more effective than other similar drugs (Zodac, Zaditen) which I took before for the same condition. It did not have the effect of treating the actual cause of the symptoms (eczema) but it was very effective in treating symptoms, which was what I expected (I took other topical drugs for the eczema which did not ease the itching sensation).	I felt slightly tired after taking Zyrtec. However, this was not severe and I always took it in the evening because the information leaflet did mention that the drug can have these side effects. I was also always slightly more tired in the following morning (about 8-9 hrs after taking the drug) than typically.	This is a non-prescription drug and I took it because I was experiencing severe itching caused by eczema. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I only took it about 4 times when the itching was very bad, and it did alleviate it. I always took 1 pill a day.
2909	tramadol	5	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	fibromyalgia pain	In order to get any effects, I had to take 4-5 times the prescribed dosage.  The medication is simply VERY WEAK.  This drug did prove to me that managing pain on a daily basis, rather than responding to pain, significantly improved my quality of life and activity level.	"I did not experience any side effects on a normal or high dose.  A VERY HIGH dose (only taken accidentally, because I forgot I had taken my usual dose earlier) on an empty stomach, will produce an unpleasant ""high"" feeling mentally, including spaciness and shakiness.  Therefore you can't just keep taking more and more of the drug."	Bottom line, this drug just isn't very effective.  It's more effective, and SIGNIFICANTLY SAFER, than the NSAIDS that docs are still prescribing for fibromylagia.  But I am looking for better daily pain management.
539	trazodone	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	chronic severe insomnia	This medication was the only thing that was able to put me to sleep regularly after over 20 years of chronic insomnia!	There were no side effects.	I usually took 150 mg. per night.  Occasionally it would have trouble falling asleep again, and then I would increase the dose to 200 mg. for a few days.  I would then go back to 150 mg. once I got back into a regular sleeping pattern.  Although Trazodone is a mild anti-depressant, I did not notice any difference in my mood.
1712	retin-a-micro	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	At first, the acne on my face just went away. It's best for when you use it only once in a while.	I got my prescription for Retin-A Micro refilled about 2 months ago because it worked so well that I ran out of it! Now when I get acne and I apply the cream before bed, I wake up and there's no difference. The acne's still as big and as red as before. My skin must've gotten used to it or something, because it doesn't get rid of my acne.	I apply it before bed each night and the acne's still the same. It worked great at first, but now I don't use it anymore.
2913	tramadol	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	low back pain due to car accident	did not take my pain away fully but it took the edge off things and helped me throught the day to do some activities i usually could not do without the drug.	side effects were mild upset stomach, insomnia if taken before bed, boosted my mood,and social life.	"before tramadol i used  hydrocodone (vicodin) which is a narcotic pain killer ..it was was very effective with my pain but had a terrible come down ,i was very irritable and was just mad at things that with a sober mind i would not be mad at. tramadol has little come down and has a more natural ""high"" it boost your mood , with little euphria unlike narcotic pain killers. it feels as if someone just put the nicest , softest, warm blanket over you
tramadol  makes me alot more social, it boosts my mood and makes me just want to talk to people as normaly i would not want to associate with people as much.i recomend this drug to all. it is alot better for you than narcotic pain killers"
2235	allegra	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	seasonal allergies	It greatly reduced the effects I get from seasonal allergies including sneezing, stuffy or runny nose, itchy, watery eyes, and an itchy upper soft palate at the back/roof of my mouth.  It takes care of most of it, but I still get some itchiness at roof of my mouth.	No side effects!	I take one pill in the morning, and one at night.
2148	zyrtec	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hives, itching, swelling due to allergies	No allergic reactions while taking daily doses of Zyrtec and no side effects at all.	None	My son had been having terrible problems with allergies.  The cause is still unknown.  Constant hives, itching and worst of all his lips & eyes would swell excessively to the point where he couldn't leave the house.  He was prescribed Zyrtec 5 years ago and the only time he has a reaction is when he forgets to take his daily dose.  It has been wonderful.  Absolutely no side effects.
2613	adderall-xr	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	adhd	The medication helped the patient focus on daily activities and think more clearly. It also eased the patient's nervous 'fidgeting'.	The patient experienced some side-effects, including dry-mouth/increased thirst, dry skin and increased mild acne, and some mild sexual side-effects. The patient has attempted to combat all side-effects with increased water consumption.	"The patient was diagnosed with ADHD after describing a pattern of focus, memory and affect regulation problems she had experienced consistently since early childhood. The patient was given an initial prescription for Adderall XR in a 20 mg/day dose. The patient experienced an immediate improvement in her condition, which lasted for nearly three months. At three months, the patient described a waning of the positive effects of the medication but e reticence to increase the dosage without first pursuing other modes of treatment. 

After six months of treatment the patient, who had also begun behavioral counseling, agreed to increase her dosage to 30 mg/day. She has reported some increase in treatment side-effects but is generally pleased with the medication's positive effects."
709	accutane	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	I had tried every single thing to help my acne yet nothing worked. Then my doctor prescribed me Accutane and it seriously has been a miracle. Within a month my skin was almost completely clear. It felt so good to not wake up in the morning with a huge pimple on my forehead. This treatment has completely changed my life.	None - I took accutane and it changed my life for the better...I've had none of these side effects that are sometimes reported. My nephew and best friend also took accutane and couldn't be any happier with the results...I'm not depressed, I don't have joint pains or headaches or whatever else is being reported...	"I started with a low dose, then increased the dose after several weeks. The length of the treatment course was 6 months.

3485	diazepam	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	muscle relaxant - spinal disorder	Reduced muscular tension allowing for easier stretching and greatly reduced chronic pain caused by cervical disc issues	only down side was it made waking up in the morning slightly harder if I took a dose too late in the evening and might make me fall asleep early if taken too soon.	To reduce pain generated by nerve irritation due to cervical radiculopathy, I take 2mg to 4mg up to twice during the day, and up to 6mg in the evening.  Doeses are as required for muscle relaxation and used mostly for tension before evening stretching or massage.  Treatment has been going on for a year now with no ill effects.  I only use the drug when I feel it necessary, and have to date used less than 20% of the available doses
1039	vyvanse	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	adhd	Increased focus, attention, productivity. Better able to pay attention and absorb information in class. Reduced impulsivity. Increased motivation, increased mood. Lasts much longer than other ADHD drugs with much less severe side effects.	Restless legs at night, insomnia, headache (sometimes pretty bad). Also, make sure you take it and THEN START PRODUCTIVE THINGS, otherwise you attention will be focused on whatever you are doing when it starts to work, i.e. playing online games for hours.	I took adderall once as a child, and it made me so miserable that I never wanted to take it again. Concerta did nothing for me either, and as an adult, vyvanse was the first ADHD drug I was put on since I was in elementary school. I've been on 50 mg, 70 mg, and 60 mg. 60 works best for me, lasting about 7 hours. 70 mg kept me from being able to fall asleep and 50 mg only lasted about 5.5-6 hours. I am able to pay attention and absorb the information in my classes. I also found that vyvanse put me in a good mood for the day!
3281	zoloft	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression	Emotions were somewhat blunted. Less moodiness.	Weight gain, extreme tiredness during the day, insomnia at night, bad effect on libido and sexual ability. Extreme lethargy.	"I was on Zoloft for about 2 years total. I am extremely sensitive to medication, so I started at a dose of 25 mgs. and slowly titrated up to 100 mgs. I was unaware that this was probably too high of a dose for me. It subsequently caused me to start taking other prescriptions to mitigate some side effects. My doctor prescribed Ritalin and Focalin for the lethargy and fatigue side effects that I experienced during the day, and Ambien for the insomnia that Zoloft caused. I am still on Ambien to this day. 

The worst effect of Zoloft came when I tried to get off of it. It was total, utter hell. I have since found out that this is euphemistically called, ""discontinuation Syndrome."" 

I first cut the dose down to 50 mgs. and did not experience problems. I then slowly titrated down over several months until I came off of it completely. Over the next few weeks, I started experiencing strange, tingling sensations down my body, panic attacks, (which I had never experienced before), and extreme nausea - which became so bad, I lost 20 pounds in 6 weeks. This was all extremely traumatic as I am a type 1 diabetic who needs to eat to balance the insulin I take. The panic attacks got so bad, I had to be on Xanax XR everyday for months. I could not function normally or work. I tried to stick it out because I didn't want to go back on an SSRI after all the trouble and side effects it caused. I went to a MD who was also an alternative care specialist, thinking he could give me St. Johns Wort and I could manage with that until I got over the physical side effects of the SSRI, but it didn't work. I eventually had to go back on an SSRI just to function normally. I am on Lexapro now. I managed to be drug free for the first 40 years of my life (except for insulin), and now because of the aftermath of Zoloft, I am on Ambien, Lexapro, and Valium occasionally for anxiety. To top that off, the alternative doctor put me on a supplement that ended up being an anabolic steroid (which he called a 'nutritional supplement' and I ended up having to go on even more medication to fight the side effects that I incurred from that. All because of Zoloft. I will regret taking it the rest of my life."
1664	climara	2	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	total hysterctomy	---	Constant issues with the patch not staying on.  I called the manufacture (Bayer), they took down the lot number and said we are sorry.  They said they were going to send a new box to my local pharmacy at no charge.  I have checked every week for the last three weeks and NOTHING!  Yeah, great way to follow through.  Throughout being on the patch I noticed large acne on my face, lack of energy, no libido, vaginal dryness, daily hot flashes and extreme moodiness (so sorry to my husband, even though he has been great through all of this).  I know it has only been three months and my body is trying to adjust, but I just could not take it anymore.  I contacted my GYN and he prescribed Estratest.  Cross your fingers I hope it works!!!!	---
2621	trileptal	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	epilepsy	Controlled complex partial seizures.	Dizziness, fatigue, nausea	Started at 2 doses of 300 mg a day and worked up to 4 doses per day over a six month period. Only at 1200 mg a day did the drug control the seizures. During each time when I increased the dosage, I founf the side-effects worsened, but after a week or so, the side effects minimized and then disappeared.
2748	micardis	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high blood pressure	The drug Micardis did seem to alleviate my high blood pressure to some degree though definitely not entirely.  My blood pressure is still higher than I or my doctor would like it to be. At the moment it averages about 140 over 90 but it was 180 over 110. Therefore I would say it was somewhat efficacious. It also alleviated some headaches that I assume were blood pressure related.	I find when I am taking Micardis that I tend to be very tired and my libido is decreased.	I take Micardis in pill form once daily.
