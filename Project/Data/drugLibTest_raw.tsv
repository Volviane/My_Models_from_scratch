1366	biaxin	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinus infection	The antibiotic may have destroyed bacteria causing my sinus infection.  But it may also have been caused by a virus, so its hard to say.	Some back pain, some nauseau.	Took the antibiotics for 14 days. Sinus infection was gone after the 6th day.
3724	lamictal	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar disorder	"Lamictal stabilized my serious mood swings. One minute I was clawing up the walls in pure mania, the next curled up in a fetal position on my bed contemplating suicdie. I am no longer at the whim of my moods and neither are those around me. I'm lucky that I started pharmaceuticals almost immediately after I was diagnosed a bipolar. Lamictal gives me amazing clarity to go about my day, honestly assess myself and form real relationships. Lamitcal lifted a fog, I guess you could call it. Now that I'm medicated I realize how cloudy my thought processes used to be. It's a wonderful feeling.

Interestingly, I hardly dreamt before beginning Lamictal. I would dream (I mean dream in the sense of being able to imagine pictures and scenes while asleep, not REM) maybe once every two months. Now I dream every night. I found that the closer I take it to bedtime the more frequent and more intense my dreams."	"Drowsiness, a bit of mental numbness. If you take too much, you will feel sedated. Since you have to be able to clearly and honestly assess your emotions and thoughts, determining how much medication you need is tough. I found that 400mg works perfectly for me, but that's a high dose. Less than that and I can feel the medicine wearing off prematurely (I like it to last 24hrs, from sleep to sleep). More than that and I feel numb. Some might call it drowsiness, but it's more a sluggishness of the mind for me.

Before I began treating my bipolar disorder, I used to write a fair amount of fiction. It sort of flowed from me. I definitely had the artist's temperament. After Lamictal, though, that inherent creativity fizzled out. It doesn't come spilling out of me while I'm deep into a manic euphoria. I have to work at art now. It's something that requires discipline. If you are in a field which requires creativity, expect to see a change in your output."	Severe mood swings between hypomania and depression with suicide ideation before Lamictal. Began with 10mg and tritrated up to 400mg over a few months. Played around with the dosage to finally arrive at 400mg. Experimented with taking it at different times in the evening. Found that most comfortable time is before sleep.
3824	depakene	4	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar disorder	Initial benefits were comparable to the brand name version of this drug, Depakote.  I had been taking Depakote for several months and experienced great results.  When I went to my psychiatrist for an evaluation and re-fill, he accidently prescribed the generic version, Depakene.  When I discovered the error, I was told by this doctor that I would experience the same results as Depakote.  The positive side effects of the Depakene: balanced mood, improved concentration, improved logical cognition, mental clarity, lessened anxiety and irritability, improved sleep, increase in pleasure about activities	Depakene has a very thin coating, which caused severe heart burn and stomach upset.  The discomfort was so unpleasant that it made me not want to take my meds, so I was not taking them consistently as prescribed.  This caused my mood to fluctuate again.  Even after I switched to the Depakote, my stomach was still uncomfortable for several weeks afterwards.  My appetite decreased and food was very unappetizing.  Certain foods that I normally enjoy, such as chicken or fish, made me feel extremely queasy when I ate them.  I did not like the physical side effect of the drug, and decided to quit my psychiatric drugs altogether - because I was no longer stable anymore!	"Depakote was prescribed to me by a Kaiser psychiatrist in Pleasant Hill, CA in 2006.  The medication was given to help treat the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, Type II.  My disease was misdiagnosed for several years as depression, since I was never seen by a professional during hypomanic episodes, and when I did see a professional, I did not think that my manic symptoms were signs of a serious psychiatric problem.  Anti-depressant drugs were prescribed: Prozac in 2001, which had minimal effect and I stopped taking them a few months later. Wellbutrin was prescribed again for ""chronic depression"" in the spring of 2006, but this medication slowly spun me into an intense manic period.  After the manic episode, I fell very hard into a severe, suicidal depressive state.  I was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric ward in June 2006 to keep me safe and to properly diagnose my condition.  The symptoms I was experiencing before being prescribed the Depakote/Depakene: rapidly cycling mood swings between intense activation and irritablity/excitement and crashing lows and depression, suicidal thoughts, poor logic and decision making, racing thoughts, anxiety, poor concentration, and poor sleep."
969	sarafem	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	bi-polar / anxiety	It controlls my mood swings. It helps me think before i act or speak. It controlls amxiety. IT FREED ME TO LIVE MY LIFE HAPPILY!!! I cared about my life more. Everything had more meaning to me. I lived a very dull life before taking prozac.	I didnt really notice any side effects.	This drug may not be for everyone but its wonderful for me! It makes me a totally different person, a better person.
696	accutane	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	nodular acne	Within one week of treatment superficial acne lesions were visibly reduced.  Sebum production which had been excessive before beginning was significantly reduced (after course of treatment level increased to a more normal level).  After one month of treatment no new acne lesions occured.  By the end of treatment no new acne developed, and old lesions had healed.	"Side effects included moderate to severe dry skin.  This condition was rectified by the topical application of ""Aquafore"" moisturizer."	Drug was taken in gelatin tablet at 0.5 mg per day.  Drug treatment was carried out with bi-monthly visits to physician.  After 25 weeks ended treatment successfully finished treatment.  No recurrence of acne.
1380	biaxin	2	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	sinus infection	By the end of the 10-day treatment I felt better, but still had major congestion, green/yellow mucus and was coughing up mucus.  The symptoms were milder than before I started the treatment but definitely not gone.	I felt no significant side effects - perhaps some slight drowsiness.	Basically the treatment did not seem to work.  My presumption is that symptoms should have completely cleared up by the end of the 10-day treatment, but they were still significantly present.

1939	ultram-er	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	cervical disk degeneration and lower back pain	Ive been taking Tramadol for 2 weeks now. Ive been taking vicodin and percocuet for 7 months due to Cervial disk degeneration and lower back pain. I have to admit I loved taking Vicodin and percocuet. The problem is that they would knock me out. Tramadol has been awesome. It takes 90% of the pain away and I feel like I actually have energy again. From reading previous comments it sounds like I take a lower dose. Im really happy about that cause if I get use to it then I can up my dose and not feel worried about it.	I have had no side effects so far. I hope it stays that way.	Treating for neck, shoulder, arms, lower back, hip, thigh and knee pain.
2576	klonopin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	panic disorder	"I immediately stopped having panic attacks.  It really was miraculous, as they were becoming more and more frequent and severe.  On the combination of klonopin and prozac, I have not experienced a panic attack in 10 years. I simply feel ""normal"", and am able to go through my days without any feelings of extreme nausea or dizziness, which is how my panic attacks manifested themselves.  No longer did I have to leave work early, avoid restaurants and supermarkets, or worry about getting suddenly ""sick"", for no reason."	I experienced no side effects.  I was not tired nor did I feel medicated.	I started both klonopin and prozac together.  At first, I took klonopin 4 times a day.  Then gradually I was able to cut back to twice a day, first thing in the morning and again at dinnertime.  I did this very gradually, cutting out first the noontime dosage, and then the bedtime one.  I have never had talk-therapy at all.  I continue to take klonopin, or the generic clonazapam to this day with no adverse reactions at all.
1093	effexor	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression	the presumed benefits were to help with a severe depression. in the beginning there was some benefit, ie less suicidal, apathetic, morbid, depressed. but the effects were short lived and dose had to be continually increased. the biggest benefit was probably placebo - feeling like i was getting help, hopeful and trusting in the treatment and doctors.	here we go.the initial effect would be dry mouth and sleepiness, not being able to think straight or function really but once the dose would be acclimatised it would be okay. but it also cased both hypo and hypersomnia. shakiness at times. large cognitive deficits in reading and comprehension (eyes would literally\ physically play tricks not seeing words or substituting others, blind spots)and a general confusion not knowing what i was doing where i was going.nightmares, nightsweats	family doctor initially prescribed wellbutin but a psychologist at the hospital suggested effexor. the dose would be increased as i would adjust and experience setbacks. the gabapentin was added when i had sleep troubles and to augment. many things were also added and subtracted to no avail. a psychiatrist felt the dose could be increased to 375 mg. so it was but i was not under any supervised care other than my family physician. all the above side effects caused me to be sent from specialist to specialist who all had tentative diagnoses ranging from borderline personality, narcolepsy (the modifinil), sleep apnea and restless leg, and finally bi polar. finally a different psychiatrist said it was the drugs!
1962	lyrica	3	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	fibromyalgia	some pain relief recieved minimized pain when touched	signigicant swelling of hands and feet so significant and uncomfortable that I had to discontinue the medication regimine	I started on 50mg twice aday with out any pain relief.  The dosage was increased to 100mg twice a day with some pain relief but the side effects began
142	valtrex	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	cold sores	Significantly diminished the symptoms and size of the cold sore.  Often, it would halt the development and the redness and swelling would disappear after a day or two, without the sore blistering/weeping/scabbing.  For my body, Valtrex has proven to be far more effective than either Famvir, or Zoviraz.   It is surprising how many people either do not treat cold sores, or are not aware of any new treatments after Zovirax.	Slight dizziness and tiredness, very minor.	2x 1000mg tablets every 12 hours for 1 day.
1269	provigil	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	chronic fatigue	Treatment benefits were noticeable but not substantial. I did not respond to 100mg a day as I or the doctor had hoped. But it did allow me to stay focused throughout the day with out drowsiness or fatigue, so I give it a positive review. Treatment effectiveness varies among individuals	nervousness, insomnia (if taken late in the day)	"Took 100mg each day in the morning, sometimes if drowsy another 100mg mid-day 
for cronic fatigue."
3499	maxalt	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine	"Very quick migraine relief with no nausea or drowsiness. Other medications (such as Imitrex and Relpax) had little to no effect, or took a minimum of 1 to 2 hours for relief to begin. 

I really like the dissolving tablet, as I can take it anytime without having to find a water fountain or other beverage. Relief is very quick, generally within 20 to 30 minutes."	"Very mild ""buzz."""	This is the first migraine medicine I've found to provide quick relief without unacceptable side effects of previous medications (nausea, severe drowsiness).
1598	xanax	5	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	The xanax would act as a downer. It would calm me temporaily but could throw me into depression depending on the situation. If the situation was mildly tramatic the xanax would calm me but then follow by depression. The following day I would have residual sedation. The main complain was the addiction. It was not exactly like a craving but if you did not take it your body would feel like something was missing. It did not hurt but until I took it again I felt not quite content and as soon as I would take the pill my body would feel like it would give a sigh of relief. I think it is as much addiction to the mind as to the body.	As I explained above. Addiction and drowsiness. Your mind and body felt like you were missing something. Until you took the pill you would be anxious but for no reason but as soon as you took the pill your mind would be relived. You would no longer dwell on the anxiety.	Once a day preferably at bedtime but if a situation arose I would have to take another sooner and still one at bedtime in order to sleep.
4095	chantix	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	stop smoking	The benefits were to eventually stop smoking.	At first I experienced a slight headache and upset stomache.	I was to take 1 small dosage pill twice a day for 1 week.  Then increase the pill to the regular dose gradually after that week.  The medication is suppose to stop you from wanting to smoke basically by making you sick to your stomache when you smoke. During the first week you can smoke, but the second week you have to stop.

Stomatitis to the point were eating and drinking became painful, used chloorhexidine mouthwash 1 minute 3 times daily, next to brushing (extremely painful mucosae and tongue). Lasted 10 days. Now disturbing and ugly proximal onychomyosis coming from a lateral onychomycosis on 20 % surface large toenail. My whole toenailplate is destroyed.

2150	zyrtec	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	seasonal allergies	This medicine stopped post nasal drip, itching throat, eyes, and nose.	There were no treatment side effects noted.	I have taken this medicine once daily, in the morning for at least 5 years.  It has been very helpful and does not make me sleepy.  It does not, however, last the 24 hours claimed, which is why I also take benadryl at night to manage allergy symptoms at night.
1544	methotrexate	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	psoraitic arthritis	the treatment masked the psoriasis and what was considered arthritis	increasing all over body pain	I started with 4 tabs and increased to 6 as the all over body pain increased and then they were going to put me on prednisone.  I opted to turn to homeopathic treatment and weaned off the methotrexate.  The all over body pain went completely away but the psoriasis was exacerbated.  I'd rather have that than not be able to walk or move.
3985	fosamax	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	bone loss	Helped build bone loss. Osteoporsis runs in my family. We are thin. Two of my sisters were diagnosed with osteoporsis in their early 40s. One sister fractured her pelvic bone at 40 from bone loss.	I had no side effects. I always followed the directions - take it with water. No other foods or drinks for an hour afterward. Don't ly down.	I took the drug weekly for about 8 years. During that time I have had 3 bone scans. My bone loss subsided. I also drink a lot of diet soda though, and that can effect calcium intake. In the last year I have increased exercising with weights. I am due for another bone scan in the fall.
1597	xanax	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	blood sugar controlled levels around 100-110, blood pressure had been normal ever since i was placed on these b/p medications.xanax was the only one that could prevent anxiety and panic attacks and help me sleep. as for fosamax, i have not had a follow up bone density so i do not know how beneficial it is for treating osteoporosis	since i started taking metformin my weight loss continued (this is unwanted weight loss). initially fosamax gave me severe flu like symptoms	metformin 250 mg od, benicar 5 mg od , fosamax 70mg q wk,norvasc 2.5 mg od
545	propranolol	5	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	rapid heart rate	I have suffered of rapid heart rate for sometime because of my thyroid problem. I was given this medicine to get my heart rate controlled. First few weeks the medicine did not seem to work for me but my doctor increased the dosage to 20mg twice a day, then that was the time I started to feel my heart rate slow down. The medicine is definitely effective but I guess the effect of it depends on the individual as it requres a certain dosage for it to work effectively.	I started feeling dizzy whenever I get up from sitting position to standing. I have informed my doctor about this and I was informed that this is a possible side effect of the drug.	Details as above.
1631	premarin	4	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	surgical memopause	The use of premarin reduced hot flashes and kept my skin looking younger. My skin doesn't look good since discontinuation of prenarin.	I experienced weight gain and sun sensitivity while taking premarin.	I took premarin once daily for over twenty five years following an emergency hysterectomy due to severe endometriosis. I stopped taking premarin because my doctor quit precsribing it.
298	lovenox	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	blood thinning/ circulation during pregnancy	Lovenox is given in subsequent pregnancies to women with recurrent miscarriage due to autoimmune issues.  Prior to taking Lovenox, I had two second trimester losses and thanks to Lovenox I was able to carry my two daughters to term.  It allowed my placenta to last the pregnancy without clotting and I was able to successfully have two children.	There are no major side effects.  There is an increased risk of bleeding but I did not experience this.  The only mild side effects was burning at the site of the injection when the medicine was going in, and some bruising at the site of the injection. Other than this I did not experience any sorts of side effects what so ever.	I had to self administer the shots twice a day.  Lovenox shots are primarily given on the belly.   However, the area usually remains sensitive and for anyone taking the drug for a prolonged period of time like I was, eventually you will run out of spots in your abdominal area and have to move to the thigh (I had to move to the thigh area during my last month of pregnancy). Other than slight burning and bruising, there was no other issues.  Initially I had a hard time giving myself the shot, and my husband had to do it, but once you get used to it, it's not really that bad and I was able to do it easily later on.  I was supposed to start the shots prior to conception and continue them six weeks postpartum.  My overall experience with Lovenox is very good and I am very happy that this drug was around to help me.
3690	effexor-xr	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	severe depression	i was severly depressed for weeks and would just cry all the time. i had tried several other anidepressants and none of them worked. one day my doctor said lets try a new drug called effexor xr. i was started on 75 mg for about 2 months and was still depressed so then i was increased to 150 mg and have been on it since. i an so much happier and my family is also. this medicine has been my life saver and recommend anyone depressed to take this one	i very vivid dreams but i can live with this side effect to be happy	i found that the treatment plan has made life worth living
1438	tirosint	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	slow thyroid  & irregular period	more energy and alertness, less fatigue & regular normal period duration. Periods had been irregular, and often very heavy with severe cramps and clotting. Mental attitude improved. I became less tired during the day and required fewer hours of sleep to feel fully rested. Concentration improved and thought process seems much more clear after taking the medicine for about four months.	none, I felt not ill effects	simply taking medication daily
2312	lexapro	3	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression/anxiety	Increased libido.	Vivid dreams, nightmares, diarrhea, increased anxiety, night sweats, exhaustion.	Began at 5 mg, increased to 10mg after a few weeks.  Have not been able to increase further because the side effects are so detrimental.  I am weaning myself off Lexapro now and beginning Celexa again.  I had a better experience on 20 mg of Celexa and it is far less expensive (because there is a generic).
2114	renova	5	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	wrinkles	The treatmeant benifits are that I showed a slight decrease in wrinkles. I really think that if used with other products it could be better. I also used sunscreen everyday. I really didn't see a difference in the sagging of the skin . I thought it would help with collagen production. I am continuing to use the product. I hope I see a difference.	The side effects are dry skin. I can't wax my eyebrows without having the skin peeled off. I know they say to stop 3 days before you wax but it doesn't help. Also, living in florida, my skin became very sensitive to the sunlight. I also get a slight tingling when I apply my sunblock or lotion.	I went to my doctor and asked for a wrinkle treatment. He give me some samples of the creame. He then wrote me out a year prescription of the creame. He told me to apply it twice a day but, if my skin becomes dry, to reduce it to one a day. I preceeded to do that and it stopped some of the dryness.
1481	cymbalta	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Initially prescribed 25mg Zoloft for depression , but after two weeks my condition was markedly worse. I realize that each of us have different tolerances to various substances, and after my GP changed the medication to 30mg daily of Cymbalta my condition started to improve, but relapsed after about 3 weeks. The assumption was that I had required the higher dose of 60mg daily, and since taking 60mg daily my condition has improved to be close to my normal happy self with interests in various things. My advice is to find the medication that 'agrees' with you and stick with it for at least 1 month.	Dry mouth. Constipation.	Chewing gum to relieve dry mouth. Eating at least 8 prunes daily for constipation
3202	omnicef	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	severe sore throat with pus, and ear pain on same	Sore throat considerably better	Constant nausea even with food, extremely cold, Extreme Dizziness, Hard to sleep, Severe shaking and weakness, fever, frequent need to urinate	I'm only on my second day and third dose, I'm taking this with 3 days, 2 times a day, 4 MG dose of Dexamethasone and I had a large shot of Rocephin
1349	crestor	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hypercholestremia	During first 12 months... lowered total cholesterol by 100 points, LDL by 90 points, and triglycerides by 74.11 months after starting medication, angina brought me to the ER. Cardiac catheterization was done and 60% blockage  found. 1 Year after that,more angina, another cath. and no change in blockage was found.	I did not experience any side effects and still continue that way. During the first year, my doctor was running labs every 3 months and at no time were any abnormalities noticed. He continues to do labs at 6 month intervals now and as of last one(3 weeks ago), still no problems noticed.	Began dose at 20 mg/day and have remained at that dose for 3.5 years. During that first year I also made some nutritional modifications. I recognize now that it was a half-hearted effort, but the combination still provided very good results.As of today, my cholesterol numbers have gotten even better. total CHOL.=102  TRI=49  LDL=55 and HDL=37(started @38).I had lapband surgery 3 months ago and have made dramatic changes in nutrition in addition to the medication.
777	naproxen	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	back spasm	Nothing	I woke up 3am and couldnt sleep I had the worst stomach pains thats in my stomach like gas pains and they hurt so bad. They come every 5 mins its the worst pain. For 2 days I have been in pain. I'd never take this medicine again. Im about to get up and throw it away now!	None
2991	strattera	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	bipolar	The treatment helped the patient focus on her daily tasks and enabled her to 'get going' in the morning.  In turn, the patient was able to exercise daily which also helped her maintain concentration throughout the day.  Daily exercise also helped her maintain her moods at a stable level.	At first the patient took the medication before she went to bed, which kept her awake at night and did not allow her to sleep.  After a couple of week with inadequate sleep, she sought help and the doctor prescribed her sleeping medication, Ativan.  It turned out that the poor sleep was due to taking the medication improperly.  When that was corrected, the patient was able to sleep again and was able to function at a high rate.	The patient is being treated for bipolar I disorder, with the most recent episode severe depression.   Being bipolar, she is not able to take anti-depressants as this may induce mania.  Therefore strattera is an effective alternative which enables the patient to function at a higher level thus treating some forms of depression.  Other drugs are taken in combination with strattera to help the patient function at an optimal level each day.
2050	prempro	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	pre-menepause	Blood pressure medicine lowered pressure and controled very well. starting bp was 140/100 to now at 115/65 or close to that. Thyroid medicine used after partial thyroidectomy due to benign cyst. Can't tell whether working on not. This is mostly based on acceptable blood levels.	Blood pressure medicine has a mild diaretic which causes frequent urination. Also some drowiness noticed so I take this at night before bed. Thyoid medicine really does not have any side affects for me. Tolerated well.	I take low dose of Prempro each day in the morning. No problems and tolerated well. At first had some breakthrough bleeding but that stopped after a couple of months. Positives outweighed. Mood improved, less vaginal dryness, skin cleared as well.
1933	zithromax	6	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	bronchitis infectiion	Infection cleared up but the cough did not. The Bronchitis returned and is still present. The Z pack was used on 2 seperate occasions but after the cough mucus was back to a clear color, my physician said I was fine. It is 3 weeks later and I still have Bronchitis and although my coughing is better it certainly is not gone.	The side effects were stomach cramps and diarrhea for 2 weeks. I also took yogurt but that did not seem to help much. The cramps came within 48 hours of the first dose. It was easy to take but as i cramped so much I am really wondering if I did not take the Z pack would I have been in the same place as I am now without the heavy antibiotics.	"My physician said that I should rest, keep the house at 65 ' and drink warm drinks. I was very sick with not being able to sleep, coughing as if my chest bones would crack open and without sleep the days were very difficult.

I was not able to function during the day as I was sleep deprived and felt very bad for a week."
3657	kapidex	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	reflux	stops persistent coughs in 30 days.	non	I tend to have persistent coughs after a cold, the coughs would last up to 8 months. I had been prescribed many cough medicine to treat the coughs, but nothing seen to work. This condition would occur winter after winter after a winter cold. Only two years ago my GI doctor diagnozed my condition as associated with reflux, and prescribed Kapidex for me to take at the onset of a cough. It works great because it stops my coughs after one month instead of up to 8 months.
2451	symbyax	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	bipolar disorder	The benefits were great. I really liked Symbyax because it didn't give me side effects like the other medication I used to take did. I would wake up in the day feeling refreshed. As I was taking Seroquil for my Schitzophrenia, I would always wake up feeling exhausted and tired;still, even though I would take the medicine during the nights! I used to be stressed and aggravated all the time before Symbyax and Seroquil. Now that I'm on Symbyax, I'm emotionally numb and the voices in my head vanished. So I had a good nights sleep and didn't wake up as tired as Seroquil used to make me. :]	I didn't really have many side effects besides the medicine making me want to go to sleep. But I'm not complaining, since it does help the voices and the shadows go away for a while. Besides that, my psychiatrist wanted me to take advantage of the other side effect, and that side effect is that Symbyax might make you gain a little weight. So I wouldn't suggest it to people who want to lose weight. I still didn't seen any change in the weight gain and it was about a month when I started taking the lowest dose of Symbyax. Now that that month is over, I just started taking a higher dosage and I have noticed an increase in my appetite. I recommend this drug for the depressed ones who are a little underweight and the Schitzophrenics.	As I was being diagnosed for my Bipolar disorder, I would say the medication did more for me than my therapist. The drug, Symbyax, made me more calm than I have ever been. It took about a week for the medicine to kick in and when it did, it really did work its magic even though Seroquil was pretty good at knocking me out to sleep, it didn't help me with my anxiety and depression like Symbyax has.
2616	adderall-xr	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	lack of attention for studying/school	Was able to study 6 hours in a row, pay attention in class rather than daydream, made me want to be perfect and learn everything.	"Loss of appetite, dry mouth, insomnia, OCD habits.
Last week, due to taking a class that was crammed into 2 weeks rather than 15 weeks, I took 9 adderall within a span of 5 days (mon-fri).  By Wednesday night, I had a lot of trouble breathing, I would take really deep quick breaths over and over.  This continued Thurs & Fri.  My heart beat was unstable by Thursday.

492	meridia	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	obesity	Dramatic loss of weight and inches first week.  Settled into Meridia's Program provided over the Internet (comes with perscription).  Promised myself to follow the rules.  The toughest for me, was not to weigh myself everyday.  Meridia wanted me to check only once a week and I'm glad I refrained.  The thrill of seeing a huge difference each week has kept my knees from complaining.  The strength of Meridia has never lessened.  If I forget to take it, I feel like the bottom of my floor has opened up and I am in free fall.  It really is strange...  When I take it with my vitamins each morning, it gives me a definite feeling of support.  I am loosing 2 lbs each week along with inches.  I'm doing better than what they advertise but that is probably because I have a gym in my home.  I walk 70 miles/mo. and do free weights.  I also love my whey protein porrage in the morning with blueberries, shake for lunch and balanced meal for dinner.  I do eat snacks.  A Starbucks coffee (also made at home), with 1/2 an energy bar... or, an orange.  Responsible eating.  I also understand the dynamics of over eating, being menopausal with depleated hormones.  Meridia has been a life saver for me.  Thanks to my fabulous Doctor, who is also using it.	In 2 mo. (3/4 of the program), 22 lbs weight loss.	3 months, 1 capsule of 10 mg. per day.  After 3 mo., back in to see my Doctor for another check-up.  Continuing on Meridia for another 3 months for achievement of goal.  According to my Doctor, I can use it as a maintenance.  I honestly have no side effects.  I just wish it wasn't so expensive.

3492	serzone	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	sleep distubance/mild depression	After just three weeks, I felt immensely better and began to enjoy the things that previously I had enjoyed--liked gardening and playing tennis. I also slept soundly. It lifted my mood dramatically, but never made me manic. I also felt more like being with people and noticed that I was no longer so preoccupied with myself or awkwardly self-consciousness. In short, I wasn't depressed and anxious anymore!	I gained about 5 lbs, which was not a problem for me since I'm slender to begin with. There was also some mild constipation, well not really constipation, but a decrease in the number of daily bowel movements. To offset that, I just drank more water. Not a big deal.	I used this drug after trying Wellbutrin, which made me too restless and hyper. It was proscribed by a psychiatrist, who was very well versed in pharmacology, for a depression that came about during menopause. I took it regularly for three years; it completely stopped negative thinking and enabled me to sleep deeply for the first time in several years. I had regular liver check-ups, but never had any decrease in correct liver functioning. After three years, I felt I was ready to cut back on the medication, which I did very, very gradually over the next year and a half so that there was no withdrawal period at all. I've been fine without it now for two years.

In order to correct Polycystic ovarian syndrom and to get pregnant I was given Progestin and clomid to resume ovulation. I would NEVER* take either of these synthetics again! I was a basketcase with mood swings, crying, depression etc.. and once I discontinued use I was able to return to a normal mental state. I used this for over 3 months while my poor family suffered, never recieving the results I hoped for. I achieved results only when I went natural and used a natural progetserone cream from AIM made with wild yam and instead of horrific side effects I had pleasant ones...my acne cleared, my insomnia got better and my overall mood was improved, 3 months later I was pregnant! I will always try herbal before synthetics from now on.
1867	augmentin	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sinus infection	All symptoms of sinus infection gone by third day.	From taking Augmentin before in the past, I knew that the way to avoid the nausea was to take it with food PLUS a large glass of orange juice. I forgot the first time, and was nauseous. Once I started taking the pill with orange juice, I was no longer nauseous. But I had diarrhea from the second day onwards, plus a yeast infections that I treated with myconazole and probiotics.

571	atenolol	7	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	supraventricular tachycardia	Lowered heart rate from 100bpm+ to 65-75bpm and held blood pressure at a near-perfect level. Episodes of extremely high heart rate (200bpm+) suddenly initiating and sustaining for several hours diminished in frequency from at least once every 1-2 weeks to three times over one year.	Previously on Metoprolol tartrate and later Metoprolol succinate (both varying doses) and experienced severe dizziness/light-headedness, heavy-chested, and shortness of breath. Also experienced severe exercise intolerance. These symptoms remain when switched to Atenolol, but at much less severe levels. On Atenolol, also experience short-term memory loss, vertigo, constipation, indigestion.	After diagnosed with tachycardia, prescribed metoprolol tartrate at varying doses over course of a few months (lowest dose possible was not high enough to keep heart rate low and next highest dose possible was too high, i.e, produced extreme shortness of breath/tight and heavy chest/dizziness. On the positive side, the medicine did slow heart rate and reduced episodes of extremely high heart rate. Next, prescribed metoprolol succinate with similar benefits and side effects. On both meds, side effects were too severe to function day to day. So I was put on Atenolol, and it has worked for me much better. Heart rate is held at a safe rate, and is more consistent than when on the metoprolol. Symptoms of dizziness, heavy chestedness, etc. are still present but highly diminished (I can at least perform normal daily functions now). Now I have additional symptoms of vertigo after elevator rides, indigestion, constipation, and short term memory loss (but nothing that I can't function with). Recently, doctors suggested a catheter ablation, as they discovered a source of my problems to be the presence of extra electrical pathways in my heart.
2056	prempro	4	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	menopause	Got rid of hot flashes but made other things much worse.	Depression, osteoporosis, vaginal dryness, and fatigue.	Daily pill. However, estrogen derived from mares is not bio-identical to humans and causes breast cancer. Also, progestin is only a synthetic version of progesterone, and we need progesterone for many, many things.

347	neurontin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	pain relief	After suffering a spinal cord injury in 1987 resulting in quadriplegia (C5/C6 complete), I experienced disassociated pain that was concentrated in my right thumb.  The problem got increasingly worse over the following years.  I ended up having to take a lot of ibuprofen and Vicodin, just to relieve the pain announce to allow me to get some work done.  However, the resulting side effects caused me to sleep a lot.  It also lead to depression.  I was finally given a prescription for gabapentin to try out.  It started working almost immediately.  After about two weeks I was rarely having the pain in my thumb anymore.  It doesn't cause me to get sleepy or feel drugged (like the Vicodin) so I have been able to work and concentrate on things once again.  It also seems to have helped with my depression, although that may have more to do with not having to deal with the pain, or the side effects of the pain relievers I was taking before.	I have noticed very little side effects at all.  I was told it may affect the effectiveness of other pain relievers, but so far I have not noticed that -- when I needed to take a Vicodin when my thumb did still hurt on occasion.  I have on rare occasions noticed some dizziness, although I am not sure I can attribute that to the drug (I have low blood pressure because of my spinal cord injury that can sometimes cause that to happen as well).	I take the medication three times a day as prescribed, drinking at least a cup of water with each dose.  I was originally taking a smaller dose of the gabapentin, but after about six months my thumb pain started to become more frequent again.  However, my doctor prescribe me a higher dose and that helped.  I do still have problems with the pain from time to time, but not at all like I used to.  All in all the drug has made a huge difference in my life thus far.

It helped in newly developing acne and cleared up the acne I already had.	While it helped my face, it consequently dried out the skin on my whole body as well.

Prednisone temporarily provided the client with mild relief, also calamine lotion was applied topically and seemed to provide some relief.

THe withdrawal rom only 10 mg took several months and required the substitution of wellbutrin on order to get through it.
I now take 150mg of wellbutrin which has a mood stabilizing effect, but not the feeling of ""well-being"" I had from prozac."
87	pristiq	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	The drug helped to lift me out of the worst part of the depression, but it's not a complete cure.

I suffered from impulsive behaviors, probably the most harmful/dangerous of them being binge-eating and bulimia.  Since taking Lamictal at 300mg for 4 months now my eating habits have become completely normal.  I have not purged in 3 months.  This is amazing.  I would binge eat and purge because of anxiety.  Now I feel like a normal person--not obsessed with food, I eat when I am hungry, stop when satiated.  I have lost a LOT of weight (20 pounds in 3 months without dieting/counting calories, etc.)...nothing was wrong with my metabolism, it was the impulsive eating, stealing food from others, throwing it up (which gave me a high--not just to get rid of the calories, but it calmed me...).  I love the Lamictal for this because it's not like some meds that make you lose weight by destroying the appetite.  I am just a normal person now!  

I also quit the Lexapro as it was triggering hypomanic episodes.  The Lamictal is stabilizing my moods--it doesn't numb the depression like the SSRIs I have been on.  I feel things.  I am clear-headed.  But I am able to step back and not be hurt by every look I get from people, I am not paranoid anymore, I can wake up in the morning with energy and I fall asleep within 3 minutes of hitting the pillow.  I get sleepy at 10pm.  I am not hyper and can sit still for more than 2 minutes.  :-)

All good for me.  This is the right medication for me..."	Loss of weight, but this was just a result of my mood stabilization as I had developed serious eating disorders.	"I started slowly and built up as recommended.  I have been very faithful and have not missed 1 dose in the 4 months on this medication.  I am now at 150mg 2x per day.  I think I will stop at this dosage as it is done its job on me...I don't need a higher dosage.  When I was at 200mg I was mostly ""fixed"", but still had rage issues and was still impulsive.

189	adderall	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	adult add	"Adderall greatly improved my focus and concentration.  Before my diagnosis of adult ADD, I had a very difficult time focusing and staying on task.  I also experienced ""hyper-focusing"", which prevented me from getting things done at work in a timely manner.  It has also helped improved my memory."	I didn't notice any side effects from Adderall.  However, it is metabolized very quickly and only stays effective for about 3 to 4 hours.  Forgetting to take the second dose around 1:00pm makes for a confusing afternoon, until I remember to take it.	My prescriber and I went through about 3 different medications before Adderall, and those did have unpleasant side effects such as sweaty palms (all the time), dizziness, and heart palpitations.  Once I found that Adderall didn't cause side effects for me, we gradually increased the dosage from 5 mg to 10mg and then back down to 7.5 mg which works best for me.
4003	celexa	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	panic disorder	"I had debilitating panic attacks and agoraphobia and Celexa completely saved me, allowed me to go live my life again. I even took a low dose and it still worked amazingly well, though it did take nearly a month to ""kick in."""	In the beginning I had nightmares and some nausea, but that all passed within a few weeks. When I stopped taking the medication, I did suffer some side effects.	I took 20/mg a day each day for some number of years.
378	lamotrigine	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar disorder	I felt better for the first few days, mood-wise.  But then I got depressed again.  So I guess that's not a benefit.	"I've always been one to freak out at the slightest appearance of illness - I have anxiety as well as bipolar disorder.  When I was told that lamotrigine (the first drug I've been on for bipolar) caused a potentially fatal rash, I decided that this time, I was going to try not to worry.  One out of ten people experience a rash on the drug - and I tried to be rational - that means I'm likely to be one of the nine that doesn't.

Oh, was I ever wrong.

Firstly, the lamotrigine didn't help with moods.  I wanted to die for two days more badly than I ever had in my life on this drug. It was excruciating.  Luckily, I have a lot of support, and I (obviously) didn't kill myself.

I couldn't sleep.  I lay awake most nights until 7am.  I eventually passed out and got maybe 4-6 hours of sleep.  This is barely better than the sleep I get when I'm hypomanic.  And we all know how bad it is when bipolar people don't sleep.  Luckily, the meds did seem to keep me from going upwards mood-wise.  I also had to pee ALL THE TIME, which was not fun.

That brings me to the rash.
I first noticed a few raised bumps on my inner forearms.  I thought it would go away, that I shouldn't freak out - I wasn't going to get the rash, right?  And the next morning, I was covered in a slightly raised, red rash, even on my face and hands.  I went to the clinic, and the doctor said I was having an allergic reaction.  He told me to just go home and stop taking the lamotrigine.  He knew nothing about it or the fact that it causes rashes.  It got worse, and by night-time I was freaked out.  I called a nurse and she told me to go to the emergency room.  I did, and they had me stay the night to make sure I didn't have Steven Johnson Syndrome.  Luckily, I don't.  I just have something called ""drug eruption.""

Even if it's not going to kill me, it's never fun being covered in red blotches.  I still am and it's been three days.  I'm afraid to go to the Starbucks around the corner.  My verdict?  Lamictal isn't worth it.  Don't risk it."	I was put on 12.5mg, then 25mg, and we were going to keep raising the dose slowly to minimize risk.
2988	strattera	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	adhd	Strattera helped my son slow down without making him groggy or taking away from his personality.	My son became a little whiney in the evening when the medication started to wear off.	I have always known that my son had ADHD, evan as a baby.  I started looking into medication last year.  My son was in 1st grade and had already been suspended from school 3 times.  He also was in the principals office at least 3 times a week.  He was not able to sit still or focus and was having trouble making friends because of his temper.  My husband was against medication, but I talked him into a non-stimulant. We tried Intuniv first, but, that dropped his blood pressure to a dangerous level. Then we found Strattera, our miracle drug.  Within a week we noticed a HUGE difference.  My sons outburst of rage had completely stopped.  This year he hasnt been to the principals office once and his grades are mostly A's with a few B's.  He has also become very popular this year and is invited to almost every Birthday party. I cant tell you how hard it is to see every child in the class invited to birthday parties except your son.  The best part is he is still himself.  The medication doesnt make him groggy or zombie like.  I dont know what we would have done without this drug.  The only side effect we noticed was that he would get a little more whiney than usual in the evening, when the medication was wearing off.  Other than that, we havent noticed any other side effects.  Thank you Strattera

326	ativan	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	insomnia	Drug was effective in helping the me the sleep I needed. Did its job flawlessly.	Aside from the usual drowsiness, I had a hangover feeling in the morning and as a result took the pill 2 hours before bed which resolved it. The warning label states sex drive may lessen, but with me it increased, quite dramtically actually. Usually one would consider increased sex drive a being good, but with me it was becomming disruptive to my life and the reason why I stopped taking it. I still give it high praise as it relieved my anxiety very effectively.	Do not want to disclose

I would sleep for nine or ten hours at night and still need a nap during the day. It also decreased my motivation to get things done.	I was diagnosed as having mild depression when I was 17. I was prescribed a mild dose (10mg) of celexa by my doctor. At the time, (being a teenager) I was frequently tired anyway. I think this is why I did not notice the side effect at first. But years later, I decided to try going off it, and discovered an increase in energy and motivation. After that, I tried a few other drugs like lexipro (which gave me the same side effects), and Wellbutrin (which made me feel manic, highly anxious and stressed). I had tried the Wellbutrin because I was told it would not make me sleepy. Unfortunately, in increased my anxiety to the extreme. Recently, I have gone to a therapist and with some therapy, I am no longer on any drugs. This is what I should have done in the first place.

In fact, it has completely eliminated flare ups for over 5 years. Before I started taking it, I would get a cold sore once or twice a year.

My doctor prescribed 400mg 3 times a day for 5 days. 
It is very important to begin treatment immediately. Hours can make a difference, once the blister has formed, its probably too late and you will have to go through the scabbing and healing process.

2193	clonazepam	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety/ panic attacks	I get very bad panic attacks and completely break down no matter where I am. I decided that I couldn't let it control my life anymore, so I talked to my doctor and he prescribed me clonazepam. This drug is very dependable and works fast. Whenever I feel anxiety coming on I will take 1 or 2 pills and I'm fine.	It makes me sleepy, but it's definitely worth it. I'd rather feel tired than have a panic attack	As needed

1145	ponstel	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	migraine	Although it did not completely rid me of my migraine it helped to dull the pain. I was actually able to go to work with a migraine instead to taking a day off to just lie still.	no side effects.	At the first symptoms of a migraine I wojld pop a copule of tablets. For severe migraines I would repeat the dosage about 8 hours later. However, over time I found the medication to be less effective and ultimately stopped taking it. It seems as though my body became immune to it's effectiveness.
1566	lortab	4	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	pain from recovering from abdominal surgery	treated pain due to an open wound from abdominal surgery	severe nausea, dizziness, lightheaded...I couldn't eat or drink many foods	taking pain medication while recovering from surgery...had an open wound with wound vac.  The pain was so severe, especially when it came time to change the dressings and clean out the wound in which case I would double up on the medication.

1135	methadone	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	opiate dependency	Achieved and maintained long term sobriety. No longer was exposed to the dangers of active asddiction. Began leading a healthy and productive lifestyle. Overall health improved. Mental health improved and stabilized.

2209	advair-diskus	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	asthma	Advair keeps my asthma completely in control if I am faithful to take the required dosage each day.  I have taken fluticasone before, but it seems to be the addition of salmeterol that is the key for keeping my asthma under control.	I have not experienced any treatment side effects.  I do have to rinse my mouth out after each dose to prevent oral yeast infection.	Each diskus has 60 chambers each containing a dose of medicine.  Dial to the next chamber, open it, put your mouth over the chamber hole and inhale.  I hold it in my lungs as long as I can then breathe out and rinse out my mouth.  The dosage counter lets you know how many doses remain.
4088	mobic	1	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	severe back pain	None yet	None...YET	After reading these reviews, I'm afraid of even starting this drug even with doctor's Rx. of t.5 mg daily.   Occasionally very effective but below average I think.   Why run tge risk of some of the horrible side effects, e.g. stomach surgery.  No thanks.  I'll take my prednisone!!
2631	depo-provera	4	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	preventing pregnancy	In one year, I only had two periods. My periods before Depo were 2-3 days and very light, on Depo they were longer and heavier. It is so convenient not having to remember to take a pill everyday at the same day. It was also 100% effective with preventing pregnancy for me.	The first side effect I noticed was my complete lack of sex drive. After this came the ridiculous mood swings that caused fights with my boyfriend over nothing. I would just cry for no reason at all and I felt like I was going insane. Breast tenderness was also becoming an annoyance because it would last for months. While these side effects were severe to me, the worst is the huge concave I now have in my thigh. While I had a total of four injections, only one caused a huge dimple. It's really embarassing and extremely noticable and I'm not sure why it happened. The doctor said it has happened to a few other patients including discoloration of the injection site. This is when I got off Depo and switched to Seasonique... Hopefully, this will work out better.	If you don't like receiving shots, this is definitely not the right method. It is a pretty large injection.  However, you only have to endure it four times a month and it's not painful.
3108	ortho-tri-cyclen	4	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control/control of menstrual cycle	The Ortho Tri-Cyclen provided effective birth control, and it also did cause my mentstrual cylcle to be more regular. My periods were less heavy, and I did not have such severe menstrual cramping each month while I was taking the pills. There are no other benefits to taking the pill that I am aware of.	I experienced migraine headaches several times per week where I could not do anything other than lay down with the lights off while on this medication. At first, I had no idea what was causing them, but my doctor informed me that my symptoms could be indicative of a more severe side effect, and she therefore advised me to stop taking them. They also caused some bloating and moodiness.	The Ortho Tri-Cyclen birth control pills are a low dosage progesterone treatment that is intended to prevent pregnancy. I was required to take one pill every day. My understanding is that I experienced a relatively rare side effect with the migraines. I have not heard any similar complaints from friends who were taking the same pill, other than complaints about weight gain, bloating and mild acne.
2175	zyrtec	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	allergies	almost 100% elimination of allergy symptoms	mild-moderate fatigue on awakening, brain fog till after lunch (at 10 mg dose)	Started on Zyrtec after Claritin was ineffective and Allegra caused arrhythmias.

Cut dose to 5 mg daily to reduce brain fog/fatigue issue - this works most of the time, ezcept on high mold spore or pollen days.
1783	citalopram	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression, anxiety	Decreased crying and depression.  Decreased anxiety.  Got rid of insomnia.	20mg - Mild nausea, stomach aches.  Dry mouth.  It made me very, very tired, so I take it before bed and sleep wonderfully. With 40mg dosage - increased sweating, faintness, nearly passing out.	I started with the 20mg dosage and it seemed to be working pretty well until about a month in when I had a bad anxiety attack.  After seeing the doctor, she upped me to 40mg.  After one dosage of 40mg, I nearly passed out twice and started profusely sweating.  My hearing also went all funny.  The doctor advised me to drop back down to 20mg and then try to go back up to the 40mg.  Emotionally, I felt better after the 40mg, even after nearly fainting, but the side effects were very bad.
641	seasonique	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control	I thought the benefits would be one period every 3 months, pregnancy prevention, regulated periods. I also read that they would be lighter and shorter and help with acne. WRONG!	Well I was quite leary about starting Seasonique, I was already taking Yaz and I loved it, but 4 periods a year why pass that up. From the moment I started taking it, it wasn't a decreased sex drive, I had none at all, which made the birth control completely useless to me. In addition to that, the acne just kept getting worse, I didn't have acne to begin with besides the occasional blemish here and there. It started getting worse on my face, then my chest, then my back, (it's not just one here or one there, my back, chest, and chin are seriously covered) I've even had one on my ribs! Crazy! My boobs no longer fit into my bras, even some shirts. It was like they doubled in size overnight (not a huge problem, just annoying with no explanation). I went out and bought a bra, a week later it didn't even cover my boobs. Lastly, I've been fretting the last 2 weeks because I still haven't gotten my period! I never had a problem with my periods showing up in the past, they've always been lighter and not very long, pretty ideal actually. The Dr. said I would bleed between... still not bleeding! I've taken 3 pregnancy tests, wasted 10 bucks on each! Oh yeah, I've been crying for no reason at all the last month. I started crying over some lady I didn't even know at work. I do not recommend taking Seasonique. I know it must be expensive although I don't know how much because my Dr. gave me sample packs and I'm not going to bother refilling it. Also they give you a coupon for $50 off and $25 off the next refill, if they are giving that much off it must be a lot. It wasn't terrible, just nothing was expected (and I still have no clue as to why I haven't gotten a period yet). I've tried several other birth control pills and never had any side effects with any of them. This is the first time I tried one where I only get a period every three months so maybe those are way different or something. If you are looking for a good pill, Yaz worked great for me and I never had any breakthrough bleeding, mood swings, loss of sex drive, acne or anything. Hope this helps.	1 pill every day for 12 weeks, then 1 week of period pills

After taking the medication for approximately three days the symptons began to subside and I was albe to function again. All told it took approximately one week before I could return to normal activities.	Increased appetite, blurred vision and mental confusion. I would eat a 1/2 gallon of ice cream each night while on this medicine.

3228	nuvaring	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	birth control	Birth control	None	I kept forgetting to take my daily birth control pill, so my doctor prescribed the Nuvaring. I put it in once, take it out in 3 to 4 weeks, and put a new one in a week later (after menstruation). I don't forget anymore and have no worries about an unwanted pregnancy.
3584	differin	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	I can't really say that the benefits were incredibly impressive. The topical treatment was used along side of an antibiotic for a series of weeks.(4-6) The acne condition improved, but never completely. Eventually, after a couple more scattered, severe breakouts in the following years; the acne went away.	The side effects were dry, tender, itchy skin. Lotion and Sunblock were very necessary.	One dime size topical application once every night before bed. This was alternated every other night with a topical retinol cream and combined with an antibiotic pill that was taken daily with a meal.
2265	lexapro	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	mild depression	The benefits were amazing.  After 3 days, I felt good.  I didnot want to stay home and not see anybody.	A little sleepiness at first.	I have always been depressed.  This flared up considerable when I was having trouble with endometrious.  I was just sick of myself.  Within a few days of taking Lexapro, I felt beeter and could make reliable decisions about things.  After my hysterectomy, I needed the meds to work with the HRT.  I just needed a little boost because my body was not responding to the hormone therapy like it should.

Very important to taper, no sudden stops or starts to this medication, adverse effects if you do.
3991	fosamax	4	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	osteoporosis	in theory, my bones should have gotten stronger, as measured by the bone scan done at my gynecologist office once every 18 months	I first tried the tablets and they would sit on my stomach as if I had a brick for breakfast. So I tried the oral solution which, in fact, was better on the stomach but,still, not completely without side effects. Most of the days I took Fosamax I had a slight stomach discomfort during the morning.	I took Fosamax for almost 4 years and after 2 bone density scans which showed no improvement  I decided to stop the treatment, against my doctor advice which was to take Fosamax for at least 5 years. I believe that we still do not know enough about how the bone keeps itself healthy and that bone scans are not yet reliable. It's a big business and I finally refused to keep a medication that is so hard on the digestive system and can also have very dangerous side effects (frozen bones, I believe it is called). I still have to be convinced that a low density bone is not necessarily stronger than a bone with more density. Waiting for more research I am trying to walk as much as possible and to follow a reasonable diet. And to be at peace with myself...  Thanks!
2777	clindamycin	2	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	post dental work	Initial signs of infection appeared to be treated effectively.	After a few days on this medication, it caused persistent diarrhea lasting several weeks.	Medication prescribed after root canal dental work to treat initial symptoms of infection. While infection did not occur, diarrhea was so persistent that I had to seek medical treatment. Will not take this again.
1976	lyrica	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	leg pain from compressed spinal cord	I was unable to go up and down steps without acute pain and unable to stand long or walk for too long without pain becoming unbearable.  I took my first dose of 100 mg  at bedtime and woke up in morning feeling almost like a new person.Tremendous reduction in pain and spasms of leg with greater range of motion.   After a day or two i had to increase the dosage as the knee started to stiffen up again making walking and steps difficult.	Side effects are sleeping very heavily and waking up beyond my usual time feeling a bit loopy. I am able to drive to work, but find it hard to verbalize during conversations and seem to be grasping for words at times, which is embarrassing in my field of work.i have also found myself to be quite unproductive at work,accomplishing anything seems to be a major chore.

1133	methadone	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	back pain	"Methadone certainly took care of the back pain I was experiencing. It was better than the other pain meds I tried (vicodin, oxycontin, percocet). The methadone doesn't make me drowsy nor does it give me ""buzz""."	The side effects is weight gain.  As it was explained to me, the methadone slows down your metabolism, hence the weight gain.	"I had scoliosis and also landed on my head in a dirt bike riding accident.I had back and neck surgery. I was fused in my last three vertebrae and had a 14"" rod implanted on the left side of my back and also one of the vertebrae in my neck was fused.

872	paxil	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	"Helped me to feel better.  Lessened anxiety, panic attacks, tension, emotional exhaustion.  I was able to tolerate being around people better because talking did not seem so loud. Once I was used to the drug, it helped me get out of bed and function in day to day life better (falling asleep & getting out of bed was a serious struggle).  Eventually with the combined therapy, I pretty much now feel like myself again, just with less energy reserve and ability to have discipline with my routine.  (For instance, I can't get up early, during the 5am, 6am hours and get to work on time like I use to.  In fact I'm late for everything now which is out of my character) Can' tolerate multiple loads of stress with calmness and collectivity like I use to.  Otherwise day to day life is manageble as long as I obey my bodies new limitations.
I didn't gain weight or increase in appetite.  I struggled with appetite actually and at times had to force myself to eat."	"This drug gave me alot of strange sensations.  When I turned my head left or right, I got this mild scratchy or whip like noise in my ears along with a tingling in my head; also my vision seemed to briefly black out.  This lasted for many months. I thought it was perhaps not real or just in my head. My psychiatrist called it ""tracking"" and confirmed it as a known side affect with paxil use.  I didn't bother to worry anymore about it.  This passed after some months.  I no longer get it.  I felt very dizzy and sleepy at times.  I'd fall asleep anywhere.  I don't know if it was the depression, the paxil, lack of sleep, my body trying to heal from stress.  Sometimes I felt like I was living life from inside of a fish bowl (from sensory standpoint). I was chronically late to my job of 8 years for 2 years straight after suffering this nervous breakdown (due to spousal abuse).  Subsequently, I was fired.
When I miss doses of the paxil, especially 2 or more in a row, I feel like I did when I just started them.  I can barely get out of bed and function.  I'm super sleepy.  I feel drunk.  I'm dizzy.  I will literally go missing for 2 days.  It takes a few days of regular doses to get me back into my normal mode."	Initially I was only prescriped paxil and xanax.  I took only these for a few months under my PMD.  Dose was increased from a lower one to 20mg as my depression and anxiety symptoms were still moderately severe, impairing my work performace and other quality of life.  Withing a few months I was referred to a psychiatrist for med mgmt. After less than 6 months, Wellbutrin was added to the cocktail at a dose of 150mg, then increased to 300mg XL once daily.  Ambien was also presccribed as my symptoms did not allow me to fall asleep.  Life greatly improved within the next 8 months to a year.  I weaned off the ambien and xanax completely.  Still take the paxil and wellbutrin at the same doses.  Also had counseling during all of this time.
3816	nolvadex	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	breast cancer	"The benefits of tamoxifen have been to be cancer free 2 years after my diagnosis. Hopefully this ""clean bill of health"" will continue as I begin year 3 of tamoxifen in my 5 year plan. The benefits of effexor help balance the mood swings caused by a lowered amount of estrogen in my body. Tamoxifen does its job by keeping the estrogen blocked in my body so any abnormal cells can't feed on the estrogen. My cancer was highly estrogen-positive. Lowered estrogen causes depression and mood swings. Effexor helps to alleviate these symptoms along with my exercise regime and healthy eating habits."	Side effects were more severe at the onset of taking tamoxifen. I had hot flashes that were quite severe. They often came without warning especially at mealtime. I also had some body aches and pains. Vaginal dryness was also severe. My period became erratic. After 2 years most side effects have decreased - hot flashes are gone as well as the aches. My period has been non-existant for 4 months. However, I feel irritable and edgy about the regularly scheduled time for a few days. The effexor helps. Dryness is still a problem but not as severe. Vaginal odor continues to be a concern.	I was put on Tamoxifen for 5 years following my 9/05 breast cancer diagnosis. I started Tamoxifen 12/05. I started Zoloft 2 months later when I began having mood swings. Zoloft helped for a year then I felt my symptoms returning. I began Effexor at 75 mg and have been fine. My oncologist felt I am young and strong (age 46, exercise 4 times weekly, runner, martial artist) and that I should try to lower or end my Effexor. However, I didn't agree. I needed help with the mood swings and irritability. I can't lose my temper at work. I work with developmentally disabled adults. Losing my temper could be my job. I did try a natural regime of vitamins (B-12 and E) for several months but I felt no relief. Friends even told me about my mood. I went from depressed to angry in a flash. The 75 mg of Effexor is wonderful. My estrogen is blocked by the Tamoxifen and the effexor helps keep me at an even keel.
2225	allegra	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	seasonal allergies	I had terrible itching, watery eyes, and sneezing from seasonal allergies.  This medication did not completely elimiate my symptoms, but is reduced them to a tolerable level without making me too tired or doped up to function at work.	I think I did experience some drowsiness from the medication, but nothing that was overly so such that I could not function at work.	The doseage was one pill/day
2596	buspar	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	I lived in a constant state of panic (shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, flushed feeling), and this medication completely erased all these symptoms.  I can now think clearly and make rational decisions.  I chose to stay on this very low dose and take an Ativan on the rare occasion a panic attack breaks through.	I feel a little drowsy and slightly lightheaded for about 30 minutes after taking medicine, but it is not severe enough to interfere with my work or life.	I take half a 10 mg tablet in the morning and the other half in the late afternoon.
3170	prednisone	2	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	polymyalgia rheumatica (pmr)	A slight reduction in pain. I am diabetic and was warned that it would raise my blood sugars, but it significantly reduced the night sugars.	Extreme shortness of breath (exhausted just walking from bedroom into bathroom and adding an inhaler did not significantly improve the condition, dizziness, chest pressure, water retention, confusion. The night sugars dipped dangerously low so I discontinued my night injection of Lantus. I have lost my independence with the use of this drug and become homebound.	After the diagnosis of PMR, I was instructed to take 10 mg. in the morning. Although the pain diminished, it was still high so dosage was increased to 15 mg. I repeatedly advise the rheumatolist of the breathing problems to no avail. The family doctor suggested dropping the dosage to 7 1/2 mg. per day, but the pain became extreme again so I went back to the initial dose of 10 m.g. The rheumatolist has suggested that I will be on prednisone for a year.

398	relpax	5	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine headaches	The medication took almost thirty minutes to kick in.

I also noticed my hands were very shaky after the medication was in my system for at least an hour.
2116	renova	5	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	wrinkles	My skin was much smoother and the pore size seemed to shrink.  Wrinkles were dimininshed and age spots lightened.	I developed acne that continnued to worsen until I stopped using it.  I had peeling and redness around my chin and peeling on my forehead.	Each night I washied my face with a mild clanser and waited for 20 minutes as reccommended by the prescription instructions.  I then applied a pea size amount of the treatment to my entire face.  I stopped using all the other skin care products I had been using before such as astringents, & benzoil peroxide.  My skin became very dry and peeled off during the day. Ane I developed large bumps and shallow flat white pussy blemishes all over my face, particularly on my chin & forehead.  I could see, however, that without this the texture and pore size improving, and my wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes were noticably improving.  I discontinued use after 3 weeks and went back to using benzoil peroxide to try to calm down the acne.  After 2 weeks it is starting to get better, but my skin is rougher now and the winkles and lines around my eyes are back to the way they were before I started the treatment.

2569	klonopin	1	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety	None	Impossible to stop taking; had to do a Librium switch to get off this drug. The withdrawal is horrid, and there are tons of people suffering because of this.	I had post-partum anxiety/depression, and was misdiagnosed with Bipolar with a post-partum onset. The Klonopin was prescribed for anxiety; a long term anxiety reducer. I saw little to no benefit. I was later rediagnosed by another doctor who said I absolutely did not have Bipolar, and slowly took me off my meds (5 years ago), which I'd been taking for six years. All drugs were easy to get off slowly, with the exception of Klonopin, which was hideous. The only way to get this drug out of my system was to do a Klonopin/Librium switch...and the Librium was very easy to get off of, thank goodness!
4072	mobic	2	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	poss. rheumitoid arth. lupus, or fibromyalgia	At least I tested it to see if i had Rhemutoid arth. before going through extensive testing.(I still have tto have test, but the doctor felt this might let us know which path to follow)	It hurt my stomache. I followed the direction and took it with food. My symptoms of the muscle, joint pain, fatigue, etc. seemed to almost get worse.	Take two 7.5 tabs twice a day. Return to DR. in 2 1/2 weeks. If it works good we know if not we'll go from their.
1673	claritin	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	allergies	There were no benefits.	Absolutely none.	I bought a 24-count box and took two as recommended each day.  2 days later having felt nothing, I took 4 for 2 days.  Again 2 days later I still had not received any relief, so I took the entire box.  Absolutely nothing happened.  This was the name brand drug, not a generic.

2703	naltrexone	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	multiple sclerosis	It stopped my Multiple Sclerosis progression.  I still take it.  There are a lot of MS patients  who are using it now.  It really works and is a very safe inexpensive drug.	I dream a little more.	It is a FDA approved drug at 50 mg. for Drug dependent patients.  It has been used in the 3 to 4.5 mg doses for MS for about 10 years.  It has gained popularity in the past 5 years and is undergoing various double blind placebo testing at this time for MS, Crones Disease, Aids, and various other conditions.  It is extremely safe in the Lower doses such as 4.5 mg.  It is also called LDN, as an abbreviation for Low Dose Naltrexone.  Once I started taking it for a few days, my MS symptoms improved and according to my Neurologist, my progression has absolutely stopped.  I started taking it in 2000.
33	alprazolam	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	About 14 years ago I started hyperventilating for no apparent reason.  I would wake up in the morning and within an hour I felt like I had to struggle to breath.  This would continue all day, every day.  After 5 years, I was prescribed alprazolam (the generic Xanax).  It worked almost immediately.  I still have some days that are worse than others, but it has been a lifesaver for me.  I take one when I get up and then 2 or 3 times again during the day as needed.  It stops the hyperventilating totally for the most part.	The only side effect is a mild drowsiness.  I take a very small dose.  The highest I take at one time is .5 mg.	I take one .25 mg pill within 1 hour of waking up.  I usually take the second one around noon and another before going to bed.  If my condition is worse for whatever reason, then I might take another one during the day, or one .5 mg in the evening.  Sometimes if I'm busy and I miss taking a dose, and I feel myself beginning to hyperventilate, I'll then take one.  It works fast.
214	trental	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hiv	The Trental reduced my viral load, increased my sex drive from none to moderate and the side effects were just some stomach upset, which was fixed by reducing my dose to twice a day.	Mild nausea and mild dizziness that were dose related.	I wanted to see if the Trental would reduce my viral load and it did.
1502	metrogel	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	skin  texture changes due to rosacea	None	none	Metrogel was applied after cleansing, before applying moisturizer.  This was done twice a day, morning and evening.  There was no change in the 'bumps' that were on my face, and there was no change in the progression of others that were forming.  I religiously used this get for two years before stopping treatment.  Using Metrogel was a complete waste of time for me.
3671	effexor-xr	3	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"I do not feel there were any benefits from this treatment - only side effects.
Weaning off the the drug was extremely difficult."	Impotence, tremor	I was given Effexor to take once a day for depression. I did not derive much benefit. I received a lot of benefit from seeing a therapist and taking nutritional supplements.
1335	seroquel-xr	8	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	bipolar ii	"I was diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder in February of 2009. I found that my manic states led to very erratic and inconsistent behavior. I also found the depressive lows to be particularly difficult to manage.

In November 2009 I was prescribed SEROQUEL by a Urgent Care Physician. Immediately I found its calming effects to be extremely relieving to my mania. I did, however, find it difficult to maintain a functioning state due to its sedating effects. I then switched to SEROQUEL XR and found a much more successful experience. I was initially given 400mg SEROQUEL XR paired with 10mg LEXAPRO. While initially a good way to stop the mania, I found 400mg to be too much to function on. I decided to halve my SEROQUEL XR dose to 200mg continuing to take 10mg of LEXAPRO. This combo has been great and I am so much calmer and feel way more in control of my life. I do, however, find the sedating effects to be difficult upon awaking in the morning. I try to offset this by ensuring that I receive a full 8-10 hour rest after administering a dosage. I would highly recommend this combo to anyone that is having difficulty finding a mental balance between dark and light. This year of treatment has allowed me to find a calm that I have never quite experienced beforehand."	"I found that despite the great benefits mentally, the physical side effects are a fair trade. 

I was about 115 lbs when I started this drug 10 months ago. Today I way about 147lbs. That's definitely a 37 pound gain.

Additionally, I always prided myself on my enormous amount of energy. After taking this drug I am extremely lethargic in the hours after taking it (bedtime) and the morning hours."	I take 200mg of SEROQUEL XR and 10mg of LEXAPRO nightly.
1124	evista	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	loss of bone density	BONE DENSITY INCREASED.  I HAD A BONE SCAN AND SHOWED ON THE BORDER LINE OF OSTEOPEROSIS, (?)

2424	synthroid	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hashimoto's thyroiditis	Most importantly, my blood pressure went back down to normal when my heart rate rose to a more normal level. I was then taken off the topral and my blood pressure has remained at a good level. Additionally, my hair stopped falling out and wasn't as dry. Also, my skin improved. Before the medication, my skin was horribly dry and flaky. The changes did not take place overnight. I would say that it took about 3-4 months to see any improvement in my hair and skin.	I really experienced very few side effects, if any.  Initially, they started me off on a very low dosage because they just thought it was simply hypothyroidism but after a blood test, they realized that I has Hashimooto's thyroidities and moointored it more closely. At low dosages, there wasn't much improvement in my symptoms. I do have excessive sweating but they aren't sure if that is the synthroid or menopause and the doctors don't really seem concerned.	Initially I was being treated for high blood pressure and put on topral but they did a TSH test and realized that something was wrong with my thyroid. I was originally started off on a very low dosage ( 12.5 mcg/daily) and had to keep going back for blood work every month. Slowly they increased it until they did another test and found out that it was Hashimoto's thyroiditis. At that point, they increased the dosage to 75 mcg/daily and so far it has worked out but I do have to keep having the TSH levels checked.
533	trazodone	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia/poor sleep quality	"Could fairly quickly fall asleep, and usually stay alseep, with little ""sleep hangover"" problem that most other medications result in. I could function in the morning. My general health started improving (fewer flues and colds, headaches, stress and depression, and I had much, much less pain as I started getting regular sleep."	Some constipation, maybe dry mouth and eyes (not sure if there is a direct cause and effect, but definitely an overlap in timing). About three months ago I started waking up during the night (anywhere from 12:30 am to 3 am) without being able to go back to sleep. Have tried numerous other medications and they all had much, much worse side effects that trazodone.	I'm not sure what you mean by this, I take trazodone nightly, and have taken it for at least two years. My worst experience from other sleep medications came from ambien (well before my doctor had even heard of the side effects I was having, nor were they listed on the medication or mentioned in the news). I also take cymbalta in conjunction with trazadone, which also supposedly helps you sleep, but the cymbalta alone is not effective for sleep at all for me.
943	levaquin	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	bronchitis	Terrible!  There are much safer alternatives than this poison.  Most fluoroquinolones have been taken off the market.  Johnson and Johnson should be ashamed of themselves.  They have not warned doctors properly of the serious side effects eventhough the FDA has placed TWO BLACK BOX WARNINGS!	SEVERE shooting, burning pains in all four extremities.  Prolonged heart rhythms, hallucinations, nightmares, insomnia.  Weakness and pain in all four extremitities.  Was a healthy 25 year old PE teacher prior to this poison.  Now in a wheelchair.	IV 500 mg Levaquin with Solumedrol and Theophylline.  NEVER take these three drugs together!!!
3333	tetracycline	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	moderate persisting acne	The combination therapy worked well but after discontinuation of therapy the condition returned and was worse than previous time.	dry skin and occasional nausea	I cleanse and apply elocon twice daily to my face and take antibiotics twice a day for 3 months my face cleared but returned after discontinuation of therapy.  Now my dermatologist has restarted the antibiotics orally and added retinoid cream twice a day.
617	finacea	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne and red marks from acne	It really helps keep my acne at bay - keeps pores clear and reduces frequency of inflamed pimples, reduces red marks from acne breakouts.  It is less drying/irritating than most other acne topicals.	Slight itching for the first month or so.	I was already pretty clear from going to an esthetician at an acne clinic, but I was just looking for an additional boost to the results I already had.  I previously discovered that I could not use anything other than very mild OTC retinoids, as they tended to make my acne flare up.  Finacea did not do this.  The Finacea was a good addition to my skin care regimen and has decreased the frequency of inflamed pimples and the tiny pustules I sometimes get around my nose.  Now I use Finacea in the morning, and Vivant's Derm A Gel in the evening, along with 5% benzoyl peroxide on my more acne prone areas (chin and jawline).
2692	indocin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis	Indomethacin immediate reduced the very inflamed and painful swelling in first joint of my left forefinger, my first - and thanks to prompt treatment with this drug - my only attack of rhumatoid arthritis.  I didn't recognise this swelling as arthritis because it was my first attack, and I neglected to seek medical advice until the joint was extremely inflamed and swollen.  Since this attack, I've used the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen as needed to prevent further attacks.	I experienced no adverse side effects when using Indomethacin with food as directed, and was very pleased with the almost immediate reduction in pain and swelling.	My doctor prescribed one 25mg capsule 3 times a day with food, for one month, which I followed; this treatment was completely successful for me. Since this treatment, I've used the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen as needed to prevent further attacks.
895	paxil	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	severe depression	None - I only had extremely bad side effects, which cost me my job, my home and my car. I just don't have fifty words to describe no benefits - thank you. I still need twenty words - hmmm - how am I doing?  Now I need ten words - can I quit now? Ugh!	Now this I can describe: Lethargy - stared at the walls when awake, which wasn't often - most of the time I was passed out cold - even on Adderall; hideous nightmares - so horrible that I won't repeat them; constant sweating; incontinence; emotionally and physically numb; muscle twitches; rash on tongue.	"I don't know how to answer this question, except to say that I was prescribed Paxil 40 mg to be taken once a day because I couldn't stop crying over a grief issue.  It didn't work.  We switched to Wellbutrin, which was somewhat better and I took it for a year before stopping.  It's been seven years since I went off all drugs and I still have occasional withdrawal symptoms that I call ""brain shocks."" I don't recommend SSRIs to anyone for anything. Oh - and I'm still grieving... sigh..."
3964	prilosec	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	dyspepsia	acid reflux was controlled as long as the capsule was taken first thing in the morning, less effective if taken later.	Larger dose was initially prescibed, side effects were migranes and blurred vision. Neither of these had been experienced prior to taking this drug and when it was reduced to 20mg side effects were not completely eliminated but considerably reduced.	1 20mg capsule taken with water 1st thing in the morning.
2550	dexedrine	3	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	supposed adhd	With less Dexedrine and minimal Depekote, I was able to sleep deeply when I finally did fall asleep. I also remember extremely vivid dreams. The house was kept super clean and I was motivated to finish tasks.	Horrible feeling. My heart felt like it would explode. I had horrible tic like behavior. I picked at my skin until permanently damaged. I had horrible dry mouth and I had bad breath.	"My sister was diagnosed with ADHD and so was my brother (Both were much younger 11 and 7 years younger) Both suffered from learning disabilities. I drove my sister to an appointment and due to my family history I was asked to take a questionair. I was then told that while I was not learning disabled (A Student), I was hyper and did I want to try the above drugs. They said I would never know how bad off I was until I knew what it felt like to be normal. I was given two perscriptions and was told to start with one dose of the dexedrine in the am and to take the Depekote and dexedrine in the afternoon. If that didn't do it they would up my dexedrine. With in about two months I felt like jumping from my skin and decided that organization was not that worth it. My skin still shows the scarring from all the picking and squeezing but my tone is no longer ""death warmed over"".
PS the doctor that prescribed this to me was investigated, tried and convicted of over prescribing, drug dealing and improper relationships with patients. (I can't remember the exact charges but he did get about 16 years for dealing controlled substances and was turned in by two female patients who said that he took advantage of their situation and slept with them.)"

That is all, and it worked.
644	seasonique	2	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	prevent pregnancy/reduce frequency of migraines	Pregnancy was prevented.	I had my period (some spotting, but mostly consistent bleeding) for two out of the three months of my first pill pack.  I also fought off migraines for about three days of the last month (middle of the month).  I also had the worst acne I've had since I was a teenager.	I don't understand this question.
840	ritalin	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	adhd	marked improvement in behavior	weight loss, jittery feeling, insomnia, withdrawal, isolation	I began taking ritalin and zoloft almost three years ago to treat ADHD and depression.  I also began seeing a therapist once a week.  I saw improvement, but it was slow and graduate at first, particularly with the regard to the Zoloft.  I saw immediate improvement with the ritalin.  It changed my daily life.  It keeps me calm; i am able to focus better and for longer.   I am no longer seeing the therapist nor am i taking the zoloft and today i feel great.
1376	biaxin	3	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bronchitis	The antibiotic works	Constant, horrible bitter taste.	I was given Biaxin during a bout of the flu because the doctor thought I was at risk for a bacterial infection.  I'm allergic to penicillin, so I always have to take something else.  I had no problem the first day, but the second day I noticed a weird bitter taste that I couldn't get rid of.  The doctor told me to stop taking it for a day, and now I'm waiting for him to give me something else.

2826	wellbutrin	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	stop smoking/depression	So far it's only been 3 days.  Wellbutrin seems to give me a spike of energy which is nice.  Still have the craving for cigs so I'm continuing to smoke like I usually do.	Sometimes I lash out for no reason at all.  With Lexapro I remember having to wait a few weeks to get results, so I'm sure I'll wait.	Doc says to wait, that's the treatment.  I'm hoping like many this treatement will help me stop smoking and ease my depression.  You have to change your life and make yourself a better person, not just rely on drugs to cure you.  So, I'm working on the little things in life to change.
2378	femara	3	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	breast cancer	Aromatase inhibitor to reduce recurence of hormone-positive breast cancer- unknown effectiveness- no breast cancer 3 years after diagnosis	Joint pain, reduction of bone mass	The first drug I was prescribed after a mastectomy and chemotherapy was Tamoxifen, which I took for almost 1 year.  My oncologist said it increased bone mass, so she wanted to use that first to counteract the bone mass-decreasing side effect of the aromatase inhibitors.  Their protocol is to use Tamoxifen for 2 years, then switch to an aromatase inhibitor for 3 years. However, I had some uterine bleeding ( I am post-menopausal) so they switched to Femara early. Tamoxifen may cause an increase in uterine cancer, which my grandmother had. The most annoying side effect of Femara is the increase in joint pain.  NSAIDs and glucosamine help somewhat but have their own side effects.  That said, I am willing to continue Femara for the next 2 years to help prevent cancer reccurence.  I read in the literature (Medscape) that 51% of women do not complete their 5 yrs of either drug, and my guess is because of side effects. I take supplemental calcium also to slow the bone loss.
3633	retin-a	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Since using the Retin-A along with the Accutane, I have noticed a great improvement in the look of my skin.  There are less clogged pores and it definitely more smooth and even in skin tone.  Any fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished but it hasn't helped much with fine lines around my eyes.	It does cause the skin to flake and peel but this can be counteracted with a good moisturizer.  Also, my face gets red or flushed easily with the slightest irritant.  Lastly, not being able to stay in the sun is a downfall.	I use Retin-A 0.25% every evening along with 70 mg of Accutane a day.  I will have to continue the Retin-A for at least a year.
3556	vytorin	3	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high cholesterol	Vytorin was prescribed to me to lower my cholesterol. I did not take the product long enought to see a significant drop in my cholesterol levels as I discontinuted treatment.	I developed diarrea after taking the ver first dose. I took it for about a week with no decrease in this side effect. I stopped taking it for 2 days and noticed relief instantly. I then began taking it again and side effects returned.	Vytorin was prescribed by my doctor for me for my high cholesterol. I took it for about a month and did not like the side effects. From the day that I began taking Vytorin I had diarrea. At first I thought it was purely coincidental until I stopped taking it for a few days. The side effects vanished. I took it again and they returned. I told my doctor about this and they switched me to Pravastatin ( same dosage) and the same side effects occurred. I then stopped taking the prescription.
1456	cymbalta	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I switched from Zoloft because the Cymbalta wasn't supposed to effect libido negatively.  Having ended my marriage and gone through menopause I don't feel I can judge that aspect fairly.  However, I feel the Cymbalta is much more effective in keeping the dark cloud off my head, allowing me to be more positive toward life on a consistent basis.	Dry mouth.	I really notice when I miss just one dose; it takes 2 - 3 days to catch up, but then I become very aware of negative feelings and apathy.  I am careful to take the dose in the mornings so it doesn't affect my sleep, but have taken as late as 4pm and not had sleep issues.
2374	propecia	7	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hair loss	Slowed hair loss in front and top of scalp.  Regrew hair at the back of the scalp and on sides.  It doesn't appear that hair loss has ceased completely for MPB, but increased hair grow in another areas makes my head appear fuller	"Loss of limbido.  My case probably isn't a perfect control because I lost a high paying job, moved to another state, and moved in with my girlfriend when I began taking the medication.  Within 4 months, started a brand new job and encountered other new stressors.  

I can attribute some of the loss of libido to job related stress and moving in with my girlfriend of 5 years.  I would guess the effects on libido would be very minimal had my job and living situations remained constant.

I'm overall much happier having thicker hair than I would be with a consistent sex drive.  I am able to get more work done and focus more on important life goals than being constantly distracted with sex.  Instead of wanting sex 5 times per week, I only want it twice per month now.  Again, this is probably a plus"	"I started slowing losing hair when I was 23-24.  The hair loss was unnoticeable until I turned 27.  My receding hairline started to become very apparent at 27, especially in my part line.  I began taking propecia when I turned 28 and it appears to have regrown hair on the back and sides of my scalp and has slowed my receding hairline.  Unfortunately, it appears that I am still developing a minor bald spot in the middle of my scalp.  

Based on my current rate of hair loss, I'm guessing that I will maintain a healthy head of hair for the next 4-5 years.  At 35, I probably won't care how my hair looks because I'll be well out of the dating game.  

I don't think Propecia is a cure-all for my particular pattern of baldness, but I feel it would be highly effective for others.  Anyone who is experiencing baldness at the back of scalp would benefit greatly.  The receding hairline will probably continue, but at a much slower pace.  I may eventually go completely bald regardless, but I honestly feel I've saved 3-5 years of youthful appearance."
3074	emsam	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression	None	I became increasingly agitated and angry. After being on it for 2 months, I tried to commit suicide.	I had been taking Effexor, Welbutrin and Ritalin for over three years. The combination worked better then any other cocktail I'd taken.  I complaine3d to Doctor that I was feeling lethargic so he switched me to Emsam. After a month he increased the dose. I attempted suicide. Found a new doctor..  Now taking cymbalta and welbutrin. Which seem to be working OK but they ain't no miracle drug.

803	ambien	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia	Occasionally I have a difficult time falling asleep and sleeping through the night.  When I take this medicine I fall asleep within 15 or so minutes and am able to sleep 7 or 8 hours.  My sleep seems undisturbed and uneventful.  When I wake up in the morning I awake completely alert and energized.	I did not experience any treatment side effects.	"I have been taking this medication for occasional insomnia for over one year now.  
I will continue to take this medication to treat my insomnia for as long as my physician prescribes it for me."
3050	seroquel	5	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	insomnia	After suffering for years from insomnia and becoming addicted to Ambien, I was finally able to sleep and there was no worry about the side effects such as addiction.

3613	retin-a	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne, anti-aging	Gradual lessening in severity and frequency of comedonal acne. Gradual slight improvement in skin texture, ie. fine lines around eyes appear slightly reduced, skin tone appears more even and sun damage appears reduced.	Slight increase in skin sensitivity, with stinging and mild redness experienced only after washing, and occasional slight flaking around mouth and eye areas. Increased sensitivity to UV light, necessitating daily use of high PPD sunscreen.	I started applying a pea-sized amount of the Retin-A cream on every second night about one hour after washing. After two weeks, because there were no adverse effects for me I started using the cream nightly. With nightly usage I experienced very slight side-effects of sensitivity, slight redness after washing and occasional slight flaking. None of these effects were severe so I continued with nightly treatment. After approximately one month I experienced gradual lessening in severity and frequency of comedonic acne. Comedones still formed, but were less likely to become inflamed/infected. Slight reduction in surface oiliness noted. After about 10 weeks I noted a slight improvement in sundamage and skin texture. Overall I was very pleased with the efficacy of this product, but may in the future switch to the Retin-A gel to see if this results in a further reduction of comedones.
1375	biaxin	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	sinus infection, chest infection	Sinus and chest infections were much better after 7 days. No more sinus pain or runny nose, and was no longer coughing up mucus.	Terrible bitter taste in the mouth, some mild nausea, and a yeast infection.

3735	lamictal	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	bipolar ii	"I quit taking Lithium because it didn't seem to be helping anymore and I didn't like the way it made me feel.  After going off Lithium my Dr. took me off Ativan which set in major anxiety.  I started drinking to ease the anxiety, but the alcohol sent me into major Manic/Depressive moods.  While drinking I was extremely manic, and while sober I went into major depressive states.  I could barely leave my house while in a depressive anxious state.  I missed a lot of work and started working from home.  Getting out of bed seemed impossible, finally got on Lamictal which took about six weeks to fully kick in.  Since then my anxiety has gone down(lower than ever before).  I am on a low dose of Klonopin that is taken on an ""as needed basis.""  My life is has improved greatly since I have been on Lamictal, works much better than the Lithium ever did.  I am so greatful for this drug it has given me my life back."	None	Started out on 25mg/day and slowly worked my way up to 200/mg 2x's a day.  Saw a therapist once a week for about 8 weeks, then switched down to once every other week for a month.  Now my family Dr. is handling my prescription.  I am lucky about that because I was told that some Dr's do not feel comfortable handling bipolar drugs.

903	paxil	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	ocd	There were none at all.	There were many side effects such as mild hallucinations, major heart palpitations, and increased anxiety.	I took Paxil for 2 weeks and after experiencing the horrible side effects I decided to tell my doctor that I wanted to stop taking it. My first 2 - 3 days were fine, until the dose was increased.

538	trazodone	5	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia/ a bit of depression	They sometimes help me sleep throughout the night. Some nights when I feel really depressed, I feel like taking more.. but never do. Those were the nights that were really hard for me to fall asleep, even after taking the trazodone.	I've only been on trazodone for about a month now, but already I experience a bad taste in my mouth. Also when im just lying down and relaxing I get this sharpe pain in my right ribs as well as down my right side into my mid back. It only began when I started taking this medication.	..

Increased ability to attend to particular tasks without constantly moving towards another task. Ability to prioritize and to remember what original intentions were after beginning a task.	If next dose not taken in a timely manner, effects wear off very quickly and suddenly very tired. Small bubbling in head at times. If dosage even slightly too high, then noticable heart palpitations present along with increased heart rate. Active dreaming if taken late in the day.	It took a very long time to find the best medication and the best dosage. Over a year of trials. Medication is taken along with proper diet and increased physical activity. Omega 3 supplementation also added to routine. Important to note that nicotene is also taken regularly in the form of nicorette gum. All information above is based on the two together as complete treatment. Either on it's own is not enough.
3178	desyrel	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	It helped enormously with sleep and gave me quite vivid dreams upon occasion.  I felt more relaxed in general and overall, quite happy - in fact, slightly euphoric ( it is a mild antidepressant).  I was able to sleep at least eight hours and waking, I was alert and not sluggish.	I felt a little unmotivated during the aftgernoons.  Mornings, I was quite peppy but afternoon arrived and I felt sleepy, which is not normal for me.  I also had headaches upon waking up and  felt a bit unfocused.  But overall, it was great!	I started with 25 mg a night, taken right before I wanted to fall asleep.  This worked off and one but not always for my insomnia.  I increased the dosage to 50 mg, which was highly effective.  I took one 50 mg pill.  I felt sluggish in the morning ONLY when I took a pill in the middle of the night, say 3 or 4 in the morning when I couldn't sleep.
519	requip	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	restless leg syndrome	Treatments benefits was the relaxation of legs at bedtime so I could sleep.	The only side effect I have noticed has been a bit of drowsiness (but it IS bedtime).	Requip is taken 1-1/2 to 2 hours before bedtime.

Took several years to get Chronic Fatigue/Fibromyalgia diagnosis and quite awhile after that before this medicine was prescribed. Tried most of the standard ADD medications to help with brain fog but bad side effects, worked for awhile then stopped, or no effect. Many doctors not comfortable perscribing this medication for ADD or ADD-like symptoms since it's a weight-loss medicine. I usually only take this medication during the work week and give my body a break on teh weekends.
752	flonase	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	I had tried several allergy medicines, but had the side effects of extremely dry eyes - so dry that I blinked constantly and my eyes felt achy. Flonase has controlled my allergies fairly well without the dry eye side effects.  I still have drainage (which I have always had), but it isn't too bad and I don't get sinus infections or pain too often. I have been happy with it.	None.	I have recently started using a Netti-Pot in hopes of being able to stop using Flonase daily. I have not yet weened myself from Flonase.
3275	zoloft	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	The patient has been taking this in hopes of fighting the depression he is dealing with while going through cancer treatments. He has been taking this drug for one month now and has noticed markable improvements. He is able to concentrate better and focus better.

As said, this patient has been taking this in hopes of fighting depression he is dealing with while going through cancer treatments.
408	restasis	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	dry eye	After several months using these drops I really could not tell much benefit. However, when I stopped  using them for a month the dry eye problem was bad enough to make me realize they had been helping enough to make me realize I was better off with them than without. I continue to use them.	I had no side effects except some slight burning once in a while when I put them in my eye.	I was to put one drop in each eye in the morning and again in the evening.
2261	lexapro	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	It has worked pretty well at lifting my depression symptoms. Not dramatic effects but enough to help. It also decreased my appetite and I lost about 10 lbs and didn't gain it back.	I had mild nausea at first but that stopped.	I take one 10 mg tablet a day.
3893	dispermox	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	tooth abscess	The abscess cleared totally after taking the stated dose for 4 days.  The full 7 day course was however taken.	There were no noticeable side effects.	The doctor advised taking 2 tablets for the first dose to 'kick start' it into my system, which I did.  After 4 days of the treatment, the swelling and the pain had almost gone.  I was then able to attend a dentist who could examine and treat the tooth that caused the abscess.
987	antivert	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	b.p.p.v. (benign proxysmal positional vertigo)	It helped with the dizziness only because it made me so sleepy I couldn't stay up to notice the dizziness!	Sometimes it would make my heart race so fast I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. This happened about 1 out of ever 5 times I took it.	It had sedative effects so it just made me want to sleep. It wouldn't have been good for me at treating my dizzy spells while I was at work or in the middle of running errands because I would get much too tired to function safely.
481	meridia	6	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	weight loss	This drug initially provided a modest suppression of appetite. However, within one week my appetite was as great as ever. Given that this medication is not covered by insurance, its virtual ineffectiveness is particularly noteworthy.	none	Patient is supposed to take it first thing in the morning so that its time release qualites have the longest impact. One is told that after a month or so you may need to boost your dosage to continue to experience benefits. However, for me, the benefit lasted only 1 week! Not worth it!
528	trazodone	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	sleep disorder, insomnia	I was able to fall asleep and stay asleep.	I do not experience side effects IF I practice these other habits:  not drink any coffee after 10 am; I have to take the drug between 9:30 and 10:15 pm and go to sleep then.  If I take the drug after 10:30pm, I will be woozy and drugged the next day.  If I have to stay up later for any reason, then I can't take the drug and therefore will have insomnia and interrupted sleep.	Take 150 mg at bedtime and go to sleep immediately thereafter.
2955	zyban	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	smoking	After smoking for 41 years, I no longer smoke and can't believe I ever did.	ZERO side effects.	"I held on to the prescription for 18 months, but never filled it - until I decided I should, completely expecting to fail.  I did as prescribed and continued to smoke through the first week or so.  One night I saw only six cigarettes left. I became anxious and actually went out and BOUGHT TWO PACKS! Leaving the store, I felt like a junkie who just scored a fix, and, I was disgusted.  But - I smoked them, finishing the two packs in a bit over a week, which was much less smoking than I had ever done.  ..And,.. after smoking the last remaining cigarette, I magically never smoked again.  

It's been over a year and I can almost qualify as one who has no cravings because they are so, so rare (maybe once every four or five months) and they last for less than a nano-second. 

I'm so smoke free and amazed at two things: 1. How easy it was to stop because of the Zyban, and, 2. That I ever smoked at all - even though I did for 41 years. Other than being smart enough to finally get the prescription filled, I deserve no credit because there has been no need for any great will on my part. I have absolutely no cravings, no desires, no urges to have to will myself through.  They simply don't happen."
2307	lexapro	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/anxiety	Deppression disappeared. Anxiety disappeared. Since I have been on Lexapro I have realised I have been depressed most of my life. I have a very strong family history of major depression. I was in denial to the fact I was depressed. When you have always been depressed you don't know any different. Since Lexapro I have felt alot calmer and happier. The intense guilt I felt about everything has almost gone. My mind would also constantly relieve traumatic past events and mistakes I had made. I really didn't ever want to wake up in the morning - but now I do. The depressive need to sleep in the day time has gone. I am also becoming much less socially isolated, more confident and have began ejoying life. I would have liked to find Lexapro Many years ago.	"I started taking 5mg daily for the first two weeks and did feel an increase in anxiety which subsided after a couple of days. When I increased to 10 mg the anxiety returned and then again subsided. I also felt ""far away and fuzzzy headed"" for about 3 weeks. Insomnia was also an initial side effect. After 6 weeks I am not experiencing any side effects and am extremely grateful for my improved mood."	I began taking Lexapro for 6 weeks. I started at 5mg for two weeks and then increased it to 10mg. I plan to continue taking it for a long time as i have never felt better.
1518	glucophage	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	diabetes type 2	Lowering of blood sugar without risk of hypoglycemia	None	For years I took 4 ml glimepiride daily for type 2 diabetes, but often awoke in the middle of the night due to hypoglycemia.  Finally my doctor reduced my glimepiride to 2 ml daily and added 250 ml metformin daily.  For me, this combination is very effective.  It controls my blood sugar as well as the glimepiride alone without the concomitant hypoglycemia.  I understand that some people with borderline type 2 diabetes control their sugar levels with metformin alone, and my doctor may try this if my glycohemoglobin blood tests (HbA1C) stay in the low 6s.
687	accutane	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	The benefits were having clearer skin between month 2 and month 6.My skin did clear but i did still experience some smaller cystic breakouts, which was disappointing.	the side effects were minimal and consisted of dry, cracked lips. Aquafor did help alleviate that situation. My mood was mildly affected. I did experience some mood swings from time to time. The other downside was having to go do the monthly bloodwork. Not having insurance and a tight schedule at work made it a little inconvenient and certainly expensive.	Overall it was helpful but there is alot involved in being on the drug and the side effects are tolerable overall. I wish the benefits had a longer residual effect or there were some other long term treatments for cystic acne that were effective
2753	xenical	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	obesity	Lost 8 kg during 6 months, which would have been more if eating healthier and exercising.	Strong and first difficult to control bowel movements	This drug makes your body to reject about 30% of fats that you intake with your meals. But you still get the rest of it. What happens with 30% - it comes out and sometimes it is quite an embarrassing experience. Got to control it later, mainly by cutting off food that was reach on fats. Maybe if cut fats alltogether, wouldnt have needed Xenical.
2284	lexapro	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	always crying	i stopped crying, and could breath better	none	"just went to the doctor, explained that all i felt like doing was sighing , and how i could burst out in tears at any given time- he suggested lexapro-i resisted-didn't want drugs. went back 1 month later and said, ok, lets try it-
i stopped crying, it worked"
88	pristiq	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression	This is an NSRI, different from an SSRI because it works on more than one brain chemical. When an SSRI is ineffective or a patient finds that after a period of time a working drug stops working and symptoms of depression return they may be advised to try an NSRI. This was the case with me. I have been treated for my depression for years and had done extremely well for periods of time on several different drugs at different times. Moving from one to the next as I bottomed out on each. Celexa and Lexapro being the most recent. When Lexapro let me down after a couple of years I was advised to try Pristiq which was just released only a few months before my doctor suggested it. I was extremely hesitant as I did not want to go through another adjustment period of sleeplessness, headaches, possible weight gain, sexual issues, etc. You know the drill if you have taken drugs for deperession. So I chose to stay on my Lexapro and be depressed, hoping that it would start working again at a higher dose. Wrong. Getting to the end of my rope with my depression I finally decided to bite the bullet and try the Prestiq. My depression disappeared within 3 weeks leaving me feeling better than I had in months. I began smiling again and fully functioning doing the things I enjoy and had let slide. My sense of well being and hopefulness for the future returned.	Honestly, none for me. I sleep, did not gain an ounce, in fact I lost a small amount of weight even though I did not need to, no sexual side effect at all! Only thing that was tough was waiting for the dosage level to become theraputic in my system, which as I mentioned took about 3 weeks.	I was instructed to continue on the Lexapro at a lower dose for one week. At the 2nd week add my dose of Pristiq to the lower dose of Lexapro, at the 3rd week drop the Lexapro completely and continue on my dose of Pristiq. This was done while staying in contact with my prescribing doctor. Now I take 1 50mg tablet everyday of Pristiq, and am doing very well.

I was having up to 5 a week of the generalized ones in my sleep and getting injuries from them when I started topamax. The topamax stopped the generalization. I continued to have complex partials, but those are nothing in comparison to a tonic clonic seizure. I have only had one tonic clonic since being at the max dose of topamax.	topa-tingles (tingly fingers and toes) and tingles around my lips. This went away once my dose got to 400. Seeing light tracers. word loss. memory loss. hair loss. dry itchy skin. massive weight loss into the scary skinny territory. dangerously low potassium. I was able to reduce most of my side effects by taking potassium supplements and adding ensure drinks to my diet.	Topamax 200mg in the morning and 300mg in the evening. I started at a low dose and worked up to the effective dose that stopped my tonic clonic seizures (generalized seizures). It took additional medications to reduce my complex partial seizures, which I continue to have on occasion.
3265	zoloft	4	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	irritable bowel syndrome	Less pain with same symptoms	Unclear thinking	Condition was long term and stress related.  Zoloft was merely a measure to ease the discomfort.
1857	augmentin	3	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	suspected upper respiratory infection	The medication worked great and cleared up symptoms immediately (sore throat, coughing, et cetera).	Horrible, wretched diarrhea. I lost six pounds in five days. I could barely eat because I couldn't keep anything down. I had to survive on white bread slices, crackers and water. Anything else caused diarrhea. It was so bad that I called my doctor and asked her to prescribe me something else. She told me that the two days remaining on my perscription were just extra insurance to make sure my infection was gone before surgery. She basically said she would normally only prescribe five days so with that I discontinued use. Feel better now but still have diarrhea. Been off for 1 day.	Prescribed 875mg 2x/day for seven days but because of the horrific diarrhea, stopped at five days with doctors consent. Never again will I take Augmentin -- never.
1120	effexor	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	75 mg	Very effective initially. A lot more energy, able to focus, and more vibrant. I think its no longer working after 7 years and think I am tolerant of it and not receiving the same benefits as the initial years.	When weening off I had 'shock like' sensations.weight loss was an initial side effect as well as diarrhea. Became ill if I drank alcohol at all.	Depression med.
1501	metrogel	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	rosacea	no benefits, only negatives.	This product made my rosacea go from mild to severe in a matter of 2 days. Has now been 6 days, with no improvements of the damage done by this junk. Horrible, horrible product.  The best way to ease you rosacea is go on a diet of lemon water and plain, boiled chicken for a week. Take about 2 gm of pantothenic acid a day.  It sucks, but it will clear it up.	treatment details? What details? I have rosacea and metrogel is NOT effective, and made symptoms worse and now they don't go away at all. Thanks to our fantastic government regulations, pharmacuticals are approved by ignorant monkeys while effective, natural cures are ignored.   The best way to ease your rosacea is go on a diet of lemon water and plain, boiled chicken for a week. Take about 2 gm of pantothenic acid a day. It sucks, but it will clear it up. I'm sure a doctor will argue it and insist that some Gualderm product is better, but we all know how that works....
3216	penlac	1	Ineffective	No Side Effects	toenail fungus	None - did not work	No Side effects	Topical application did not work.  Tried other prescription drugs as well (topical) but did not work.  Finally was advised to try a 1:5 solution of white vinegar and this cleared up the issue.  The vinegar made the nail bed inhospitable to fungus and nails grew in perfect, solving this 20+ year problem that plagued me.  I recommend anyone suffering from nail bed fungus to try this.  I put the solution in plastic bags tied with elastic bands and walked around with them for an hour a day.  Small price to pay for relief of this nasty affliction.
530	trazodone	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	insomnia	Sleeping through the night	Grogginess in the morning	Nightly use, one hour before bed.
2817	wellbutrin	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	After taking Wellbutrin for approximately 2 months I noticed a considerable decrease in anxiety and morbid intrusive thoughts, which improved my depression feeling considerably. I also noticed that I had an easier time quitting smoking. I could be around smokers and not feel an urge to smoke, which had never happened in previous attempts to quit and using a nicotine patch.	During the first month I had insomnia. I slept about 3 hrs per night; however, I didn't feel fatigued by it. I also lost about 20 lbs in the first 6 months.	My doctor prescribed Wellbutrin for depression and anxiety. I take 150mg two times per day.
2975	strattera	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	adhd	Slowed down hyperactivity in a nine year old boy; increased attending a little bit although not strongly.  It does not interfere with sleep which many of the stimpulant meds do.  There were no mood swings until the dosage was increased.	When the dose was raised, the patient suffered suicidal ideation!  This was bad.  At lower dose it seemed to be ok.  Dosage takes 2-3 weeks to take affect.  Side effects also will not be observed until dose builds up in the system.  You may see lesser instances of self denegration first.  Watch for that.	Take pill once a day
2216	benicar-hct	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypertension	lowered blood presssure with no notable side effects.The reduction in blood pressure was immediate with no other bothersome side effects	none -- i was warned that many blood pressure medications have bothersome side-effects including lowered libido, sleep disturbances etc.  i suffered no change in any physiological symptoms other than the lowering of my blood pressure	Take the medication once per day and take measures to reduce the sources of stress in my life as well as take measures to more efficiently deal with existant daily stress.
4048	amoxil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	h-pylori	I took these medications while having severe symptoms of h-pylori which had been going on already for about 10 days(severe stomach pain).  After about 3 days on the medication my syptoms were much improved and soon disappeared.  Before taking this medication I would have bouts of this pain every few months during stressful times and it would take weeks to go away.  Since taking this medication during that three week period two years ago I have had no more syptoms of h-pylori despite several stressful time periods.	I don't remember any. (except sensitivity to sun with flagyl)	I took these two medications along with flagyl for three weeks, 3 times a day (this is my memory of it).  Fantastic!
148	zmax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	tonsillitis	Fast results vs. traditional antibiotics such as amoxicillin.	none	I had two cases of bacterial tonsillitis four months apart. Both times the doctor did not want to prescribe antibiotics, however, I had had one case of bacterial tonsillitis several years ago and I knew that amoxicillin did not cure it. I requested a stronger antibiotic than amoxicillin. The doctor would not prescribe it. After several days of excruciating pain plus Tylenol with Codeine I begged for a stronger antibiotic. When Z-pak was prescribed, the antibiotic began taking effect in just a few hours. In 24 hours my symptoms were greatly reduced and the tonsillitis was cured in just a few more days.
2717	elavil	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraines	The elavil was taken as a preventative measure for migraines.  I did have fewer migraines while I was taking this medication.  The ones that I did get seemed to be less severe.	I took it at night and it made it very difficult to wake up in the morning.  Also, after I took it, I would go right to sleep but if something woke me up within the first few hours of taking it, I had a VERy hard time going back to sleep.	"I took 25 to 50 mgs at bedtime for about 18 months.  I took myself off of it because I was tired of the ""hangover"" effect.  Since that time, the headaches are much less of a problem."
3686	effexor-xr	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Worked very fast, could feel results within a week. Very effective in lifting severe depression and reduced frequency of panick attacks (though did not eliminate them entirely)	Some insomnia, very vivid dreams, sweating at night. DO NOT MISS DOSES OR STOP TAKING...discontinuation happens really quickly and is the harshest I've ever felt (I've come off of Lexapro, amitriptyline and nortriptyline) Also my heartrate has increased slightly.	Went up to 300mg a day from the starters pack within a few months of starting it.  Lifted a very deep depression; at the time it was a godsend. After a year of being on it at 300mg it is starting to lose effectiveness (which I am told is typical) so I will either have to switch or add something because I can't increase much more.
1274	provigil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	narcolepsy	After being diagnosed with narcolepsy, Provigil changed my life.  I had learned to live eternally tired and able to fall asleep at a moment's notice.  After a sleep study revealed narcolepsy and I started on Provigil, I feel as if I've been given a second chance at life.  Provigil helps me to stay awake and be alert....I no longer feel fatigued and always wanting to sleep.  Provigil is an amazing drug and thank God it's available!!!!	none	400 mg every morning, 200 mg early afternoon.
1629	premarin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	partial hysterectomy	Had to have a partial hysterectomy due to endometreosis.  After the surgery began experiencing hot flashes on a very frequent basis - approximately 1-2 times per hour.  My gynecologist prescribed Premarin .030mg.  Since then I have moved up to the .045 mg dosage which I take once a day.  For the most part, this relieves my symptoms even though I wake up at night on occasion with a night sweat.	periodic headaches	take once daily for relief of menopause symptoms
3531	lunesta	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	I started having insomnia due to some family issues and had to start taking sleeping pills.

My mood was lifted.	The first day I didn't take Mobic(Day 5) I experienced withdrawal like symptoms. Didn't want to get out of bed after eight hours of undisturbed sleep. Severe stomach cramping followed by diarrhea. I feel really strange. I can't focus. My pain is back. Face feels tingly. I have a shaky feeling. Nauseous. As the day progresses I am feeling less of these symptoms. I don't think it's worth all this.	Physical therapy twice a week. Doctor every two weeks. Suppose to take 1-2 Mobic everyday for pain. 1-3 Flexiril a day to relax tense muscles. I take Flexiril at night because it knocks me out. But have only needed it the first two days of treatment.
3937	nexium	7	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	stomach acid/reflux	The nexium was highly successful in calming the stomach acid. However, it took a long time to do so effectively.

1083	effexor	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraine	"I suffered from debilitating migraines.  The first treatments of anti-depressants were effective, but the side effects became intolerable.  After 
trying other types of medications, Effexor (both XR and regular release) have been a blessing. I suffer no side effects and in the laast 5 years have only had to increase the dosage one time."	"Previous medications (Nortrytpaline, amatryptaline) had a major sedative reaction.  I was unable to get up in the mornings and was sleepy all day long.
Also a dry mouth contributed to tooth decay as I was always having some sort of 
mint or candy or gum in my mouth."	My Effexor treatments as simple, just take the drug once a day on the extended release type.
3397	proscar	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	hair loss	Immediate slowing of loss, but the benefits waned after the first year.	Mild testicular ache, reduced ejaculate	Proscar was cut into 4 pieces and 1.25 mg were taken daily for over 2 years. There was immediate cessation of loss and moderate amounts of regrowth. Return to baseline, and then drastic fall below baseline, was observed in the year subsequent to drug initiation.

1253	tapazole	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hyperthyroidism	My hyperthyroidism is in remission 9 months after stopping the drug.  I had no side effects and even my thyroid nodules are gone.  Pretty amazing!!	None - I felt no different at all	I took the tapazole daily along with atenolol for the shaking and heart racing I was experiencing.  I am completely drug free for 9 months and the thyroid is fine.  I am so glad I didn't let the doctors irradiate the gland to ablate it.  I would have had to be on synthoid forever.
3687	effexor-xr	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression, social anxiety disorder	After a few months of treatment, I was actually able to function and get my social anxiety under control. My emotions became intact, and I enjoyed doing things again.	Missing a dose of this medication is HORRIBLE. I start feeling withdrawal symptoms after 24 hours of not taking my medication. I once went 3 days without the 75mg pills, and I thought I was going to die. I was in a constant spin, I cried the whole time, I was exhausted, but I couldn't lay still. I was so nauseous that I couldn't eat and dry heaved for days. I literally thought I was going to die. DO NOT MISS A DOSE OF THIS MEDICATION!! In the beginning of treatment, I started out with 37.5mg pills and I did feel nauseous and dizzy for the first few days until my body adjusted, but it was nothing compared to how I would be feeling in 2 weeks! I do think this medication completely killed my sex drive. I don't have the urge to be intimate at all.	I must say, I got extremely lucky with this medication. It was the first one I tried, and the only one I had to try. I was 19 when I starting taking this medication and was just starting my first year of college. I lived in an apartment with my boyfriend and attended school, no job. But that's all I did. Never made it out of the apartment, never went out, I lived in a huge city, made no friends, just an absolute mess. My emotions were a wreck and I felt absolutely helpless. I cried alll the time and I started having panic attacks out of nowhere, which I had absolutely NO idea what was going on. I just dealt with them in horror. I drank and did drugs, but it only made things worse. My doctor prescribed this drug and it did absolute wonders, within a week, I was starting to feel the weight being lifted off my shoulders. Within 3 weeks, I was able to drive in traffic, and open my blinds to let the sun in. Within 2 months, I was back to normal! I have the occasional off days, but who doesn't? The thought of possibly being dependent on this medication scares me because of how hard it's said to be weaned off of it, but I'm too scared to even TRY coming off effexor because of the withdrawal symptoms I experienced before. Overall, this medication is amazing, and does wonders.
1578	xanax	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	I was experiencing anxiety and would take a quarter of a pill to take the edge off.  Within 20-30 minutes the anxiety would decrease a lot.  Mostly I wouldn't even have a full pill in a day.	If I took the recommended dose (half to a full pill) I would get very tired.  Once I tested different dosages and decreased it to a quarter, I cannot remember any side effects.	The way it was prescribed I was to take up to one pill and I could take it every 4 hours.  That dosage was way to high for me so I decreased it to a quarter of a pill and only took it when I had extreme anxiety.  One bottle of 30 lasted me two years.  I almost never go to the doctor and I never really take drugs unless it is absolutely necessary.  I wanted to do your survey so I could get the free report on making home creams, but I also really like what you are doing!
2187	clonazepam	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety/ panic attacks/ insomnia	The drug was taken for my daily anxiety caused by stress and also insomnia to help relax my body before bed. The drug is mainly intended for anxiety and works great at relieving those systems such as irregular heart beat, nervousness and other anxiety causing symptoms. I give it a 9 out of 10 for its performance.	The only thing i didnt like about this drug is that with taking it overtime I felt as if my body built tolerance to the drug as well as became more dependent on it. I still am until this day and have managed to ween off the drug. Then again every ones body is different, Just do your research before taking benzodiazepines long term.	The treatment overall treated my anxiety quickly and effectively. No regrets. The drug overall has treated me effectively despite the minor drawbacks.
4061	amoxil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	sore throat with a low grade fever	My son is generally very leary of any type of medicine and even throws up certain cough syrups and acetaminophens that I would give him.  I had two concerns for this oral medication.  First, I was skeptical that this prescription for amoxicillin would be any different in terms of taste and that my son would also throw it up.  Also, being that my son is a diabetic coupled with the fact that he was sick, I was concerned that this medication might have sugars that would affect his blood sugar readings.  I found no real difference in his health for the first two to three days but in the days following, his health improved dramatically to the point where we almost forgot to take it.  Understanding that the antibiotic needed to be taken for the full ten days in order to be the most effective, we continued to take it to the end of the ten days.	My son did not notice/experience any side effects.  There did not seem to be any physical reaction with the drug except that he became better within days.	I gave my son a teaspoon of amoxicillin after each of three meals per day for ten days in total.
1388	benzaclin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	This has helped reduce my cystic acne that forms on my chin area. Nothing has helped previously.I had tried OTC products including Proactiv as well as RX differin. The cysts still occur occasionally but with far less frequency.	dryness	Applied daily in the evening. At first sign of a cyst forming I usually apply it twice daily.
1	nasonex	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	congested sinuses	Traeatment with Nasonex was effective at controlling some of my congestion before sinus surgery and all of it after surgery.  The treatment also controlled my allergies to cats and dogs as a bonus!  I stayed 4 days at a freinds house with a dog and was without sneezing and stuffiness, however my asthma was still an issue.	Immediate side effects that I noticed were with my immune system.  I got sick (colds and upper respiratory infections) more easily and I had one bug bite that became infected and took a long time to heal.  I also noticed that I put on a few pounds (2-3) but am not sure if that is related or not.	Began treatment with spray before sinus surgery and continued after surgery.  6 months after surgery, the spray was stopped.
2218	benicar-hct	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	hypertension	Blood pressure was decreased initially to where it should have been, and gradually stopped being so effective	Severe rectal pain, beginning around 4 weeks into the treatment. At first there was burning, after bowel movements, then increased to severe burning all the time, then to pain, and finally severe pain (could not sit or lay down). No hemorrhoids, tears, or fisures, but the pain continued, even if no bowel movements for days. Finally stopped taking the medication at the end of August 2009, but the symptoms continue even now (Feb 2010), although not nearly as bad. Now the pain just makes me sit sideways, but at least I can sit and lay down to sleep.	I had never been diagnosed with high blood pressure, but had recently gained several pounds because of the double round of steroids I was put on because of a severe skin rash (seasonal allergic reaction). Since we had recently moved I didn't have a PCP yet and the rash on my arms looked like it may have been getting infected, I went to a local emergent care center and saw a doctor there. They took my blood pressure and immediately put me on Benicar HCT, 20 mg, once a day. I took the medication as prescribed until the anal pain got to be too bad. Since going off the medication my BP is a little elevated but I'm reluctant to go back on any meds, especially no one seems to be willing to admit the Benicar caused this problem or is offering any solutions to help it get better.

Now need to take higher dose for similar effect.  Has not worked as well since name brand was sold to different company and shape change.  I wonder if there are women having same problem.  Had surgical menopause for 19 years.

Significant reduction in anxiety, moodiness, and certain obsessive compulsive traits.	None	Patient suffering from severe depression prior to medication.

1805	oxycontin	3	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	back pain	It provided me Pain releif that enabled me to get up in the morning and pain releif that helped with cramps and pain while sleeping at night. I think it only blocked the pain receptor in my brain but didn't actually provide a cure for the main problem. It was like a mask that may have caused more damagae in the end	I became severely addicted to the drug. With flu like symptoms when out of meds. I became dependant on the meds everyday to function and because it was working for enabling me to go about my day I didn't look for a proper treatment. In the end I wouldn't say that these pain medication do anything but mask the initial problem and my Dr considered the problem solved and didn't seek an alternate method of helping me long term	Take one pill 2 times a day
381	lamotrigine	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	ptsd	I have never felt so good in my life. This drug doesn't make you happy but it gives you a stable state to work from. I also read self-help books and have therapy along with the medicine but I wouldn't have been able to not have extreme highs and lows without Lamotrigine. It saved my relationships and my sanity. Thank God for this medicine.	Yeast infections occasionally.	"In therapy weekly and using ""Feeling Good"" and ""Break the Chain of Low Self-Esteem""."
3540	vivelle-dot	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	low estragen	I had more energy, better disposition and I slept better. This hormone therapy is great. I think most menopausal women should take it. It made me feel more like my old self.	I had absolutely no side effects.	I put on a new patch twice a week. I recommend Vivelle Dot to most women.
942	levaquin	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	sinusitis	Although I took this drug about 3 to 4 days before I realized it was making me sicker, there were no treatment benefits during the time I was on it.  Actually , I started feel worse about day 3 or 4.  The drug seemed to be enhancing the sinusitus symptoms!	The treatment side effects of Levaquin were very similar to my sinusitis symptoms, hence the fact I stayed on the drug for several days.  Side effects included headache, dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea (nausea is not a symptom of sinusitus that I ever experienced before).  The side effects slowly got worse the longer I took the drug.	I asked for the drug in liquid form, as I have difficulty swallowing many pills.  I took the drug as recommended, but the symptoms did not get better.  As I mentioned earlier, the symptoms got worse.  I called my doctor's office on the third day and was told that the symptoms I was experiencing was the infection.  By day 5 I knew it was the drug, and stopped taking it.  After a couple of days the nausea went away, and eventually the sinusitus infection slowly got better.  I will never take Levaquin again!
623	finacea	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acne & rosacea	Finacea works well, is my everyday solution to acne and rosacea, but I still have occasional breakouts which are more quickly dried up by using Neutragena salicylic acid spot products.  Finacea has a creamier texture, so doesn't dry my skin as much as other products or irritate it, causing redness.  I still require a light moisurizer, in addition to it and the CeraVe moisturizing product that has been packaged with Finacea in a recent promotion works well with it.	None	I apply it over my entire face (except for eye areas)after washing and toning, but before moisturizing or applying wrinkle reduction cream.
3673	effexor-xr	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I have been on Effexor XR for about 10 years. I am currently taking 300 mg per day. Before going on Effexor XR I was a crazy person...I tried to commit suicide several times. I still had anger issues and was given Lamictal and my anger has decreased immensely. I had been on so many different antidepressants I thought this was how my life was always going to be, my family slowly watching me sleep myself to death. Since my doctor put me on Effexor XR added Lamictal & Desyrel I feel better than ever. I also found out I'm allergic to wheat, dairy & eggs. Deleting these items from my diet along with the medications has made me a new person.	The only adverse effect I experienced was when I tried to play doctor and wean myself from the meds. It was like withdrawals from hard drugs; chills, nausea, etc. I took periodically myself off my meds because I didn't want to be dependant on medicaton. It was always the wrong thing to do.	My Dr gave me a sample pack (containing 7-37.5 mg capsules & 7-75mg capsules) as well as a  prescription for 75 mg. I was to take the 37.5 mg capsules then the 75 mg capsules. The dosage has been increased over time to 300mg.

689	accutane	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne vulgaris	The problem, Acne Vulgaris, did disappear	Some days of severe depression, extremely dry skin	"In the first few weeks I couldn�t see any changes in my skin�s condition but dryness. Then, after ca. 6-8 weeks the skin became more and more clean and soft. The treatment lasted about 4 month and was highly effective. No Acne after stopping to take the Accutane.
The skin would remain drier than usual several years after the treatment had been finished and it would be clean.
I can recommend it to people who have severe Acne vulgaris."
70	flexeril	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	muscle spasm/neck and upper back pain	It allowed me to relax and sleep.  My neck and back pain subsided a little.  It made me forget most of my pain.	drowsy when i first woke up but once i got moving around it went away	The doctor had me take flexeril 3 times a day but i started out with 1 at bedtime for 2 1/2 weeks.

1785	citalopram	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression, anxiety	After about 2 weeks, felt much calmer and less depressed. Stressful situations or emotional distress were experienced less acutely and I was able to deal with them much better. Overall feeling of 'who cares' but not to a bad extent.  Also lost about 20 pounds which may be due to it acting as an appetite suppressant? Or maybe because it stopped my stress eating. Either way, nice side effect :)	Loss of weight- appetite suppression. Complete loss of sexual interest. Kind of a bummer but preferable to the depression. Also experienced an episode of intense confusion around the time it was supposed to be kicking in.	Works great... Very happy with it, as alprazolam seems to have no effect on me.
568	atenolol	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	heart racing and fluttering	this drug works very well to control my heart from racing and fluttering. i have had a echo cardiogram and they say it is nothing serious but it really bothers me and makes me shaky and queasy. it was nice to get relief from this drug.	when i first took it it seemed to make me depressed but after a while that seemed to go away. other than that i have had no side effects.	the doctor prescribed the drug and i take 1/2 tablet a day which would be 25 mg.
2161	zyrtec	5	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	allergies	After moving to Okalahoma, allergies became a problem.  Different medicines prescribed and over the counter were tried.  At one point, I had to visit the doctor every six months two get a B12 shot and a steroid shot.  I was not pleased with the such frequent visits to the doctor's office but needed a treat for my new found allergies that were really affecting my work and family life.	A rash on my face occurred after two days and the medicine made very anxious. After moving to Okalahoma, allergies became a problem.  Different medicines prescribed and over the counter were tried.  At one point, I had to visit the doctor every six months two get a B12 shot and a steroid shot.  I was not pleased with the such frequent visits to the doctor's office but needed a treat for my new found allergies that were really affecting my work and family life. Both my 4 year old son and I tried Zyrtec.  We both had an allergic reaction in the form of a rash on our face.	Allergies are very common in Oklahoma because of the ragweed. Different medicines prescribed and over the counter were tried.  At one point, I had to visit the doctor every six months two get a B12 shot and a steroid shot.  I was not pleased with the such frequent visits to the doctor's office but needed a treat for my new found allergies that were really affecting my work and family life. I began taking 1 tsp onf Zyrtec once per day.  The drug proved to work.
85	methimazole	5	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	hyperthyroidism	"Stabilizes my thyroid function and brings it into a ""normal"" range.
Consequently my heart rate normalizes"	"Early in treatment Drs. would give me a specific dose to take for as long as 6 weeks. During this amount of time, on say..30-20 mgs per day, my thyroid would become so enlarged, I could barely swallow..

ALSO--I now have Osteopenia."	"First need to say Drs. waned me to have thyroid ablation. I opted to ""keep"" my thyroid and treat with mediycation, rather than ""killing it off"" chemically and becoming HYPO-Thyroid and treating with a replacement ""synthroid"" type meds.

2072	metformin	3	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	diabetes	There was no perceptible benefit to the patient from his point of view; there was an apparent improvement as measured by the doctor.  The doctor advised continuation of the treatment.	There was no perceptible side effect experienced by the patient; this is possibly possibly due to the inattentive nature of the patients deep depression.  The patient also had extreme sleep apnea.

Withdrawl is EXTREME. Constant crying, very vivid and disturbing dreams, general listlessness."	Taken once a day (until up to 150 mg/day and then taken twice a day).  Always in the morning, as would help with insomnia.
117	valtrex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	shingles	Prior to starting 1000 mg acyclovir QID, I was taking the standard 200 mg 5 times a day regimin.  I devloped the shingles in the 5th cranial nerve.  I had lesions following the entire nerve roots across my face, but had them internally as well.  There were lesions in the ear canal, the side of my tongue and down my throat.  I had taken a flu shot and had exposure to sun, as well as starting 2 new jobs about the same time as the first onset.  I developed 1 blister which I thought was herpes. I had not had a herpes outbreak in years. I started the acyclovir and noticed more and different complaints every day.  I first got a lesion on the entrance to the ear canal and more accompanying the first one on my lower chin.  Then my lower teeth began to become painful, as if I had a great toothache.  After about 4 days, I began to feel exhausted and unable to snap out of my fatigue.  The next day I awoke and had a sensation that my mouth was not fully moving.  Later the eye began to remain open and would not blink. The 3rd day of these symtoms, I devloped total paralysis of the left face. I saw 1 of my doctors immediately.  He gave me a cortisone shot and told me the dose of acyclovir to take.  He said it was bell's palsey. A friend called and said it was Ramsay-Hunt.  I was on bedrest from Mid October until 2 weeks ago.  I have very little stamina, and slowly I am getting more energy.  The latest addition to my medication arsenal was Alpha-lipoic acid.  I had statrted lysine and red marine algae.  I stopped coffe, soda, most meat and ate only what little I cooked or made myself.  I am pleased that most of my facial functions have returned, with the exception of the eye bliking completely, and a slight difference in my smile.  I take at least 1 dose of ibuprophen every day due to neuralgia or a sense of swelling in my left face.	I did not notice any.	acyclovir, rest.  PRN doses of ibuprophen.

2926	tramadol	5	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	migranes	Very effective in my sleep pattern	Drowsiness which was not a major issue for me. phase of depression each time i stopped taking the pill. I didn't realize what was causing it until after the last couple of times. I mean a serious phase of depression which was new to me since i have never experienced depression before	I took the pill only when i had a migrane for a period of 3 months. I would be okay before and while i took the pill. The low mood, feelings of unworthiness and a heavy feeling in my head that i can't explain any better
3383	lipitor	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	high blood cholesterol levels	My blood cholesterol decreased from 260 to 190-210 and my LDLs dropped  and now hover around 100 mg/dl; always had high HDL levels of 84-92.  Needed to keep my VLDLs low too.	No side effects	high cholesterol, 260, at menopause and 2 younger brothers with heart attacks in early 50s.  Both brothers had high blood VLDLs.  So took Lipitor to keep blood cholesterol levels down because of family history of high blood cholesterol on both maternal and paternal sides of family.

3253	cleocin	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	during 20's and 30's it appeared to create a protective skin barrier and keep acne at bay	"suspect that long-term over-use of this anti-biotic is part of the domino effect
that disrupted immune system which set stage for cancer diagnosis at age 40"	"used to put clindamycin lotion on face every morning after cleansing to create an antibiotic shield to protect skin from contamination that might aggravate acne ... that, plus the birth control pills taken during 20's and 30's likely

1753	topamax	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine	The number of migraines were reduced from 20+ a month to 12 or even less.  There have been some months when I have had only 5 or less migraines.  More importantly, the intensity of the migraines is considerably reduced.  On a pain scale of 1-10, I would have 12 or 15+ pain, that no amount of medication helped, and they would last for 3 to 5 days.  Now, when I do get a migraine, it's usually at a 2 or 3 pain level, and I rarely need to take more than 1 Relpax for relief.	One rather odd side effect, which others on the drug have commented upon, is that you forget words.  I've always been very articulate, and it can be frustrating to be in the middle of a conversation, or when I was doing training sessions, to suddenly go blank and be completely unable to remember a word I've used all my life.  Also, at one point I decided to go off the medication in the vain hope I could manage the migraines without drugs.  Even coming off the Topamax over a period of months, I gained 20 pounds.	I started on the usual dosage of 25mg in the morning and evening, then after 2 weeks increased it to 50mg twice a day.  Most people stay at this level, however, I seem to have a very high metablisim when it comes to medication, and anything I've taken for migraines always has to be increased beyond normal dosage in order to work.  Therefore, my neurologist increased the dosage to 200 mg a day, and after about a year when that no longer worked, we went to 300mg a day, which I know is high for used in migraine treatment. However, I've been on almost every migraine medication there is over the years, and there is nothing else that works.  I'm hoping for more breakthroughs in migraine research, before I end up at 400mg a day and forget half my vocabulary!
2813	wellbutrin	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression/anxiety	Decreased depression	felt funny and would get sort of dizzy	"I switched from Zoloft to Wellbutrin because it seemed like Zoloft was increasing my appetite a lot. I originally was treated with Zoloft for a severe episode of depression. After switching to Wellbutrin and taking it for a few months I continued to experience the original relief I had gotten from depression by taking Zoloft. It is possible however that I no longer needed anti-depressants. 
I stopped taking Wellbutrin b/c while taking it, a few times a day I would feel pretty strange physically for a few moments. I found this frightening so I didn't want to continue taking it."
2022	protonix	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	reflux	Benefits of Protonix were a greatly reduced incidence of heartburn and spams in the esophagus.	None	I took the Protonix once a day approxiamtely 30 minutes before eating breakfast.
3863	levoxyl	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	The drug reduced symptoms of tiredness and moodiness.   Hair loss was also seemed to improve.	none known	Pill taken 1/day for life.   Dosage must be monitored over time and may need to be adjusted.  May take several different dosages to be tried before optimal perscription is determined for your body.   Also, in filling the perscription specify non-generic.
3235	nuvaring	5	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pregnancy	I have not gotten pregnate while using, and I can usually not tell the ring is there.	I had a severe headache that lasted a week. Vaginal iching. Loss of sexual desire.	Insert one ring for three weeks, then take out for one week. I do know someone with a blood clot that could've lead to a stroke or heartattack while using.
1580	xanax	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	I was able to relax more than usual, and my mind did not feel like a race car circling a track at 150 miles per hour.  It became easier to focus on the task at hand without worrying about what was on my to-do list and, due to an eating disorder, how much I had eaten or was going to eat that day.	I found it slightly more difficult to drive while under the influence of the drug, and oftentimes I caught myself spacing out.  Sun exposure seemed to strengthen the drug's effect, and being in the sun made me lethargic and sometimes even dizzy.  Overall, I always felt as though I was on an irregular level of consciousness, and not in the same mental place as surrounding people not on the drug.	I was told to take one or 1/2 tablet approximately 30 minutes before undergoing an event that I predicted would inflict anxiety.  My stress was effectively reduced during family meals and going out to restaurants.  However, I took 1/2 tablet before receiving a vaccination shot and, although I did not pass out as usual, I still became lightheaded and dizzy as a result of the needle.  Perhaps a whole tablet would have eliminated these effects.  In the end, I couldn't get used to feeling like I was on drugs while trying to work, drive, etc. so I decided to not refill my prescription and began seeing my therapist more often instead.
3596	differin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	uneven skin colour, anti-aging	My skin has become dramatically clearer and it has a fresh glow that I am very happy with.  My skin is smoother, finer, and the darker areas on my forehead (related to sun exposure) have faded almost completely.	Mild redness in the first three or four weeks, especially after exfoliating in the morning (which is my habit, not something recommended by my dermatologist though I have not asked).  It is a lot more urgent that I get moisturizer on after washing my face in the morning than it used to be before starting this treatment.  My face feels very tight and uncomfortable until I get the moisturizer on.	Before the treatment, I had noticed my skin was becoming dull and a bit leathery, and some wrinkles were setting in to my forehead. This is all substantially improved, and I'm so glad I shelled out for this cream.
2811	wellbutrin	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	My dosage is NOT the standard treatment of 300 mg daily, however at the 100 mg daily dose I get some benefits, including decreased irritability and appetite control, without side effects.	None.	I have been on this medication, at this dosage for a few years now, and it works great. No side effects at the 100 mg per day dose but I still get the benefits of help with mood swings and appetite control.
2078	metformin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	diabetes	Totally under control	Byetta had slight nausea effects at first	I take Byetta imj twice a day before meals and metformin morning and night.  The Lipitor is taken at night and the synthroid in the am before meals.  My A1c is 5.2 and have kept off of insulin for 4 years.  Diet and exercise have also factored into the treatment.  I am totally under control.
1516	glucophage	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pcos/insulin resistance	I went to the doctor complain of never losing weight despite dieting and exercises, and after some medical evaluation , I was diagnosed with severe insulin resistance, polycysitc ovary syndrome , and hypothyroid ,all which contributed to weight problem  , my doctors plan was to take metformin at the maximum dose , 850 mg , 3 times and and to start a medication for my throid , within 3 months I had lost 20 pounds , normalized my periods and reversed my insulin resistance I was instructed to keep taking metformin  for the rest of my life	gastric side effects	I was instructed to tae the drug 3 times a day infintely
1668	climara	5	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	perimenopause	I began taking Climara for perimenopause issues-- insomnia, horrible PMS, moodiness, night sweats. It helped for these issues.	The main side effects I experienced with Climara were bloating, weight gain and indigestion/gas. I gained 8 pounds in two months! As soon as I stopped the drug, the bloating and gas disappeared, and my weight gain is returning to normal.	Climara is meant to be used with a complementary progesterone subscription. I took  it in pill form. Now I am planning to try Amberen, a natural supplement which is supposed to balance the endocrine system. Got my fingers crossed!
1298	zocor	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high cholerterol	lowered cholesterol by 13% with no side effects	there were no side effects from the dosage I take	One pill daily to reduce bad cholesterol with no side effects, I didn't really change my diet and the simvastatin reduced cholesterol by 13-15%. I get yearly blood test to see if it effected my liver and so far have had no problems.
2380	synthroid	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypothyroidism	Clearer thinking; improved outlook and energy level.	I have had a persistent cough since taking this drug.	Taken first thing with glass of water and no food for 30 minutes. Doctor did not see the connection between cough and Synthroid,(chest Xray came back fine) however as it did bother my stomach briefly at time of dosing, I decided it might be affecting the stomach lining. Recently towards late afternoon or before retiring will take Tagamet or some generic stomach med. I DO NOT experience heartburn, however, this routine seems to reduce the embarrassing cough significantly. This was my own resolution after trying many allergy medicines once or twice which did not stop the cough at all. Was also given sample of Advair which I did not use due to negative side effects I read about on internet before using. I am seeking a more natural and effective solution to replace the Synthroid with something that will treat source of low thyroid as well as the symptoms.
1115	effexor	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	stopped depression ie. repeatative negative thoughts, suicidal thougts, and general malaise.  relieved insomnia.	Bizarre dreams on nightly basis.  Possibly digestive problems.	I started on effexor after a serious suicide attempt following chronic sleep deprevation.  The trazadone was quickly added.  I effectively slept and within several weeks of taking both medications (taking the effexor and trazadone at bedtime) found my depression relieved.
4040	tri-luma	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	melasma	excellent!!!! been using on and off for about 5 yrs now. I have learned how this works so theres no side effects such as really dry flaky skin. i use a little in the am then at night.I do this for about 2 wks. Meanwhile i DO NOT use any scrubs or rub my face , just gently, also NO masks or toners etc. Close to 2 wks, when in a hot shower gentle exfoliate, you will see dead skin coming off. dry your face and ts gonna look dry, flaky and terrible. use PURE COCOBUTTER on your face during the day, then only at night use the triluma, and repeat the exfoliate every few days, then the cocobutter etc, until you get results. My face looks amazing after using this process, but i do not have acne, so not sure how it would  work with the cocobutter, might make the acne worse.  good luck!	dry skin	explained above
1776	citalopram	6	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression/anxiety	I did not notice any benefit myself, although my wife felt I was less 'Snappy'. Hoping to get more benefits now I have moved up to a higher dose.	Waking up in the night and not being able to sleep. Shaking. Nervousness. Agitation. Sweating. Increased sex drive. Upset stomach/ flatulance. Tiredness. Dejavous.	"I am writing this having just been back to the GP's as I did not think it was working as well as it could do according to other reports. He raised me up to 40mg from an initial dose of 20mg. 
As you can see I have listed a lot of side effects, although to be honest these were not a problem and mostly gone by 10days of treatment. That is until I got raised to 40mg and now they are back with a vengeance. 
However, if it helps with the depression it will be worth it. I have my tablet with food as otherwise I get a dodgy stomach, but for some people they may need to take it without food for the same reason. Again, if it makes you tired, take on an evening, if it keeps you awake then take on the morning."
2217	benicar-hct	8	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high blood pressure	The benefits were that it did help lower my blood pressure.	With the HCT added to the Benicar, I was constantly going to the bathroom.  My potassium got so low on this medication that I am currently taking 3 potassium pills daily.	Benicar/HCT was taken once a day due to my blood pressure being high.  It did help control my blood pressure, if I ever forgot to take it I could feel the results - headache, etc.  When I first began taking it I felt really tired all the time but eventually got used to it.  I started losing weight (not because of the medication, I was actually trying to lose weight) and my potassium got so low that my physician took me off of the HCT part and started me just on the Benicar 40 mg daily.  I am still taking potassium pills until my labs show that my potassium is okay.
311	protopic	4	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	eczema	Got rid of eczema quickly when applied in a thin layer. I have used this for years without realizing its side effects or being told about the side effects from my doctors or pharmacist.	This drug has severe side effects, and I was not told about ANY of them! I believe I have gotten shingles as a side effect from this drug. Shingles tends to happen to the elderly or people with weakened immune systems. My immune system was weakened by this drug enough to get shingles!  Do your research before continuing to choose to use this product.	"Applied whenever I had a flare-up with a thin layer of the Protopic ointment. 
Please educate yourself and try many other alternatives before even considering using this product. I have used it for many years and regret it after learning about all the harmful side effects."
1835	yasmin	3	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	birth control	Less acne, more controlled cycle	headaches, dizzy spells, extreme breast tenderness (like someone is crushing them), anxiety, slight depression, very bad cramps, very large clots, mood swings, heart palpitations	Got on Yasmin to weaken my flow, my acne from the previous pill went away (ortho tri clyclen-lo), everything seemed great. I was slightly discouraged about my weight gain, a few pounds here and there, but 2 years later I am 40lbs heavier than I was when I started this pill. I do not solely blame the pill for this but I can imagine it has aided me in packing on the pounds. I exercise regularly and try to watch what I put in my mouth. I have random weird mood-swings that only seem to be getting worse. I stopped taking this pill the other day because I couldnt stand always being tired, fatigued, moody, and the headaches were unbearable. I have had a few since that day but hopefully everything will start to get better. I am looking for alternative pills because most of them make my acne really bad, and I have never had acne as a teenager. My mothers friends daughter was only on this pill 3 months and had liver problems. My health isnt worth it. I would rather bleed for 8-9 days than possibly die. Be careful ladies.
2546	zetia	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	high cholestrol	My target was to have the a cholestrol reduction from 240 to under 200. I did not want want to take statins because I am not comfortable with drugs that inhibit normal metabolic processes. Evolution is parsimonius, and inhibition of any enzyme is likely to be reflected as an adverse effect in a seemingly unrelated area. Also, I did not want to take red yeast rice, which basically is a non-phrmaceutical grade of a statin. I liked the physical mode of action of Zetia. Within 6 months of starting treatment, my total cholesterol was down from to 200 and my HDL went up from 45 to 58.	I did not experience any perceptible side effects.	See treatment benefits above. I take my daily dose of Zetia shortly after having my breakfast.
3508	atacand	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	The Atacand worked well for me IF taken consistently without skipping days.  I was able to bring my blood pressure to at least 120/80 and at times a bit lower.  Note that consistency of medication is a key.  Should the 8mg tablet taken once per day not prove as effective as desired, my physician advised that I could take an additional tablet or two per day without problem.	Did not notice any undesirable side effects.  The only thing that could be mentioned is that if one embarks on a significant exercise routine such as elleptical stairstep machine for 30+ minutes/day and keeps up the exercise for weeks on end while at the same time taking the Atacand, one may end up with a [not undesirable] blood pressure in the 112/65 range.	The Atacand worked well IF taken routinely without skipping days.  It takes a while for the regulation to start, ie, you can't begin from scratch taking the Atacand the first morning and expect proper blood pressure regulation that afternoon.  Doesn't work that quickly.  There is a tendency, after taking the medication consistently and seeing your pressure get well under control, to think that maybe you can stop or at least taper off of the Atacand.  One may try this but will find that the best regimen is consistency.  It did work well for me and keeps me under 120/80.
986	antivert	10	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	labyrinthitis	Decreased the vertigo almost immediately; no further vomiting; I was able to walk and move my head without the awful spinning.	Sedation--I almost the entire time I took the medication...I'm not sure I could have taken this and gone to work.	My doctor said the Labyrinthitis is usually preceded by a cold and fluid collects in the inner portion of the ear and causes the dizziness/vomiting.  The treatment was symptom relief (using the Meclizine) and the fluid gradually absorbs.
2796	wellbutrin	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	more motivation,stopped crying in the morning,improved feelings of wellbeing,I could enjoy music and started singing spontaniously at times,something Ihad'nt done in years	dry mouth at first week then no side effects ,even when I went up to a dose of 500mg a day under the care of a psychatrist	ruled out zoloft as it gave me diareahea when Itook it several years ago for panic attacks .The zoloft did stop the panic attacks,however. So Istarted on paxal for 3 months .felt somewhat better but slowed down or groggy.I decided the side effects were counter productive to what I needed in an antidepressant. Iasked to try wellbutrin. And felt the above mentioned benefits. I stared on the extended release then switched to generic and 2x a day dosing as the generic was much cheaper.I felt no difference between name brand and generic. Ihad no weight loss side effect.
4046	amoxil	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	infection (in ear)	the treatment cleared up the infection, mostly.  It cleared up the infection but I still felt that it was there for a while.  It did get rid of the pain in my ears from the infection really quickly, and the 'blocked up' feeling I had in my ear.	There were no side effects.	The infection was mostly cleared up.  For a few weeks I felt as though I still had a bit of an infection or it was coming back.  But after a while that went away.

None	I was taking benadryl prior to zyrtec. I found that benadryl was way too drowsy and zyrtec isn't. I take zyrtec in the morning and it alleviates my symptoms. My doctor said it was better to take it at night because it might cause drowsiness. I find it easier to take in the morning because I usually forget at night. I find it to be very effective in alleviating most symptoms.

1763	topamax	3	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	migraine	I first began taking Topamax when I was fifteen. I had severe migraines about five every week. When I started it did automatically begin helping me with the headaches, and then the side effects sat in very soon after. Yet, the weight loss side effect was the only positive. I lost twenty pounds.	Within twenty minutes of taking Topamax I began to get tingles in my feet and bad in my hands. The next two weeks when they had moved my doze from 50mg to 100mg I felt like a dud in class. I couldn't remember anything that I would have been able to grasp so much more quickly before. I would stumble on my words and get so confused. On top of all this, I was constantly in a bad mood and depressed. I finally said enough was enough the day I got over heated at the lake, I got over heated because Topamax doesn't let you sweat. Overall, the side effects over ruled the relief.	Above.

1972	lyrica	8	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	chronic pain	The treatment quieted the nerve endings givig them a chance to calm down from the chronic pain cycle.  It allowed the nervous system to regulate itself properly again.	"In the begining of treatment she was nauseas, dizzy, light headed, spacey, these symptoms decreased with time. She still gets what we call ""lyrica head"" on cloudy days.  ""Lyrica head"" is a foggy feeling.  Other patients taking lyrica that we have spoken to complain of this also."	She has suffered from chronic joint pain and several dilocated or sublaxed bones and joints through out her life.   About 18 months ago an orthopedic doctor treating her for another ligament injury looked at her history and saw a pattern and sent her to a geneticist who made a clinical diagnosis after doing some test.  She was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 3. She was then referred to the pain clinic to get some help with the increasing pain from her condition.  Their she met an anastheologist who prescribed Lyrica.  She was started on a low dose and increased gradually and after some trial and error settled on 100 mg 2xday.  The higher dose made her too spacey and light headed.
2772	duac	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Acne outbreaks healed quicker than using no medication.	At first my face was really red, dry, and flakey. After about 4 mos my face still gets red sometimes and is a little burny/itchy which it makes it hard to shave.	When I started using Duac (at bedtime) it made my face red, dry, and it peeled.  A great back-to-school look! I play outdoor sports and know I am suppose to wear suncreen but now all suncreens make my face burn(sting) more so I can't tolerate sunscreen.  The slight sunburn is actually less painful.  My acne seemed to heal the first 1-2 weeks and then it flaired up. It still flares but less frequently with less spots and heals faster.  Biggest problem is that it's like bleach on my navy pillowcase and I have ruined a lot of dark colored towels
3950	prilosec	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	gastric esophogeal reflux disease	I would have complete relief from acid reflux if I took the medication daily.  If I skipped a day, I would start to have severe gastric distress from acid reflux, would then have to take the Prilosec as well as an instant-acting Tums or Rolaids.	If I took the pill and also several Tums or rolaids, I would get diarrhea.	I worry about taking a pill for acid reflux because I read a study that says that this type of medication can also leach the calcium out of your system.  I am 49 and have a family history of osteoporosis so this concerns me.  I have been tested for osteoporosis and my bone density and strength is within normal limits.

1526	fluvoxamine	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insomnia	I have suffered from insomnia off and on for a number of years.   Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant and, as I didn't feel depressed, I was a little dubious initially.  My GP suggested I try it as I was unwilling to take any sedative-type pills.  After the initial start-up period (around two weeks) I found it made a big difference.  I now go to bed and sleep normally without any side effects such as drowsiness.  My GP suggested that I might have had a level of depression which was affecting my sleep, I don't know, although I do feel better generally as well as sleeping well.	In the first couple of weeks I felt a bit upset in my stomach, otherwise I was fine.	I took 100mg  Fluvoxamine about an hour before bed each night.  I continue to take it nightly.

Mild sinus headache at times depending on how bad my allergies were.	"This nasal spray helped me control my allergies and sinus problems for the time I was taking it, however as soon as I stopped taking it all of my symptoms came back immediately. I don't think this drug is a ""quick fix"" that you can use for a few days and then stop...I think it is something you have to take continuously to get the full benefits."

Slowed down my thought process, anxiety went done, not over thinking and less of a worrier.  No explosive episodes with family, stablized my moods.  Work non stop, focused on tasks, can sit and stay still, read books for longer then 5 minutes.  If you don't have ADHD and take this drug it will make you a hyperactive spaz and will have the oppositve effects.	Lack of sleep, this is why I was perscribed lunesta 3mg per night.

Weight loss, loss of appetite, headaches from not eating, shakey, mild dizzyness, blurred vision, forgetfulness, moody if I missed a dose or it wore off, can become addicting, temporary fix to a permanent problem.

Lived with bipolar, adhd and mild OCD my entire life.  Now that I have found out about all of my issues, I have been working with a good doctor who can ""fix me.""  I never been this clear headed and happy since I was a child.  Having these diseases without medication can ruin your life, your relationships, work, education, marriage etc.  I can only go from this day forward and I plan on making it the best life possible.  I will have to be on medication for the rest of my life."
3409	aricept	2	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	alzheimer's disease	We could not identify any benefits at all.  The behavior and memory problems remained unchanged or worsened over time.  Anxiety continued to increase and the dementia progressed systematically.  Disorientation continued to increase and the patient became more and more difficult to manage.  It appeared that irritability increased and the patient became more agitated more easily.	There was some indication that there was at least some increase nausa as well as some infrequent but increased bouts of diarrhea.  There were a few episodes of vomiting, but it might be attributed to other factors for this one side effect.  There was definitely increased insomnia as well as loss of appetite, but it can not be definitively stated that the drug alone contributed to these although it did occur after the drug was begun.	The patient was given a daily dose.  After transfer to a care facility, the regimentation in taking the dose was firmly set in place.  Staff medical personnel on site did not observe any benefits, and as a result, after about 6 months the prescription was terminated. During the time the drug was used, there was a patient review every other week to ascertain whether there seemed to be any improvement in the patient.  Memory tests were administered and one-on-one interviews were executed by medical personnel.  The results of the memory testing showed no net improvement nor was there any identifiable changes that might be considered positive.  Ultimately her psychiatrist in consultation with the family decided that the drug did not seem to provide any net gain.
532	trazodone	5	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	fibromyalgia	This medication greatly helped me to sleep well.  I felt more restored after a nights sleep.  I no longer had trouble going to sleep and no trouble with waking up in the middle of the night, and not being able to get back to sleep.  Unfortunately this medication did not seem to help with the Fibromyalgia very much.	It put a damper on my libido.  I wasn't much interested in having relations with my husband.  He was not too pleased with this.  I wasn't happy with this side effect either since it is not very good for a marital relationship.	I was to take this medication once a day.  At one time the dosage was increased to 50mg but with the decrease in my libido and too much grogginess in the morning my dosage was reduced to 25mg.  This seemed to do well in helping me to sleep better.
1442	tirosint	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	hypothyroid	Initially felt good, then after a week knee pain started.  Week later started getting bumps on my legs.  Kept thinking I was doing something else wrong, blamed it on new shoes, etc.  Knees hurt, were creaking and pain got worse. Bumps were scary.	Severe joint pain knees, sleeplessness, vaculitis.	Doctor said to discontinue.
1126	evista	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	osteopenia associated with menopause	The treatment benefits are long term.  There is no immediate benefit to be seen.  My doctor advised me that a follow-up dexa scan should be performed in two years to determine if the treatment is effective in reversing or at least arresting the osteopenia.  The drug is supposed to reduce risk of breast cancer.	I experienced some mild hot flashes during the month I took the drug.  These hot flashes were not of the intensity that I experienced when I first started to experience menopause.  I did have more ackiness in my bones and joints when I first starting taking it but these went away after the first few weeks.	"I was given one month's free sample of Evista by my doctor.  I took one 60 mg pill each morning with 600 mg Calcium with Vitamin D as directed by my doctor.  I also walk 30 minutes daily on my treadmill, again at my Dr.'s direction.  I refilled the presciption at a local discount ""member's only"" store and paid $106 for one month of the drug. I have since purchased the drug on line for about half the cost.  Once I receive it, I will resume taking the drug.  Looks like I'll have about a two week vacation.  Biggest concerns about taking this drug are blood clots and stroke.  You are not allowed to smoke and alcohol consumption needs to be kept to a low level because it's not good for the bones. Other lifestlye issues related to healthy bones are followed."

1961	lyrica	8	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	complex regional pain sydrome	With the Lyrica It helps the pain.	With Lyrica I have put on a bit of weight, this is rather depressing so now on anti depressants. For now I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome and the pains are not too good each day.	Lyrica is a good drug for pain in my hand/arm after an accident. If I dont take this drug my symptoms will only get worse. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome has changed my life, for I cant work anymore.
57	flexeril	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	headaches	I had morning-to-night headaches for two weeks prior to taking the medication. My doctor ascertained that these were most likely tension headaches. The morning after taking the first dose, I had no headache, and I remained headache-free for 2 days.  Now, on the third day, the headache is returning, so I plan to take another dose tonight.	All day on the day after taking the medication, I had symptoms that resembled low blood sugar.  I was very jittery after a small amount of caffeine (less than I normally drink).  All day I had this unpleasant effect.  But it was not as bad as having a headache all day.	Take 1 tablet at bedtime, if needed, for headache.
3990	fosamax	3	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	osteopenia in both hips and lower back	Slight increase in bone density in hips, however no change in back (vertabrae)	After taking the drug for 7 months, I literally developed severe gastric reflux one evening (June 2007).  Actual acid reflux disappeared within a few days, but symptoms feeling like a hard, sometimes painful lump in my esophagus persisted for months, especially when lying down.  Even after giving up Fosamax 2 months after initial symptoms occurred (in Sept '07, the condition persisted.	I was sent by my general practitioner for an endoscopy 3 months (Dec '07) after giving up Fosamax, results of which showed irritation of end of esophagus tube where it joins my stomach.  I was prescribed Nexium for the condition, and after taking for 3-4 months, the symptoms finally disappeared.  I would NEVER take Fosamax or any alendronate based or similar drug again.
248	wellbutrin-xl	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/anxiety	I presented with General Anxiety Disorder and Aggitated Depression.  I was unfocused, angry, anxious and had racing thoughts.  Wellbutrin XL helped with depression, unfocused thinking and racing thoughts.  I was more focused during the day and was able to complete tasks.  It also helped so that I would not fly off the handle and it helped me stay out of bed.  In a nutshell, it helped me with energy.  A main help was with the sexual side effects of Lexapro, a seratonin reuptake inhibitor.  Lexapro would dimish my libido and make it difficult to reach orgasm.  Wellbutrin really helped to conteract these side effects and gave me even energy during the day.	The only side effects from Wellbutrin is that sometimes I had difficulty getting to sleep if I took the dose later in the day (past noon).	The treatment includes Wellbutrin XL 300 mg.  This is a time released tablet and delivers medication during the day.  In addition, I would take Lexapro 5 to 10 mg for the aggitation and racing thoughts.  This was really helpful with anger and outbursts.  If I had trouble sleeping I would take Trazadone 10 mg at night, and if I did not have it I would take Simply Sleep or Tylenol PM, but only one tablet.  Sometimes I would cut the Trazadone in half for a 5 mg dose.  I have had low grade anxiety and depression for many years.  I have been menopausal for 4 years.  I have a lot of stress in my life with two teenage boys and we live in a high end community outside D.C. with cut throat competition on every corner.
170	zomig	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine	THe zomig nasal spray is generally very effective in curing migraine. 80% of the time the pain is 75% or more gone within an hour. Another 15% of the time it takes up to 2 hours.  5% of the time the pain is only lessen.  However lately some of the single dose units do not discharge the medication properly. Instead of a spray, you get a drop or two.  When this happens, the frequency of the pain not going away by at least 75% goes up. A couple of times it seemed virtually ineffective.  If the quality control doesn't improve, I may have to switch to a different Triptan.	Generally I fell a little dull or numb in the head, very slightly dizzy. Rarely there is a little tightness in the chest.	Since insurance only covers 2 per week and the doctor doesn't want me to take it too ofter for fear of rebound headaches, I generally wait until the headache is fairly bad and is interfering with my ability to work.  I will frequently take Tramadol, ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetophenamin earlier. These work maybe 25% of the time, or take the pain down enough so that I can avoid taking the tripan.
3440	tazorac	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	The treatmen was very effective as it helped keep pores clean due to exfoliation. the acne deminished after regular use for around 3 weeks, although it seemed to increase at first. This was expected according to directions.	the only side effects were a little irritability of the skin around the nose and eyes. Maybe because some product gets trapped in the deeper wirinkles in that area, so must be careful to distribute evenly.	I am very delighted with the medecine, to the point where I feel addicted to it and don't ever want to go without it again. My skin feels much smoother, with almost no blemishes, except duting PMS times. I also feel like I look younger and healthier due to renuwed skin.
2771	duac	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	decrease in frequency and severity of acne lesions. Blackheads were not as noticeable and pustules were much reduced in size and number.	Benzoyl peroxide is a strong bleaching agent and ruined many bathtowels and pajamas and bedsheets and pillowcases. During the wintertime, this treatment was mildly irritating to dry or sensitive skin. During the summertime, perspiration tended to cause this product to run off the target area and bleach clothing around the collar or neckline. Some mild dryness and scaling	At bedtime, wash face with mild cleanser. Apply duac gel (pea size), follow with anti-aging over-the-counter moisturizing cream. Wash again in the morning (or else the Duac will bleach clothing), follow with SPF 30 moisturizer, and makeup as needed. Acne lesions which are dry and crusty were treated with a dab of topical neosporin ointment to speed healing.
3921	nexium	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	gerd	After I started taking the medicine at the proper time of day, I no longer had to sit up to sleep. No longer have acid backup into my throat or throw up. As long as I didnt eat especially fatty or rich foods after 9 pm I was able to have a good sleep.	none	take one pill every morning, do not eat fatty foods or rich foods especially later in the day. Important to take the medicine early in the day, when I first started taking the medicine I wasnt told that and I didnt see much a change in the heartburn or other symptoms.After a couple months the doctor on a followup visit avised me to take them in the morning before I eat anything. That made a huge difference in how effective the drug was on my system.

"each night, after washing face and drying face, apply/dab a tiny amount and spread thinly on the entire face, avoiding the eye and the mouth area.  My cosmetic surgeon advised me that i could apply moisturizer or a night cream immediately after applying Tazorac on face at night.
Every morning, it is extremely important to avoid sun exposure so application of a facial product that contains spf of at least spf 15 is done to the face."

from use of Metrogel."	Dry skin.	"I was prescribed Metrogel for my moderate case of Rosacia. I took the prescription for almost
9 months. I applied a thin layer daily after washing my face in the evenings. After 9 months I
expected to see a slight difference in appearance of my skin, but did not. The only noticeable
affect I saw was how dry my skin became. And with it being a very expensive product, I 
was very disappointed."
3030	seroquel	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar disorder, hypomania.	None. I only took them for a couple of days, but had to stop because of the side-effects.	The biggest side-effect was that it made me experience shock-waves through my head and sometimes even my body, just like if someone would have turned on and off a lamp very quickly. That side-effect ended the same time I stopped taking Seroquel. The other one was that everything started to smell and taste very bad. It�s hard to explain exactly how, but it was a mix of vodka and mould. After I stopped taking the medication it took 2 weeks for the taste/smell-problem to disapear.	I was prescribed with Seroquel after I was released from hospital after a period of deep depression to help me to sleep better and stop me from becoming hypomanic.
1980	benadryl	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hives	At the onset of my condition of hives, I tried to avoid taking any medications and was hoping to ride it out.  By the second day, the itching got unbearable so I gave in and took Benadryl to counteract the severe itching I was having.  At this stage, the hives were in full swing so the medication was only 50% effective but it helped enough for me to resist scratching myself.  As time went by, the itching slowly subsided and the hives went away (lasted about five days).	When I first took Benadryl, I took two tablets (50 mg) on an empty stomach.  The medication left me nauseated and lethargic.	After the initial dosage taken (described above), I reduced the dosage to just one tablet (25 mg) but I increased the frequency to one tablet every two hours.  I figured this would be equivalent to the recommended directions of 2 tablets every 4 hours but I spread the tablets out to keep the effects of the medication fresh.  I also learned not to take this medication on an empty stomach.  It worked since I did not suffer any nausea, drowsiness, dry mouth, or upset stomach.
779	naproxen	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	musculoskeletal pain; nerve pain	Very effective reduction in pain from an injury, and later when having vulvar vestibulitis flare ups.	When I took it twice a day for a week for an injury, my stomach got upset.  Taking one 500mg dose daily just a few days a week I only notice a very subtle spaciness, but I'm very drug sensitive.	500mg twice a day for injuries....then 500mg here and there for spot pain reduction.  I used after deep physical therapy work that may make my pain worse - seemed pretty effective.
1958	lyrica	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	fibromyalgia	Muscle pain from fibromyalgia was reduced; able to more actively participate in life activities.	fatigue, decreased mental acuity, weight gain.	Once I started taking Lyrica, it took a couple of weeks to gain full advantage of its benefits. Originally, I has been places on a dose of 200mg three times a day, which I believe what was recommended for fibromyalgia. The resultant relief of pain was pretty good. However, I found myself very tired and mentally dull. I switched doctors and was given the reduced dosage of 75mg. twice a day. Although my pain relief results have not been as good, I do still have some relief while at the same time being able to be more alert and functional.

Finally am back on Armour 1 gram or .60mcg per day.  I feel like a new person in just 5 days.  More energy, more positive, sugar cravings stopped. Over all feel 100% better.  As far as I am concerned that Dr. took 6 years out of my life. New Female Dr. finally put me back on Armour.  It was unavailable for almost a year. I think it was all about money.

Nodules grew back and did not feel like my self. Back on Armour for just 5 days and feel so much better. INSIST ON GETTING ARMOUR. FORGET LEVOXYL AND SYTHROID. THOSE DRUGS DID NOT WORK FOR ME."

I also felt more like my ""normal"" old self!!"	drowsiness but couldn't stay asleep, weird dreams that jolted me awake, jitters, day drowsiness, weakness/tingling in extremeties, zombie like at times due to the drowsiness.I also felt I had a cloudy mind at times.	Given for depression as a sample.  began with 30 mg but due to the side effects the dr. decreased it to half a capsule sprinkled on food.  was still too strong.  didn't feel as good as far as my moods/depression go, and still felt the jitters.  Didn't feel as drowsy. I suspect that I could tolerate this medication after the side effects subsided or decreased after a few weeks, but because I work I couldn't wait...I would have been jittery and yet like a zombie for work and that was not an option

This drug should be used as needed e.g taken to stop being crazy, and then stopped once patient has returned to normal state NOT any longer!

I was basicly druged up to the eye balls an lost almost a year of my life."
3274	zoloft	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	This drug literally changed my life and I wish I had started taking it earlier in life.  So many problems would have been solved for me. I was never happy, cryed often and had no self worth at all.  I was also very anxious and uncomfortable around people and avoided many social situations because of this.  In short I was not enjoying anything at all about life or work!  When I started taking Zoloft (under my doctor' care) it was like a miracle for me.  I went back to school!  I pursued a new career (my old job was nothing other than a hiding place for me) I blossomed!  I honestly do not know if this drug has the same effect on everyone but I recommend trying it. I should be the poster child for Zoloft.  I am still taking it and may be for the rest of my life.  As for people who complain about anti-depressants, there is only one thing to say to them, They obviously have never known the debilitating effects of depression!	No libido	I started taking 50 mg. of Zoloft for about a month while my doctor monitored me.  And then he gradually increased the dosage.
1372	biaxin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	borreliosis	The treatment benefit of the pharmaceutical drug named Biaxin included assistance with the eradication of the cell wall deficient bacteria named Borrelia Burgdorferi. In combination with the Flagyl, which breaks down the biofilm that the Borrelia bacteria protect themselves from hostile environments including exposure to antibiotics, the Biaxin can kill the bacteria when they emerge from their biofilms which is weakened by Flagyl.	I only experienced one side effect from this medication which I will mention as follows. The side effect that experienced throughout the course of treatment was the persuasive bitter taste in the mouth. Other than that single side effect I did not experience any other side effects that I am aware of.	The treatment details using the combination of Biaxin and Flagyl together was to assist in the eradication of the cell wall deficient bacteria called Borrelia Burgdorferi. The Flagyl was prescribed to be taken in a five hundred milligram dose twice a day with food as was the same for Biaxin.

The drug prevents elevated IOP (intraocular pressure) the higher the IOP, the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage, which can lead to vision loss and potential blindness.
3993	fosamax	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	osteoporosis	osteoporosis stabilized in hip and osteopoenia stabilized in back	none known.    Always taken with a full glass of water and nothing else was consumed for a least 30 min.  There were no digestive problems even though I had long standing reflux.  I was also told to take a pepcid AC the night before to reduce acid reflux and increase absorption of the fosamax.  I think the Pepcid AC may have helped.	91.37 mg alendronate sodium taken once weekly with a full glass of water stabilized bone density, but did not increase bone density over a three year period.
2763	risperdal-consta	5	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	hallucinations	Risperdal reduces worry about visual and auditory hallucinations that remain.  Personality remains intact.  Disturbing thoughts are reduced.	Significant weight gain, weak muscles, fogginess, nightmares, sleepwalking and loss of appreciation for humor.	She sees people and hears music that others do not see or hear, therefore takes risperdal when symptoms are too difficult to manage to be a competent spouse, parent and professional.  Talk therapy combined with medication monitoring supported by Risperdal each night helped to improve self confidence and reduce paranoia.
503	paxil-cr	9	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	completely ended panic attacks,most sweating,most blushing,much discomfort.	more anxiety at first for about 3 weeks. some headaches,nausea	I started the medicine 8-10 years ago and took the medicine religously to begin with. Took about 4 weeks to really make a difference. However, did notice change after only a couple weeks. I slack off many times and after a day or two of missed pills I notice dizziness and mild headache plus some nausea. Not good to do, but it happens. After being on the medicine as many years as I have, I don't think it is as effective as others may be, but I have tried many...Prozac,Zoloft and numerous others I don't remember the name of and nothing worked as well for me as Paxil..Another note is that anxiety runs in my family and a few aunts and uncles in my family have had the same good luck with Paxil. I often wonder since we are related if it treats something in our brain the same as it seems to work for this family??? Something to think about if you know someone else in your family that suffers from depression or other mental illness.
2513	motrin	1	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	flu	significant reduction of pain due to the flu virus.  this is a typical prescription for the flu, pain killers with lots of fluids.  I was drawn to this tablets because they look appealing, the red capsules are easy to take and the caplets are coated in sugar. Normally I'd take paracetamol, which are dry and hard to swallow, I choose these to be kind to myself !!!  I had no idea they could cause this reaction. they were good pain killers.	asthmatic condition.  Heavy chest, dry cough, weakness, cumulative effect over days.  Still prone to shortness of breath and tightness and heavy chest feelings, very sensitive to sulphides in wine and vinegars etc, was not before this. I only became aware of this connection when I took some I had left for  a period pain, once again within seconds I was really ill.	"Not sure what this section requires ? It's a straight forward case of pain relief in response to the flu virus.  the symptoms and the side effects became inter-twined, so it was not apparent that this drug was causing a reaction and worse than that I continued taking it as I became more and more ill.  This is an over the counter drug, I would have appreciated more information from my pharmacist.  I have tried to tell as many people as possible about what happened. After I have stopped taking the treatment I am left with a susceptibility to asthmatic type symptoms, it was also scary as I instinctively knew I was getting worse and became concerned something very serious was going on. I have never experience that type of ""illness"" before, normally I take time out and get well... this was an eye-opener."
3164	prednisone	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	polymorphous light eruption (pmle)	The use of Prednisone before and during my vacation prevented the occurrence of the rash that I used to get due to sun exposure.  One year it did not totally prevent the rash and so the following year we increased the dosage.	None	I get Polymorphous Light Eruption (PMLE) each year when I go to Cancun on vacation in March.  It is a very painful, itchy rash (appears like a heat rash) which I get reagardless of sunblock usage.  This is apparently a fairly common condition in women of fair complexion (like me) who go to very sunny areas after a long period of no sun exposure.  It began happening when I was in my 20's and it took several years (and the Internet as well as a dermatologist) to diagnose what was happening.  Since then, the use of Predisone (beginning 4 days before my vacation and slowly decreasing the dosage over a period of 8 days) has prevented the rash and mad my vacations a success!

2024	protonix	8	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	gerd	Relief of chronic nausea, indigestion, acidic feeling in throat	None - this is the last in a series of similar drugs that I tried and discontinued because of a variety of side effects. Protonix seems to be the one that I can tolerate. But I still occasionally get the bloat/overstuffed feeling.	Not sure what this means - I take a single dose in the AM and try to avoid trigger foods/beverages like chocolate and caffeine.

1342	lybrel	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	no more monthly periods	no more monthly periods	slight spotting for more than 7 days each cycle	Since Nov 2007 I have been taking Lybrel to avoid my period. According to the manufacturer it is normal to have spotting for the first 6-12 month. I had many days of spotting until this July- so for 8 month. Since this August I had no more bleeding.

I noticed that my allergy symptoms improved quickly. I could reduce my asthma inhalants as well, since it was improving with the reduction of my allergy symptoms.

4128	chantix	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	smoking cessation	It did curb my desire to smoke.  I went from smoking a pack a day after years of smoking to smoking one cigarette a day without using any nicotine substitutes.  However, I never got to the point where I didn't have the one cigarette a day and the side effects were so severe that I had to stop taking the drug.	The worst were the terrible nausea, gas and abdominal distress.  I would be so nauseous after taking the drug that I would have to lie down for about forty five minutes before I could function.  Also, as the treatment wore on, the gas pains became so painful that I just had to stop taking the drug.  The gas pains grew more severe over time.	I took the drug as prescribed but as noted above was not successful at quitting smoking.
955	diovan	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	high blood pressure	Marginally lowered my blood pressure.	After day three, I noticed a burning sensation with both feet. After week two, pain arrived in both feet, with swelling and joint pain. Stopped medication after week 3. Went to a neurologist for 2 hrs. of neurologic testing of my nerves. Peripheral neuropathy was the diagnosis. I have been fighting the pain and burning in my feet with no reversal for about a year now.	I refused the drug treatments suggested by my neurologist. The potential side effects were just to much for my taste. As a Pharmacist, I've opted for 2 different treatments. One is a product called Solleve, which are vibrating insoles for your shoes. I have found some relief as well as reversal of my condition after 2 weeks of treatment. I also put myself on a daily specific vitamin regimen. I am also going to add a product called the ReBuilder to my therapy.
665	erythromycin	3	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Treatment was for cystic acne. The dermatologist prescribed erythomyicin for treatment. Saw the dermatologist biweekly and the dermatologist would give me a check over. The dermatologist then would ask if I was doing anything different, and then would proceed to give me a new prescription for the erythromycin.	The erthyromycin was prescribed for cystic acne. The erthyromycin is an orally administrated drug for the treatment of bacterial infections. Gastrointestinal disturbances, such as diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting, are fairly common.  Although I did not have any vomiting reactions the other disturbances did occur. The treatment with the erthyromycin did not relieve the cystic acne. I was taking the erythromycin three times a day for almost one year and there were no noticeable results.	The dermatologist would see me every other week for and check my cystic acne. The medical tech. person would first check me and ask questions regarding any changes in what I was doing and how the medication was working and if there were any side effects.  The dermatologist would then come into the room and check my cystic acne. The dermatologist would then ask if I was doing anything different and then would ask if I was taking my medication and ask if I was on any other medications.  He wouild ask if there were any bad side effects to the medication and then would give me another prescription for another round of medication treatment. This would go on for about one year of visits and prescriptions.  There was not any change in the cystic acne of any great degree.
4077	mobic	1	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	back pain	Helped the pain enormously, after many other treatments failed.	After almost three months on meloxicam, suddenly, without any previous gastro-intestinal problems, I developed an intestinal perforation requiring emergency surgery.  I was hospitalized for 6 days afterward on IV antibiotics.  Since no other cause for the perforation was found, it was assumed it was caused by the medication.	I took meloxicam once a day with food for almost three months.
1732	topamax	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine prevention	Went from approx. 17 migraine days a month to approx. 4 migraine days a month while taking topamax and erinn.  (Before adding erinn, was down to approx. 8 migraine days a month.)  Topamax seemed to greatly lessen the hypersensitivity of my brain to overreact to triggers such as changes in altitude, barometric pressures, humidity levels, environmental triggers such as smoke, strong smells, loud noises, and food triggers such as dark chocolate.  Before topamax all of these things would cause migraines to start very easily.  After settling in on topamax these things didn't bother me like they used to.	"When first starting the drug, diet soda tasted metallic and downright horrible.  There was definitely an adjustment period of getting used to the drug and increasing the dosage in small increments was important.  I could feel changes in my brain that are hard to describe.  Almost like the top was a little bit ""lifted"".  It was worth getting through this period for the results, though.  They definitely went away as my body got accustomed to the drug.  Once that happened, the migraines lessened and one pleasant side effect was that I didn't snack as often.  No ""mindless munching.""  I lost some weight without trying.  I felt that it was difficult to retrieve thoughts or find the right word at times.  I found it would take a few seconds longer to put my thoughts into words.  Felt a little ""spacey.""  As I mentioned before, I got through it after getting used to the drug.  It took several weeks but after having 17 migraine days a month and going down to 8 it was worth it."	Started at 25mg 2x a day for several days and started titrating up by adding 25mg to the evening dose every 3-4 days, depending on how I felt.  Got up to 100 mg. a day for the first year.  After moving and talking to my new doctor, she suggested increasing the dose to see if I could have less migraines than the 10-12 I was having so I titrated up to 200mg a day and my migraines went down to 8 a month.
739	flonase	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	Thought to have allergies - not the case however FloNase works to clear the sinuses and prevent infections, works wonderfully!!	None at all.	After years of trying drugs to relieve what appeared to be allergies and sinus problems, a test was done on the pressure in the ear itself revealing defective Eustachean Tubes. FloNase was prescribed along with Claritin D (as needed) to keep any symptoms away as well as prevent patient's constant symptoms and painful infections.
352	neurontin	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	cervical spondylitis	The neurontin slightly helped pain but not enough to contine the drug. it was supposed to help muscle spasms but did not.  I would not increase because of the side effects.	Made me feel like a zombie, extremly dizzy, nause and major weight gain very quickly without eating any more	Took 300 mg three times daily, doctor wanted to increase but side effects too severe.  I could barely function on what was prescribed.
2394	synthroid	5	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	My hair grew back (prior to treatment it was falling out in clumps) and my depression, weight gain, and exhaustion improved somewhat.	I experienced no discernible side effects.	"Although this drug did alleviate my hair loss it only lessened my depression,  exhaustion, and weight gain. I still have difficulty with concentration and memory and experience ""brain fog"" every day. My endocrinologist says my dose is perfect based on my blood test results but my symptoms persist."
1768	citalopram	4	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	antianxiety/depression	There weren't any significant benefits.	"I felt groggy, sick to my stomach and had a general ""heavy"" feeling all of the time. Also gave me a mild headache"	Only required to take it once a day with meals
966	sarafem	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	pmdd	Not so emotional a week before and during my menstrual cycle. Relieved thoughts of suicide as well as given me more energy through that rough patch of my PMS cycle. Feelings have also calmed down with my loved ones. As I can be more relaxed as my anxiety level feels like it's at it's all time low.	I can only sleep a couple of hours a night while taking the pill. A day after the last pill is taken, I have a headache for about a couple of days.	Two weeks out of the month I take 20 mg, every morning. I start on a Sunday a week before my menstrual cycle. Finish up the months' treatment 14 days later. ( which ends on a Saturday )
1632	premarin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	menopause	"I started taking Premarin after having a complete hysterectomy for ovarian cancer. f
At first, it took about a week to start feeling any effects on the severe hot flashes that I was feeling after being put into instant menopause. But gradually the dug started working and now my hot flashes and mood swings are practically non-existent."	None.	I started receiving Premarin 0.9 mg immediately after a complete hysterectomy. After it became effective, I was reduced to a dosage of 0.625 mg and it works just fine.
1244	sotret	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	mild but resistant acne	Treatment was very effective, effects started to be noticeable after 3 weeks. After 3 months skin had cleared and as additional benefits, hair and skin were much less oily (no longer needed to wash hair daily as it was not so oily any more. Pores shrunk and much less visible.	"Side effects started about 3 days after starting treatment. Initially lips became very dry and had to use lip salve continuosly. Then I started getting nosebleeds as the skin inside my nose became very dry and fragile.
Skin became very dry and sensitive during treatment and eyes very sensitive to light.
I had to have regular blood tests to check my lipid profile but it was not affected by the treatment.
During the second course of treatment I also got very mild depression symptoms so I stopped the treatment."	"I suffered with mild acne and many whiteheads that were resistant to all other topical and antibiotic treatment. My dermatologist was reluctant to prescribe Accutane as I had a mild acne but eventually let me try a course at the lowest dose (0.5/mg/kg). I had 2 courses of treatment with Accutane. The first time it was highly effective (side effects were tolerable and worth it as I got great results) so I stopped after 4 months. after about a year the acne returned (much less than previously) so I took another course and after that it was definitely gone. 
There are side effects but if you can tolerate them, it is a very effective treatment.
I had to do a pregnancy test prior to starting each course and full blood test and had to take oral contraceptives throughout the treatment as there is a risk of birth defects. I also had to see dermatologist every 2 weeks initially then monthly and have my blood tests repeated.
Tretment was very expensive (including cost of drugs, blood tests, consultation fees) but worth it."
3320	dilantin	2	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	anticonvulsant	none, I was unable to take  the drug to achieve the benefits as I had a reaction.	My first impression was of an over all dizzy feeling, with a full body red raised rash which appeared in 3 days.	Had to discontinue using, took almost 2 weeks for the rash to finally dissipate.
452	xyzal	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	seasonal allergies	I did not see any significant benefits for treating the histamine reaction- which was due to a bug bite and subsequent allergic response.  Sensations and symptoms included inflammation, redness, swelling to the point of limited mobility (bite was on hand) and itching, which the Xyzal did not effectively treat; however, the xyzal appeared to help with the seasonal allergies related to hay fever.  For the topical condition, diphenhydramine was preferred.	Drowsiness.  Slight dizziness, but not remarkable.  I also thought that the drug's slow-release effect may not be as modulated as one would hope since the drowsiness and related symptoms came in spurts rather than in a constant flow, if you know what i mean.  I did not find that caffeine was helpful to promote alertness and I was nervous about driving while taking this particular medication.	"I took the every evening every 24 hours for 14 days, according to my doctor's instructions.  He did not want me to ""mix antihistamines"" and even though I thought Benadryl might be more effective, I didn't want a drug that would make me that sleepy and also that I would have to take every 6 hours, as opposed to every 24 hours.  I would have prefferred a Xyzal dose that i could take every 12 hours, and then i could use benadryl at night without worrying about mixing anti-histamines, but since this was not possible I just used the Xyzal plus topical antihistamine creme on site of bug bite."
2672	prinivil	3	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	?

4154	klaron	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	skin problem	Reduced bad boils and acne on the skin surface	Drying of the skin, some redness and some skin irritation	This lotion was applied to cleansed skin topically twice a day for a period of one year.  The result was the drying of and reduction of very bad acne and skin boil breakouts with the side effect of red, dried and slightly sensitive skin.  This was reduced by using a non allergenic topical skin moisturizer which alleviated the side effects
2821	wellbutrin	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	bipolar disorder ii	I had a nervous breakdown suddenly and unexpectedly.  After 1 week in the psych ward, I was prescribed 2 medications that I soon realized didn't help.  Over the course of 1 year, I tried many different combinations of anti-depresants which didn't work.  Not until I tried both wellbutrin and topomax together did I start recovering from my breakdown.  About 1 1/2 years ago I discontinued the Topomax and I've only used the Wellbutrin since it helps me maintain my health.	I didn't experience any side effects.	See above as that thoroughly explains everything.
3106	ortho-tri-cyclen	3	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pregnancy prevention	"It was completely effective against pregnancy.
One other good effect was my periods became very regular."	"Too many bad side effects made this drug intolerable. Here is the list:
(1) severe mood swings, ranging from depression to hyperactive and happy states; 
(2) my appetite increased to a point where I was overeating; 
(3) my breasts were often sore/painful; 
(4) I had nightly dreams (nightmares) and had difficulty sleeping; 
(5) It did not clear my skin of pimples like my doctor said it would..."	"One active tablet administered daily from the 1st day through the 21st day of the menstrual cycle, counting the first day of menstrual flow as ""Day 1"" followed by one green inactive tablet daily for 7 days. Tablets are taken without interruption for 28 days. After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started the next day.

1583	xanax	4	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety	First days after surgery were a blur.  There was considerable swelling post surgery, and the drug helped me to ignore the way I looked.

I wish I would have discovered this sooner.  But later is better than never, I am very grateful this drug exists.  It is not an amphetamine (which is good because I could get addicted to speed too easily), this does not amp me up, it makes me calm and inspired and focused, a HUGE change in my life.  I am actually enjoying being alive (which is saying a lot compared to where I was at before taking Ritalin)	absolutely none.

They say no more than 60mg. a day but I am happy with 30mg for now.
2625	depo-provera	4	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	contraception	It was 100% effectiv as contraception, the mayor benefit is not having to rememeber to take the pill every day and that it has only one form of hormon, which is important for woman over 35, especially smokers.	The side effects were like a prevision of menopause - huge weight gain (20 pounds), incredible mood swings and severe bloating. My overall feeling was quite depressed and it took me a while to figure out that it had to do with the drug, not with what was going on in my personal life. I also thought that the weight gain was partially retlated to quiting smking.	One shot in the upper arm every three months, that's it!

2042	noritate	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	rash under nasal area	I had the drug initally offered to me by my dermatologist in sample tube years ago.  I found it very effective, despite only dabbing on the smallest amount due to only having small sample tube.  Yet despite quick clear-ups...I would occasionally have recurrances under my nose with the rash.  I have struggled with this rash for over 20 years.  With the last outbreak, while having minimal amounts left in the sample tube, I went in to my dermatologist and got a full prescription in about June of 2009.  Not only was I able to use a bit more in application this time, but it obviously was not an expired product.  I found the long-term rash hsf completely cleared up within less than a week.  While this was not new to me with this product, the fact that I have had no recurrance whatsoever in over four months is the great news.	Absolutely none	After washing my face with my long-term personal choice of face wash (Alpha Hydrox foaming face wash) and using a Strident sensitive skin cleaning pad, I would apply the Noritate cream sparingly over the rash under my nose at night.  (Note:  I did not use the tetracycline during this time, as I knew it was not an acne-related outbreak.)
589	acyclovir	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	herpes	During the ten years I've been taking acyclovir, I have experienced zero outbreaks, compared to almost continuous outbreaks prior to taking this drug. I occasionally have the achiness that precedes an outbreak, and have on two or three occasions taken an extra dose per day when I experience that symptom.	I have experienced no noticeable side effects during this ten year period on acyclovir.	I have no special treatment details except taking recommended dose on time and not skipping doses.
672	zantac	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	excess acidity	relief from burning associated with reflux	slight nausea during the first 24 hours.	Part of my treatment plan was to undergo an endoscopy to find out what the problem was initially.  The doctor who performed the endoscopy prescribed the Zantac.  In the first 24 hour period I felt no differently, but the second day I started to feel alot better.  At the end of the two weeks period of taking 2x tabs per day I felt completely back to normal.  I ceased taking the Zantac after my follow up visit with the doctor but was advised to keep some handy for future use.
3249	nuvaring	4	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	birth control	No Mood Swings, Easy Birth Control Method..It was very convenient not having to take a pill everyday.	I had at least 10 yeast infections while using the Nuvaring. I had never had a yeast infection before, nor have I ever had problems getting rid of a yeast infection.   I believe the ring was the culprit.	I went to my doctor to complain about the yeast infections.  It seemed like every time I inserted a new NuvaRing, I got a yeast infection.  She told me to use Monistat, and see if that works.  It worked for a week, but then I developed another yeast infection.   I went back to my doctor/gyno.  She prescribed me Diflucan, an antifungal pill taken by mouth.  I was to take 1 pill every time I started a new ring.  I still had yeast infections.  My doctor then advised me to take the Diflucan every other day for 3 days after starting a new ring.  No improvement.   She then prescribed me a vaginal cream containing steroids and an  anti-inflammatory.   I gave up -  the next time I went to the doctor, I had her prescribe me a new birth control.  I'm back on the pill, Loeastrin24FE.  Haven't had a yeast infection since the switch off the nuvaring.
2147	zyrtec	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	allergies	When I took Zyrtec on a daily basis, my allergy symptoms were reduced.  I didn't appear to have the headaches (band around my head) as often nor did I have the pain in the ears associated with this band quite so frequently, my nose was not quite so 'runny' or itchy.  I found my nose clearer during the daytime and I had less 'sniffles' as compared to days when I did not take the Zyrtec at all.  Overall, it improved my symptoms notably.	If I took my Zyrtec in the a.m., then by mid-afternoon I could not function.  Drowziness, brain-fog, fatigue.  If I took Zyrtec at dinner-time it appeared not to affect me.  If I forgot and did not take it until bed-time, then the next morning I could 'not wake up'.  Severe tiredness.	I discovered that I had to take the Zyrtec at dinner-time.  If I forgot and knew I had a busy day or early appointments/meetings, I must skip that day's dosage.  If I don't take it continuously, it is nowhere near as affective.
914	paxil	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety and depression	Extremely effective in reducing anxiety and depression. Makes you less self-conscious and able to go outside for walks, pass crowded patios without having to cross over to the other side of the street because you are affraid of being watched. Highly effective in reducing irritability and increasing patience. A lot less side effects than other anti-depressants. You do not feel drowsy or drugged. Neither do you get any stomach upsets.	Only side effect is that it is highly addictive. Was very hard to get off the treatment even when going down 1 mg per 2 weeks. Used the liquid for that. Could go cold turkey with all other anti-depressants but not this one. Once I went from 20 m/g per day to 15 m/g per day had to return back to initial starting dosage because my body went into extreme withdrawal.	Extremely effective in reducing anxiety and depression. Makes you less self-conscious and able to go outside for walks, pass crowded patios without having to cross over to the other side of the street because you are affraid of being watched. Highly effective in reducing irritability and increasing patience. A lot less side effects than other anti-depressants. You do not feel drowsy or drugged. Neither do you get any stomach upsets.
1433	tirosint	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	hypothyroid, hashimoto	I felt ok for about two days when first starting the treatment, then the lovely side effects began to set in	hives, insomnia, cough, ANGINA	I suggest to anyone who doesn't think that these synthetic drugs are really curing their sympoms, go online and research dessiccated thyroid, like Armour.  stopthethyroidmadness.com
4020	celexa	1	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	depression	I took Celexa for approximately 6 months and I found it to be totally ineffective. This was not surprising considering I have taken several other psychotropic (SSRI's) drugs, with the same ineffectiveness. I'm finally thinking mabye I don't have a serotonin deficiency, and mabye there are other issues. Going back to dr. to see if there may be another course of action.	sexual side effects, yawning, dry mouth	40mg. daily for 6 months.
2556	ziana	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	There has been a noticeable reduction in acne. Overall my skin is much smoother. I have sensitive skin and rosacea. It has not exasperated my rosacea like other tretinoin treatments have. I have been very happy with it. It's the best drug I've used for acne so far.	My sensitive skin, will still peel regardless but especially if irritated by winter dryness or rubbing against my partner's beard. I have peeled with every tretinoin product I've tried and this is the least bothersome. I am also more sensitive to the sun. Unlike other drugs, I have not ever cracked or felt discomfort unless I get excesssive sun or dryness. I don't use it every day in the winter.	I spread this on my entire face every night on clean skin. In the winter, I follow with a moisturizer. In the morning, I use metrogel daily. When I have more of a breakout - and it's hard for me to sometimes differentiate acne from rosacea - I will also take Oracea for a week. If I know that I will be spending quite a bit of time outside then I will take a break from it.
2577	klonopin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety/panic attacks/	About two years ago Lexapro had totally stopped working and I was trying many different drugs from pristiq, welbutrin, cymbalta, none of which worked. After a few days on welbutrin I experienced the worst panic attack ever. I thought the end was near. I had had them in the past, but nothing like this. It probably lasted only about 5 minutes but seemed an eternity. The rest of that particular day I was completely exhausted. That was a Sunday and the following day my family doctor stopped all my meds and switched me over to clonazepam and zoloft. It's been a year now and I haven't felt this well in a long time. Minimal side effects.	Maybe a little bit of drowsiness from time to time, but other than that nothing else.	Just visit the doctor from time to time and take klonopin twice a day and my 200 mgs of zoloft once a day.
3328	tetracycline	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	acne-i was 22 yrs old when i took it	I started with headaches on the 9th day of taking the medication. I eventually needed 2 yrs of spinal taps to reduce the fluid build on in my spinal cord which was putty pressure on my brain.	none see above	The Doctors told me this is a very rare side effect but it ruined my life for over two years.
2601	ortho-tri-cyclen-lo	2	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	heavy menstrual bleeding	None... did not make my periods any lighter	Weight gain... I gained 10-15 pounds while on the pill and because I'm only 4'10, that 10-15 pounds REALLY SHOWS. I've tried other oral contraceptives for my heavy menstrual bleeding and all of them do the same thing... they don't help regulate my menstrual bleeding but they do make me gain weight. In the future, when I need to use a method of birth control, I will not be using oral contraceptives... EVER!	My sister is also on this pill (for birth control) and she has experienced many side affects from it, too.
3097	triphasil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	birth control	prevented unwanted pregnancy.  Regular menstrual cycles.	None for me.	I have friends who hated their birth control pills -- their pills made them feel bloated and fat.  I had none of those side effects while on TriPhasil/Trivora.  It's really simple -- just take one a day -- and pretty effective.  It worked for me for more than 10 years.  A bonus:  my menstrual cycles, which used to be somewhat irregular, became as predictable as clockwork.
4014	celexa	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety/depression	I felt like I could handle my work and relationship stress better.	I had strange bruises all over my legs and arms.  I lost my libido as well as not caring much about anything.  I felt like I had no emotion.	I flushed them down the toilet after awhile because I wanted to have my personality back.
39	zyprexa	5	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	psychosis	stopped paranoid delusions	excessive sedation and excessive weight gain	"patient was prescribed Zyprexa at Providence Hospital Emergency care by telephone consult with psychiatrist to delay and/or prevent in-patient hospitalization.
Side effects, especially sedation were evident immediately after coming home.
Returned to emergency, tranferred to in-patient care, two weeks, to observe medication with therapy. Switched to Abilify."
1775	citalopram	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression/bipolar affective component	Gradual improvement of mood.  Reasonable results over the years, but not stable.  Too afraid to try others.	Clenching - jaw, legs, arms, shoulder therefore pain in muscles, also very painful hips after sitting for any length of time, driving etc.  Clenching has been getting worse over last 12 months.  Sodium Valproate augments effect of Citalopram, so currently decreasing Sodium Valproate to see if it makes any difference.	Citalopram 40mg to start with but too many side effects.  Reduced to 20mg, less side effects, worked okay on mood..except I was swinging.  Introduced Sodium Valproate, gradually increased it to 1g BD (twice day), has worked quite well up until recently where side effect profile is interferring with my life.
2053	prempro	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	menopause	reduced severity of hot flashes, decreased vaginal dryness	increase in migraines	Daily use of drug was generally effective in reducing severity of hot flashes, but at 1.5 mg I still had them.  However, I didn't want to increase the possibility of more severe side effects, so I was willing to put up with some discomfort.  I am concerned about continuing to take it for years.
1283	provigil	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	narcolepcy	Able to function and have a productive life. If I am very tired the medication is not effective.	headache for the 1st week. Slight nausea on days I do not eat regular Small meals.	Tried Aderol, once a day 5mg, for 3 weeeks . I had hallucinations and although awake, was very out of control.
1994	vicodin	1	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	root canal pain	Little, if any.	minimal pain relief, dramatic sense of disassociation from the pain, agitation.	"I found that Vicodin was a poor choice for real pain management. I felt spacey and ""out of it"" but at the same time agitated.  I didn't feel an actual absence of pain as much as I felt ""oh well, gee gosh, I have pain.  Isn't that a bummer.""  In other words, the medication seemed to be more about changing my attitude towards the pain rather then actual reduction of pain.  I subsequently
stopped taking it and turned to tylenol with codeine.  This worked much better in my opinion.  I subsequently refused any additional prescriptions for vicodin and requested tylenol with codeine instead.  I have since switched to a natural pain relief option that is a combination of white willow, feverfew, skullcap, and kelp.  It is called ""Relief"".  I believe the manufacturer is ""Nature's Way.""  Although, I am in daily pain for assorted issues (structural) I avoid medicating myself unless it is particularly dibilitating.  If I really need to take something I will take the Relief or plain Aspirin.  Dramatically fewer side effects, no hazard of addiction, just as effective.  Given the high level of reported addictiveness of this drug, I would never take it again nor recommend anyone else take it."

902	paxil	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	lower blood pressure	In the beginning headaches, now my blood pressure is much lower and I don't spend most of the day running to the bathroom like I took a diuretic.	When I started taking paxil, I was severely depressed.  When I woke up in the morning, I would sit on the side of the bed for around 30 minutes before I could finally get up and start getting ready for work and then I would still cry until around 12 noon.  After taking paxil for about 3 days, I had a job as a courier and I caught myself singing and dancing to a song on the radio.  I couldn't believe it, I had not done that for about 5 months.  Also there was the great side effect of appetite loss, especially at first, where I had actually forgotten to eat all day on several occasions.  I still take paxil today, and I my emotional state is more balanced. I am also happy with the amlodopine.
1385	biaxin	2	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	upper respiratory infection	Started feeling better very quickly.	"This is some nasty shiznit.  After two days, I began to experience a horrible, disgusting taste in my mouth that made everything I tried to eat taste awful (in a sour, metallic sort of way).  I could even ""smell"" the taste.  It made me want to hurl.  I also developed a rash on my back, neck and face. I stopped taking it.  Honestly, the  sinus infection is less unpleasant than its cure."	It did clear up the congestion very quickly.
1839	yasmin	3	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control	My skin was flawless and I had a very youthful glow. My acne went away completely. My breasts were much fuller and my body looked more curvy and feminine, even though I worked out daily and didn't change my eating habits.	The most negative side effect was the mood alteration. I became a completely different person. Very depressed and crying all the time for no reason. It was very very strange. Not like me at all. My mood would change constantly like a yo-yo. Also, I gained weight and felt like I was retaining water. A week before my period I would feel weak and feverish.	My OBGYN explained that this oral contraceptive uses a synthetic progestin known as drospirenone. He suggested that it might be the cause of my negative side effects. He also said that it was more appropriate for women in their mid-30's or those who have experienced adverse effects from other oral contraceptives. He switched me to ortho tri cyclen-lo and I haven't had any problems whatsoever. I also don't have the benefits either.
829	zegerid	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	gerd	It initially worked great to eliminate my heart burn.  But it is now requiring 2 doses per day.  I take the 2nd pill not for burn but for congestion that builds up in my throat.	So far I have had no side effects.  I have been taking Omeprazole every day for a couple of years.  Although I have been prone to exhaustion the past couple of years.  The doctor(s) all swear it can have nothing to do with the omeprazole.  I would quit using it to find out if my heartburn didn't return so quickly and severely.	Take one pill before breakfast and one in the evening.
2889	avita	8	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	reduce wrinkles	I'm using tretinoin to reduce the wrinkles around my eyes. So far I am happy with it- although even as an anti wrinkle treatment improves my skin- I continue to age- so it's an uphill battle. I do my best to take care of myself and had heard that this might help battle the little signs of age on my face. So far I'm pretty happy- nothing drastic, but hopefully continued use will help me to age gracefully and not drastically.	Definitely some peeling in the first 2-4 weeks especially around my chin. I also noticed that applying other products- like facial wash and sunscreen had a slight burning during the earlier stages.	I wash my face in the evening, let it dry, and apply the cream. It recommended that I wait 20-30 minutes after washing but I generally don't have that kind of time- I think that's to avoid irritation which isn't a problem anyway.
1395	ortho-evra	6	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control, heavy periods	Prevention of pregnancy, lighter periods	Very large amounts of hair loss,moodiness, nausea.  Patch fell off and had to use a second replacement patch.	Wanted a low maintenance birth control.  Side effects were enough to make me stop using.
2168	zyrtec	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	allergy - pollen/food syndrome	Reduction or resolution of symptoms related to histamine release- variously sneezing, watery eyes, allergic rhinitis, wheeze (inhaled allergens), oral itching, severe abdominal cramping and diarrhoea ( ingested allergens ). I suffer from pollen allergy which has led to severe food allergies particularly to nuts. Zyrtec works quickly within 15-30 minutes and causes no increased drowsiness, probably decreases it. ( the allergy itself makes one quite tired ).	None.	"Take one in the morning for prohylaxis when travelling or during pollen season.
Take 2 for severe allergic reaction. Crush tablet between teeth and swallow to make it faster to absorb."
962	sarafem	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	obsessive compulsive disorder	Significant reduction in perseveration; increased flexibility; reduction in obsessions such as the weather leading to ability to cope better with daily events, unexpected changes, disappointments etc.and increased ability to interact more appropriately socially	Some initial impact to sleep patterns, some weight gain	Initial dosage of 20 mgs, increased gradually to 60 mgs and maintained at that level have helped significantly with obsessions and impact of adolescence.

Doc took a look at my testosterone levels and said they were too high. He told me to quit taking any DHEA and to take aldactone in the morning and in the evening before bed. I didn't know that Aldactone would counteract testosterone, but it does.  New facial hair quit coming in and there has been lessening of facial hair that was already there.	none, other than needing to drink more water	Pop a pill twice a day -- what could be easier?

3463	ambien-cr	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	Fell asleep quickly, slept 7 hrs., woke up without hangover	Didn't work as well some of the time, woke up mid-way, some hangover effects	Ambien CR is a basically effective treatment for sleeplessness, although I have experienced incidents where contrary to the ads I have woken up midway through the night, I have had a groggy, hard to wake up feeling the next day lasting for several hours. There have also been reports of sleep eating, walking, awake but asleep incidents that I personally have not experienced, although it can affect you differently each  time you take it.
30	alprazolam	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	Able to cope more successfully during panic attacks and acute anxiety episodes. Able to sleep better at night (get to sleep).	The only side effects noticed were dry eyes upon waking in the morning.	Took 0.5 mg Xanax as needed for anxiety, prescribed by primary care physician. Was very helpful in getting me through an extremely stressful time of my life.
1505	metrogel	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	rosacea	Occasionally, my rosacea would come out on my nose and sometimes result in huge, painful pimples which also made my entire nose red and swollen. This started occurring bi-weekly for the past year or so. I started using Metrogel and haven't had an incident since!	none!	Just rubbed a thin layer over my nose every night before bed.
1801	famvir	6	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	chronic fatigue - epstein barr virus	The flare ups of fibromyalgia seemed to subside considerably. I was able to actually get out of bed during the day. I still, however, have bouts of pain; especially if I try to reduce the amount I take during the day.	Occasional upset stomach, dependency on taking the drug.	Taken as a pill three times a day.
3997	fosamax	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	post menapausal osteopenia	I didn't realize any benefits since the medication is preventative and needed to be taken over time to prevent osteoporosis. I had experienced some bone density issued related to  long term use of Prednisone or a period of years.	Within two weeks of the first dose I began feeling a lump in my upper stomach ,even though I took my pill first thing in the morning and remained standing for more than two hours. I still started to have a feeling of acid reflux which I have never had.  I reported continuing burning sensations in upper abdomen ,and gasy production which produced belches and burps , to the prescribing Dr. immediately but he suggested continuing the med ,and use an antacid which I tried. By the second dose I had serious heartburn ,reported it to the Dr. then discontinued the medication and they changed me to Actonel, once a week ,which had none of the same adverse side effect.	"I had a bone density study done and it was stated that I had osteopenia, related to over 12 years of prednisone and seroid use to treat my Sarcoidosis.

At the time I was seeing a Rhuemotogogist who was treating me for side effects like joint pain and swelling. I was told I didn't have osteoporosis yet, but to start taking the Fosamax to prevent it .  

I did but the issued reported above,meant I had to switch to another similar but milder medication , Actonel  and take it one lowered dose pill a week."
2174	zyrtec	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	seasonal allergies	For seasonal allergies, I would highly recommend Zyrtec.  I have had allergy shots to no avail, and have suffered from seasonal allergies my whole life.  While the side effects that I experienced were annoying, they did not negate the benefits of taking the medicine. It made all of my allergy symptoms disappear (itchy eyes, hayfever, nasal congestion etc)  The side effects were extreme cotton mouth, and I mean extreme. It also very much interrupted a restful night sleep.  However, as annoying as these are, it was worth it to have the affect of the drug itself in dealing with seasonal allergies.	Dry Mouth, Lack of sleep	For seasonal allergies, I would highly recommend Zyrtec.  I have had allergy shots to no avail, and have suffered from seasonal allergies my whole life.

3734	lamictal	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bipolar disorder	When I first started, I slowly made my way up to 300mg.  After the first two months, I noticed a difference.  Not a huge difference, but it was big enough for my family to notice.  It seemed to me though, after time, that my body got immune to the medication and I seemed to be back to the manic stages again.  I have been on tons of anti-depression medications that are prescribed for depression and bipolar disorder and it seems to my doctors/psychiatrists that my body just gets immune to them.	fatigue and memory loss	"I really wish this was the medication that finally worked for me, but unless some miracle happens, it's back to the drawing board.  I seem to still have my mania episodes everyday, sometimes it gets bothersome.  I seem to yell still, I have my days where all I want to do is stay in my room and not move.  I can't control my thoughts, but I still work everyday in hopes to finding that ""Miracle"" medication that will finally work for me!"
3913	nexium	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	indigestion and check pain	The chest pain went away almost immediately. I rarely had heartburn even when I ate spicey foods. Even though I still may have heartburn occasionally, the tightness of my chest and the frequent indigestion has almost completely disappeared. Before I had indigestion at random times during the day, which would cause unexpected chest pains.	I did not experience any side effects. Possibly because I did not the pills on an empty stomache.	My doctor asked me to take Nexium once a day until they were gone to see if the tightness in my check, the indigestion, and the heartburn could be cured by the pills. The tightness in the check and indigestion were not signs of heart problems as the doctor discovered. To date, the pills seemed to have worked.
2809	wellbutrin	2	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	none	irritability and extreme anxiety, mild panic attack	I have been on Zoloft with great results for over 5 years. I do not have a constant barrage of depressed thoughts or emotions when I am on the drug.  When my husband and I decided to try to have a baby, my ob-gyn suggested that I switch to Wellbutrin.  Some anti-depressants may carry a small risk of side-effects to the baby in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.  My ob-gyn felt that taking Wellbutrin may reduce these risks.   After 1 or 2 months on Wellbutrin, I began to feel very irrtable and anxious.  My chest began to tighten painfully with even the thought of something stressful.  After 4 months on Wellbutrin, I had my first panic attack ever.  I threw the pills in the trash and went to see a psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist told me that there was no medically proven benefit to switching to Wellbutrin, and put me back on Zoloft.  I feel much better!
3547	vivelle-dot	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hysterectomy	Amazing! I take nothing but this vivelle dot and add a dab of progeserone cream (natural) and vitamins. I have never felt better!	Get tired and have brain fogg if I forget to change patch.	Change patch every Sunday morning and Thursday night. Make sure I get script filled day before I need it! I will stay on this forever! If you suffer from hormone problems such as hair loss where you want it, hair growth where you don't want it, mild hot flashes, brain fogg, tired beyond your normal tired, but don't sleep without taking something. Past the word crabby, and cry because a little old lady won a car on a game show...honey, get it pulled out and put the patch on and get your life back!:)
2214	alendronate	3	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	osteoporosis	No benefits that I can see.  My doctor said it was not useful to do another bone scan to see if there had been a change in a year so I have no idea if there was any benefit.  I have been experiencing fairly severe leg pains for the past year and could not find out what they were from.  Did numerous tests, no results.  Then I saw on the insert that side effects could be muscle, bone or joint pain and when I read a comment on here describing dull aching in one leg in particular radiating down from the hip and below the knee. I thought...that is me!!!  So I am stopping this drug and waiting to see what happens with the new aches and pains.  Maybe it is this drug.  I hope so.	See above.	Took alendronate for osteoporosis for over a year.
578	furosemide-injection	2	Ineffective	No Side Effects	chf	The IV form was effective in removing excess fluid. The oral form did not.	The oral form did not remove the fluid.	Patient received IV form in hospital and fluid came off quickly and effectively. Oral form, which she was sent home on, did not work and she ended up back in the hospital within 24 hours. One of the doctors later admitted that there was something about the oral form that caused it to be ineffective in certain situations.
2632	depo-provera	5	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	birth control	It effectively prevented a pregnancy. And periods stopped immediately with rare and light spotting.	I had a few side effects. I got bad acne (which I haven't had since I was a teenager), and hair loss. I had lost 40 lbs before I began taking the shot. After my second shot I started gaining weight. I didn't change my eating habits in any negative way, and ended up gaining 20 lbs!	I received the shot once every three months for a total of a year. The side effects outweigh the benefits in my opinion. I don't plan on taking this drug in the future, or recommending it to anybody else. I am definitely doing more research before I take another birth control again.
253	ultram	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	cervical osteoarthritis	"Tramadol decreases the severity of pain associated with neck movement. It is not an opiate however it does provide pain relief (for me) along the lines of a mild narcotic without the ""euphoric"" or mind numbing effects. It allows me greater latitude of neck movement. It is very evident to me when the medication is wearing off as I can no longer turn my neck more than approximately 25 degrees. This drug has been a lifesaver for me and can sometimes even head off my milder migraines."	I've personally experienced no side effects other than an occasional jerky type feeling in my movements. I have heard from others that this medication, although non narcotic can be difficult to cease due to withdrawal symptoms. Personally I have  had no problem with this. This medication has been known to cause seizures and is not to be taken by anyone who has experienced a seizure.	I take two 50 mg. tablets as needed up to three times a day.
3376	lipitor	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	cholesterol	Benefits to taking Lipitor was that it helped reduce my total cholesterol numbers.  While that was a positive, the side-effects began to make me question the overall reduction in cholesterol numbers.	When I first started taking Lipitor I did not notice any side effects.  Approx. three months into taking the drug, however, I started noticing upset stomach.  At first I thought perhaps the caffeine in my coffee was creating the upset as I started drinking more than one cup daily.  I cutback on the coffee and did not notice a difference in stomach issues.  Approximately 6-8 months into taking the drug, I began to experience some discomfort in the legs.  As a distance walker I analyzed my workout routine to see if I had added something different but had not.  I quit taking the drug 12 months (give or take) after starting.	Treatment was simple:  take on tablet daily at bedtime.  The drug was (and did) to help reduce my overall cholesterol numbers.
2912	tramadol	5	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	interstital cystitis	"The first two days I took this drug the pain went away.  Then, the effectiveness declined rapidly.  I called my doctor and she increased the dosage to 100mg every 6 hours.  This helped for about two days, and then it was back to being ineffective.  

I think this is a rather weak way to manage daily pain associated with IC."	A little bit of nausea when the pill actually worked.  No side effects at all when the pill didn't work.	"My IC cocktail started to work after about a month and there wasn't much need for pain killers anymore so I just stopped taking Tramadol. 

In the future, when my IC would flare up, I requested no Tramadol and instead received Tylenol with Codiene.  It worked much better."
1288	zebeta	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypertension	"Taking this medication twice a day has kept my blood pressure within the ""normal"" range; even though I am over-weight. I do exercise everyday, although very minimally. I think it is just the medication that is keeping my blook pressure so low."	Sometimes, I feel a bit of light-headedness and dizzy. Sometimes sleepy. Although it is hard to tell if this is just from the medication or some other reason. But overall I am happy with the medication and plan on continuing to take it as long as I need to.	Before I started taking the medication, my blood pressure was extremely high. I didn't exercise much and I am was over weight. At my doctor's orders, I began taking the medication and it took a while to take effect, but when it did, it has and still continues to keep my blood pressure within the normal range. I continue to be over-weight, and I only exercise minimally, but everyday.
457	flagyl	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bacterial vaginosis	My infection cleared up almost before the dosage was done. Has not come back.	Mild upset stomach.	I took this once a day for eight days for a vaginal bacterial infection. I only had slight side effects of an upset stomach after taking the pill; probably because I had not eaten  much on those days. My infection cleared up noticably before the treatement was through. I feel it was very effective.

2344	propecia	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	1mg	"I was experiencing significant, rapid hair loss along the temples and top of the scalp (just behind hairline). My crown was relatively unaffected.

Crown: The same, maybe better

Top of scalp: Exceptional. Considerable regrowth, hair came back thicker.

Hairline/Temples: Considerable re-growth. Not back to ""normal"", but still very impressive. 

Propecia has shown the most benefit in clinical studies + real world practice in the crown area.
Its benefits are less pronounced as it nears the hairline. This has been my experience.

Hair loss stopped within 6 months,
significant re-growth @ 9 months. 
Re-growth continued thru 18 months, then has pretty much slowed down / stopped.

I have 3 close friends who also take it, all have had excellent.  results.            
         
For all who take Propecia, wait a full year before making a decision to discontinue."	"Some mild erection problems. Nothing anywhere bad enough where I would even CONSIDER stopping.
However I am 27 now...can't be 18 forever."	"Easy, one tab in the AM.
That's it."
2070	metformin	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	type 2 diabetes	In the beginning of my treatment for type 2 diabetes, I found the benefits of Glucophage or metformin for me to be two-fold.  Number one, metformin did seem to lower my blood sugar over a short amount of time in the beginning.  Number two, as a medication I found necessary in my life, I have found it fairly inexpensive to purchase as a generic drug.	The treatment side effects I experienced were in the beginning.  At the very start of taking Glucophage, I had diarrhea.  It did go away after some time on the drug.	I take 1000 mg caplets; one in the morning with my breakfast and one in the evening with my dinner.
1467	cymbalta	1	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	fibromyalgia and depression	I only noticed a very small benefit from taking Cymbalta for my muscle pain.	Cymbalta elevated my liver enzymes acutely after only being on the drug for a few months.  The doctor then titrated me off of it and it took three months after I stopped Cymbalta before my liver went back to normal.  Just be sure to have your liver enzymes checked regularly if you are on this drug.	I was on 90 mg daily, one dose of 60 mg and one dose of 30 mg.  It was prescribed to me for fibromyalgia and depression, however, I did not notice much improvement on this drug but I was not on it for a real long time either so it may just take longer to notice benefit but it definitely affected my liver.  My mom also has the same problem with Cymbalta and her liver enzymes.
584	acyclovir	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	shingles breakout	I used to break out with shingles and started taking the drug and the outbreaks stopped. After a year, I stopped taking it and whenever I feel like Im getting an outbreak, I take the drug for a few days and it goes away.  I barely get outbreaks anymore.	To my knowledge I had no side effects with the drug.	I just took the drug for a year twice a day.  Then stopped and just take it when I feel I am going to have an outbreak and after a few days, the symptoms dissapear and I dont get an outbreak.  This is great since the shingles outbreak were very painful and lasted a long time to go away.

308	protopic	5	Ineffective	No Side Effects	vitalago	The benefit that was hoped for was a repigmentation of the skins on my hands.  Apparently my dermatologist had used this treatment on a number of patients and had received a good success rate.  I did not see any benefits over the time I used the product (3 months) but was advised that I needed to continue treatment.	There were no noticeable side effects that I was aware of.  The product is an ointment with a rather oily feel and needs to be left on the effected areas for some period of time so I applied it at night.  I did not find that it had any effect in any positive or negative way over the period I applied it.	I was asked by the prescribing doctor to apply the ointment once a day to the affected areas (the back of both of my hands).  This was the entire process and I was to report back to him within a period of approximately six months.  This was a rather experimental treatment.  I applied the product as instructed but did not notice any repigmentation during the time I applied it (around 3 months).  I subsequently was advised by the doctor that I needed to continue the application, for a total period of at least six months
1909	avelox	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	swollen lymph nodes, sick	Cleared up the infection.  I had been on a less effective antibiotic a week earlier, which had not worked.	I got a small rash on my arms right after finishing all the pills.	I took 1 400 MG pill per day for 5 days and got plenty of rest and drank plenty of fluids.  (My lymph nodes and thyroid glands were swollen and I generally felt ill.)
2029	protonix	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux, gerd	Reduced acid in the stomach and heartburn symptoms associated with acid.	I didn't experience any side effects while taking this medication.	Took 1 40 mg tablet in the morning before my first meal and controlled the acid reflux symptoms and stomach aches. Then took 1 40 mg tablet before I went to bed to once again control those symptoms while sleeping for a 24 hour effect.
1291	zocor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hyperlipidemia	My total cholesterol level dropped from 282 to 150. The niaspan dropped my triglyceride level about 30 points!	The only side effects I had was from the Niaspan. I would get flushed and itchy (terribly uncomfortable). The doctor told me to take an aspirin (350mg) 30 minutes to an hour prior to taking the Niaspan. The aspirin worked well, I can take the Niaspan with no problems.	My treatment includes statin drugs and Niaspan because normal diet and exercise were not sufficient to keep my cholesterol level down. So, I take my medicine every night without fail, exercise at least 3X per week and I  incorporate more fruit and vegetables into my diet.
948	betamethasone	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	eczema	This cream preparation worked well, but over the years I ntoiced it was less effective.  I have used it very sparingly but I no linger use it on my hands becaue it causes seems to worsen the condition of the skin to split the skin in inflamed areas after application.  I use weaker hydrocortisone cream on my hands as a last resort.  Luckily that cream is just stron enough to offer some relief.	Over time (many years) I ntoiced reduced effectiveness and splitting of the skin in inflamed areas (on hands), despite using this product very sparingly.	I use this cream as little as possible - only when I have a serious flare-up of the eczema.  When I do use the cream I apply a reasonable amount to the skin - just enough to makae sure some cream comes in contact with all of the inflamed area.  I use the cream once or twice a day during the flare up.  Once I notice the inflammation is going down I stop using it- and teh skin finishes healing up on its own without further nedication.  I rinse the cream off my hands after applying becaue it is not helpful to treat eczema on my hands anymore.
465	flagyl	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	gum infection	the side effects put me in hospital and not able to work for weeks.  the gum infection cleared up but this took second place to the concerns during hospitalisation.  i did not bounce back to my usual good health after.	irritated heartbeat, palpatations, breathlessness, dizziness, anxiety, flue like symptoms, extreme fatigue, tingling, pain in arm	prescribed tablets by Dentist for gum infection.  i was told i should take antibiotics but nothing about how it works or side effects. i took the tablets until finished while feeling worse, breathless, dizzy, pain left arm and fatigue but put it down to body fighting gum infection.  the day after i finished the full course of tablets i couldn't breath and ready to pass out and went to Doctors and was taken to hospital with heart complications.  I have no health problems until now.

Prevents laboriously resetting body clock after an all night binge.	none	Taken usually after 2 am when it's pretty obvious I will be up all night if I don't and i can't afford to muck up my day by sleeping in! Taken just before retiring - enough time between swallowing the thing and the effects to safely brush teeth and get changed for bed, read a few pages of a book.
710	accutane	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Quick decrease in amount of acne; improved skin texture. Overall, the action of the drug was quite quick and effective, and my acne was resolved within the first 2 months of treatment	I experienced dry skin like many other users of this drug, as well as some joint pain. Part of my treatment period was during the winter, during which I was also prone to nose bleeds and fragile skin.	I took two 20mg pills daily following a meal with a moderate amount of fat (more than 10 grams). The time of day I took the medication varied depending on when I would be consuming a moderate-fat meal.
3956	prilosec	2	Marginally Effective	No Side Effects	gerd	the product was supposed to control heartburn, but had very little affect, even after 14 days of use.	None	"When I first began having heartburn, my physician prescribed Prilosec D/R.  I hadI took if for several weeks, but it didn't seem to control the heartburn.

He then prescribed Ranitidine,300mg, which I took for several years with very good results.

When I was sent for an upper endoscopy, the performing doctor suggested I take Prilosec.  I tried it again, for a month, but I began having severe heartburn again.

Now I am taking Nexium, which works very well for me."

Itching was primarily on skin around elbows and also sinus congestion.	The main side-effects were extreme drowsiness and dry mouth.  This became less prevalent as time went on.	I was taking 4mg tablets three times per day. one in morning, one in afternoon, one in the evening.
3356	lipitor	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	high  cholesterol	My cholesterol levels were very high.  Te plan was to take Lipitor for one month and then see if the levels were lower. No benefits were identified because I could not take take  the medicine long enough to get a second  cholesterol test to measure for measuring any decrease in my cholesterol levels.  After having side effects, I did try to lower the dosage to 10m by cutting the pills in half, but still felt the bad effects.	At first, I did not associate my increasing tiredness and general lack of energy with the medicine. I just thought I was getting sick with a virus. Then, as time went on, I started to also experience muscle soreness and tightness.  By the time I started to think the way I was feeling might be related to the Lipitor, I realized, besides the physical symptoms,  I was in a state of depression.  As soon as I quit taking the pills, all the bad symptoms cleared.  A few days later, I tried taking less (half), but, again started feeling bad.	As previously stated, because my cholesterol levels were high, the doctor said I should take Lipitor for one month and then we would retest the cholesterol levels to see if the medicine was effective in lowering the levels. But, because I was unable to take the Lipitor for the entire month, the  second  cholesterol test was never taken.  After taking the Lipitor for about 10 days, I stopped taking it.  A few days later, I did try to take just half a pill.  But within days, the side effects started to return.
1836	yasmin	5	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	birth control	"Well, I had no babies. 

Also, skin was a bit clearer and breasts got about half a cup bigger (but that came with the rest of my body getting bigger, too)."	"I gained 10 lbs in just a couple months, I had period munchies all the time, and could always eat. I felt uncomfortable turning down food and seemed to have a never-ending appetite. This would subside during the sugar pill week.

I suspect, but am not sure, that Yasmin also gave me some vaginal dryness. I had frequent painful sex, would get raw very easily, and actually got a tear inside my vagina from sex. If we went at it twice a day it seemed I would need a day or two break just to recover. (None of this has happened before, so the doctor suggested I move to a lower dose pill.)"	Take once a day at the same time everyday.
3509	minoxidil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hair loss	The benefits of using minoxidil was the halting of DHT buildup in the scalp around hair follicles. It also improved circulation to the scalp. This encouraged the recovery of thinning hair to become thicker and fuller. This halted hair loss and restored hair to cover up signs of male pattern baldness.	There were no observed side effects with the use of this product.	1mL Minoxidil was applied twice daily to the scalp until the entire dose and been absorbed. treatment was coupled with Low Light Laser Therapy - 650nm 5W lasers that served to biostimulate the scalp and help in the halting of the effects of DHT.
2501	naprosyn	1	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	muscle inflammation	None.  I was told it would take 6 weeks for the medicine to accumulate and become completely effective.  It did not produce any results that were apparent.  Not in inflammation reduction or in pain reduction due to the inflammation were any results ascertainable.  I suffered while waiting for this medication to do anything.  Further, you are told to consume food to protect the lining of your stomach from this medication.  Not always something you want to do when you are experiencing a lot of pain because pain can make you feel like vomiting.	Stomach issues, burning  The more adverse affect was the constant pain due to the continuing inflammation with the added and increasing reduction in movement, and muscle usage.  Worst, was the waste of time.  Another med could have been prescribed in the time I used this medicine that would have been more effective and time healing would not have been wasted.  In fact, another anti-inflammatory was prescribed that provided immediate benefits (30 minutes) without the build-up in your system that the M.D. and pharmacist said Naprosyn requires before it becomes effective.	Tried various dosages from the lowest, to more frequency.  It simply had little affect on inflammation or pain.  No other pain medication was added to this treatment and no other medication was given.  I had a car accident and suffered whiplash, thoracic muscle strain, herniation of entire lumbar region, etc.  Inflammation was rampant from hip level up.  Any relief would have been noted and appreciated.  Another drug was later prescribed, another anti-inflammatory, which proved just how much the naprosyn did not work.  I had immediate pain relief in 30 minutes and notable inflammation reduction very quickly.  In fact, after a 3 week loading of this drug, I was able to get out of bed, move around, and be functional!  The Doctor insisted on trying this level, Naprosyn, first and then changed after 6 weeks, to supposedly stronger medication in some kind of protocol progression.  I now tell my doctors which medication works and refuse anything else.  They waste time on ineffective medications allowing suffering.  I saw the doctors within the 6 week period declaring and their noting how ineffective this medication was.
899	paxil	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	mild depression	"Less tired, less sleepy, more motivated for working and daily chores. Much less of headaches and Fioricet worked better when I had ones.
Naproxen 500 mg relieved the arm pain for 7 hours."	Decreased sex emotions was the main side effect of Paxil, it made me somewhat numb. As to Fioricet , it seemed to me I became used to it, overtime I needed 2 tabs. to kill headache, instead of one tab. as it used to be.	Paxil has been taken regularly for 4 years, then stopped by myself. I had to restart it after 2 months, because some symptoms did return.
2188	clonazepam	9	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety, ocd	After 12 years of living with anxiety problems I discovered clonazepam and now this is my emergency pill. Fast effects which relaxes me quickly.	When I take clonazepam I feel a little dizzy, just like being drunk! Its gives me a light headache. My body feels so lazy that i feel I am stuck in it. This could be a strange effect for some but it's sure better than panic!	when needed
887	paxil	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	depression	There were no benefits. I was repeatedly told it wasn't working because I just hadn't been on it long enough and my dosage wasn't high enough. It did not help the depression at all and it was expensive.	"Trying to slowly reduce the dosages so the medicine could be stopped resulted in very frequent ""brain zaps."" These felt like electrical shocks in the head any time I moved. The electrical shocks could be felt in my arm and chest sometimes as well. The only thing that helped was to lay down and be as still as possible, but even that did not stop the shocks. This went on for 6 months. The gradual stepping down of dosage was monitored by a doctor and was even done slower than normal but it did not prevent the ""brain zaps."" Headaches and some nausea also accompanied the shocks."	Started with 20mg and gradually increased to 50mg. After a year of treatment and no improvement the drug was eventually decreased and stopped.
4103	chantix	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	smoking cessation	Very heavy smoker.  Was able to reduce smoking to half pack per day in the run up to totally quitting.  Then was able to quit.	Skin itching; insomnia, strong urine smell; weight gain	The side effects, aside from the weight gain, were tolerable enough to enable me to quit.  I have back slid a couple of times and found taking the pill for a few days resolved the problem.  It has been a year since I first started taking the drug.
410	imitrex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraine headaches	Complete relief from pain with one 100 mg tablet. Alleviated the sensitivity to light, noise and nausea.

1782	citalopram	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	My doctor has this combined with Hydroxozine and I feel wonderful.  I have taken Paxil, Lexapro and a few others since I was about 12.  I would def. say that this drug combination has worked the best.  The first two weeks I experienced withdrawls from my other med(Lexapro) but after that, I am great and back to new :)	For the first couple of weeks I had withdrawls from prior medication.  But that is all I have experienced.	"I believe that this, and the hydroxozine are a miracle drug combo.  I have suffered from anxiety since around age 7 and I finally have a ""normal""  life."

The itch would disappear within a few hours the bumps would loose all redness but would remain slightly raised for a couple of days	I had no side effects at all, but as i need to write 50 words it may also be worth noting that I had the positive effect of the painful Achilles tendon I had also disappeared after taking the tablets for 2 days	As soon as the prickly heat starts I had to take 6 tablets daily for a maximun of 10 days I have never had to take the tablets for more than 3 consecutive days

3575	differin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	localized acne	Differin has practically eliminated my acne.  I also used it on my forehead, where I have brown spots from a college-days sunburn (appx 10 years ago).  The spots have clearly faded, though are not completely gone.	Side effects were peeling and some redness, but only occurred the time that i used too much Differin.  I knowingly put more than prescribed on my chin in hopes of getting rid of an outbreak before vacation.  The redness and peeling was very noticeable.	Treatment includes adding only about 1/3 pea sized amount to my chin area and the same amount to my forehead after cleansing at night.  This I do daily.  I combined this with a regular alpha-hydroxy exfoliation night creme (applied after the Differin dries) in order to catalyze (by my own approximation) the skin rejuvenation/renewal.
4024	celexa	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	My father became extremely depressed following his mild stroke. About 2 weeks after we increased the dose from 10-20mg, there was a significant change in his attitude and he embraced life again.	Occasional light-headedness.	After his mild stroke, my Dad could not continue his previously active routine. He hated not being able to drive his new car to meet his friends for their daily breakfast. He was always on the go, even at home he was constantly puttering with gadgets & watching stocks on the computer. All of this had suddenly been taken from him and he was angry & frustrated that he was unable to do these previously simple tasks. Depression set in and he just gave up on life. He would even dream that he was dead. He cried & moaned a lot (my Dad never cried before). I was pleased with the results from this medication.

3688	effexor-xr	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety	eased my anxiety, helped me start going to work more.	This drug was extremely difficult to start. I had headaches and dizziness for weeks. Also caused digestive problems - bloating and flatulence. Had no energy - before I took this drug I was a very active person but once on it I had no energy to excercise. Also craved sugary and carbohydrate rich food which ended up giving me thrush and other fungal infections. Caused concentration problems. I stuggled to concentrate on my work for a full day. I also felt very flat.	Am stopping this drug and going on to paroxetine again as the side effects outweighed the benefits.
34	alprazolam	5	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	panic attacks	It was very good in controlling the panic attacks. Before taking it I was even unable to drive my car down the road without having a panic attack. I worked liked magic from the very first dose. I could resume to being close to feeling like a normal person again.  It worked well for panic attack prevention.	"There were no real side effects other than a dry mouth. I still suffered from some anxiety symtoms such as feeling a bit nervous restless, sometimes had trouble sleeping. If I drank alcohol at the same time in small amounts, I felt even better and seemed to have no bad feeling at all but that was short lived, and as I found out later on also dangerous. And Just don""t ever stop taking it suddenly. Thats also very dangerous."	"The treatment was to take three 1 mg tablet a day, with food. The trouble was that I became very reliant on the medication and felt I needed to keep taking it. Then one day I decided to quit and I just stopped taking it. I don""t know why I did not  slowly wean myself off over a couple of weeks. Over the course of the next three days I never got out of the house I was sick, shaking uncontrollably, having hallucinations both audial and visual I thought I was going to die. I felt like  hell. A friend found me and took me to the doctor. It was the worst feeling I have ever felt in my life it was the withdrawal symptoms from the drug. All I needed to do was take more, but I felt to afraid. To this day I cant tell you why I just could""nt think straight."

2003	vicodin	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	shoulder & neck pain	None.  Vicodin is a narcotic for severe pain. I was prescribed it after weeks of physical therapy and ibuprophin did not reduce the pain in my shoulder and neck following a ski crash.	Much to my dismay, the drug made me feel extremely nauseated. Though I did not actually throw up, I felt like it for a day. Furthermore, the pain in my neck and shoulder did not improve. Even if it had, I would have discontinued Vicodin anyway.	My doctor did not mention any possible side effects, nor did he tell me it is a narcotic. Apparently, it is a drug of abuse. Also, nausea is a common side effect. I was only told that it was a pain killer that would alleviate my discomfort.
138	valtrex	9	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	genital herpes	the sores disappeared much sooner than with regular treatments (acyclovir) and the pain disappeared the next day.	Due to my chronic gastritis, I had minor stomach aches but nothing too bad	The treatment was started on the second day of the sore outbreak, and I noticed the effect very quickly: the next day I felt barely any pain and the sore disappeared much faster than usual (about 4-5 days overall vs the previous 7-9 days)
4157	aygestin	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	endometriosis	well it was supposed to stop my painful periods from my endometriosis and its suposed to stop my endometriosis from growing.	depression, nausea, anxiety, heart racing, still in pain, still having painful breakthrough bleeding.	"well ive been takin it everyday for 5 months and if one more doctor tells me ""its gonna take some time"" im going to break something. i start college soon (again, had to drop out due to my painful constant periods) so im getting real tired of feeling like dirt all of the time. its supposed to make everything better and it hasnt done jack crap. i also have to take opana for the pain (morphine pills) and im going into medical school and they dont like drugs in youre system"
49	clarinex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	sinus allergies/hives	I sometimes get hives or sinus type allergies.  When I take this anti-histamine I notice that it works quickly and is very effective for hours.  I never get sleepy like I do with most other over the counter anti-histamines.	I did not notice any side effects.	One small pill a day is all it takes to relieve my mild to moderate sinus allergies and occassional hives.
516	tenormin	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	an unknown ekg wave abnormality	Decreased nausea, dizziness when standing, pins and needles sensation. Eyes and Skin less sensitive to sunlight.	Extreme sleepiness (25mg feels like I took a Tylenol PM). Slight inability to concentrate. Depression of mood, slight irritability. I have noticed some suggest this is also prescribed for anxiety, I haven't noticed any reduction in anxiety, I have noticed if I'm irritated the irritability seems to last a bit longer than normal. It has done nothing to increase my motivation or productivity.	I already have a low heart rate, so an hour after taking it I always take 200mg caffeine + 2 Primatene tablets (25mg Ephedrine HCL) to raise heartbeat while the Atenolol stabilizes it. The Ephedrine also helps to counteract sleepiness and depressed mood Atenolol causes in my system. I was going to quit taking it but over 2 months I have slowly experienced an increase in my health, before I was almost bed-ridden, now I can get up and walk around for extended periods of time. I originally had a bad case of Mono a few years back and it still showed in my system, he said it probably caused a bad case of Chronic Fatigue but it is not considered a real medical condition, so he wrote me a script for Atenolol after my EKG. They took 6 EKG's that read no heartbeat and the 7th read a supposedly impossible wave, I did every test from two separate doctors, they have no idea what it is.
333	neurontin	5	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	chonic pain	I did see improvement in numbness and tinglng in upper extremities. Helps marginally for sleep.	Poor concentration, drowsiness, dizziness, memory problems. My physian tried to titrate dose to 2400mg per day. The side effects were intolerable to the point that I was having prolems at work. I currently take 600mg hs.	I plan to discontinue this medication as the side effects are not worth the marginal benefit
845	ritalin	5	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	When I first began taking the Ritalin, I noticed a dramatic effect on my mood.  I felt wonderful!  I was energetic and positive and I felt that I could handle anything that came my way.  I don't want to sound as though I felt euphoric or manic - I just felt really GOOD about life.  However, after only a few days, that sense of confident well-being drained away.	Initially, the medication kept me awake all night but that only happened for a night or two.  I take them on an empty stomach in the morning and sometimes my hands shake very slightly for a while but it's not enough to cause any problems.	My psychiatrist put me on it to 'give a boost' to my other antidepressant.  He says I am taking a miniscule amount, and that I could increase the dosage if I wished but I have been reluctant to do so.  Perhaps I should - I may not be taking enough to be effective but I am on three different antidepressants and I feel uneasy about sharply increasing the Ritalin dose.  In short, initially, I felt GREAT but now I feel just the same as ever - struggling with the thoughts that cause lack of energy & enjoyment in many spheres of life.
540	trazodone	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	insomnia	"it was not good,had to dismiss previous primary doctor&ortopedic surgeon as my best interests were not of thier concern,I now have a new primary doctor&orthopedic surgeon as both knew about fractured clavicle/shouder rotocuff

904	paxil	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	panic attack	My anxiety when driving was lowered.	None	One day I was driving on a freeway (280, San Francisco Bay area) and felt like I was going to faint.  It was a clear day, not much traffic as it was the middle of the day and this freeway is more of a 'country' freeway than our main one, 101.  I pulled over to the shoulder so I could compose myself.  I felt like I was having a panic attack (which I had never had before but friends have) so I took deep, slow breaths to calm myself.  When I felt I was alright, I returned to the freeway but had to pull over once more before I reached home.  I have never been in an accident nor had this feeling before so could not rationalize what was happening. After it happened a few more times, I put paper bags in my car (for breathing) and started using side roads, where I had no problems.  When I went to my doctor, I told him about my anxiety and he prescribed Paxil for me.  I began taking it and, it took a while, though I wasn't ready to try the freeway right away, but it has definitely helped. I am now more willing to just get on the freeway.  I have not noticed any side effects from taking it or changes in my personality...I did not need it for depression or any other anxiety but freeway driving.
3776	metronidazole	6	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	diverticulitis	The benefits were that the infection was eleminated. The infection had apparently grown over a period of several months and then reached a point that it suddenly was accute. I say it grew slowly over several months because my abdominal area, even as far up as including my waist, had grown from about 30 inches to about 33 inches and I required clothing two sizes larger. I had become more and more weak but thought that it was my age (even though up until a few months before the swelling started I was still hiking up to 10 or 11 miles a day in the Andes in Chili or in the Canadian Rockies. Weakness had suddenly become so accute that it was causing my heart to labor so much that radio-active dye x-rays were taken of my heart. My abdomin had a sonigram to see if I had ovarian cancer.	The metronidazole 500 mg and the ciprofloxacin 500 mg wer prescribed one tablet of each twice a day for two weeks. However, after several days I began to have slight light headedness, tingling in my fingers, much short-term memory loss, and constant whistling in my ears. By the sixth day these side-effects had intensified to the point that my hands were shaking, I was dizzy, and the doctor told me to discontinue the meds.Eleven weeks have passed and I still have CONSTANT whistling in my ears, my short term memory has improved but has not totally returned, and my bowels still do not work without taking a stimulant. I am taking probotics (460 mg each,6 billion total microorganisms per capsule twice daily), eating such as Activia daily, etc to try to repace the healthy bacteria level in my intestines but as stated earlier this is not yet accomplished. I am very tired of hearing the constant whistling in my ears.	This may be covered in the treatment benefits section,  The prescribed dosage was 500 mg (along with ciprofloxacin 500 mg) both twice daily for two weeks: however, by the sixth day the side effects were severe enough that the doctor told me to discontinue taking both the metronidazole and the ciprofloxacin.
931	mevacor	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	high cholesterol	NONE!!!!!	I began having very irregular heart rhythm within about 2 1/2 weeks of taking this medicine.  Feeling like I was going to pass out or maybe my heart would even stop beating.	"I began having very irregular heart rhythm within about 2 1/2 weeks of taking this medicine.  I began feeling like I was going to pass out or maybe my heart would stop beating & I would just keel over & die if I didn't immediately start moving around. I could be sitting or laying down in bed & these ""spells"" would come on out of the blue & very regularly.  I spent one night up all night laying on the couch because it was so bad that I was afraid that if I fell asleep I might not wake up. I tried to pretend it would go way at first but then made an appointment with my Dr. first & then a cardiologist, it was just too scary. My Dr. didn't believe that it was the medicine. By the time I could get in to see the cardiologist & have the heart monitor holster, echocardiogram etc. done I had been off the medicine for 2 weeks & the symptoms had lessened & of course did not appear while I was being tested. The Dr. thought I was crazy & that there was no way it was the medicine & that maybe I was having panic attacks.  I have never had a panic attack in my life & I have had similar heart rhythm symptoms with other meds that quit when I stopped taking them & I know my own body.  It WAS the lovastatin.  It took a year & a half before I started feeling normal again & didn't have these attacks come on sometimes.  I truly believe the lovastatin had an affect on my heart that took that long to get better. I will NEVER take another cholesterol med again that has the possible side affects of affecting muscles.  The heart is a muscle.  I also found that other people have had this same experience while taking statins while I was researching this on the internet.  Neither Dr. would even look at the article I printed out about it & it was even written by another Dr. who was researching statin side affects."
2245	zovirax	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	cold sores	"Shortened time span of cold sore. 
Sometimes alleviating symptoms entirely."	None	"If you take one pill as soon as you feel the tingle of a cold sore coming on, often it will not even appear at all. I know you might think, ""Maybe there wasn't really one in the first place."" But if you get cold sores regularly, you know. Sometimes if I couldn't get to the pills right away and a cold sore did appear, I would take a total of 4-5 pills in the course of the next 24 hours, and the sores would often be gone within 2 days instead of the usual 10. If you can't get to the pills within the first 24 hours, there is really not much good they can do after that, from my experience. This drug is kind of expensive--if I recall from before I had insurance, it was $50-75 for a bottle of Zovirax, but now they have a generic form so it is probably less. Regardless, this drug is worth its weight in gold."
3812	solodyn	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	acne	While on the drug I did not have any large, red acne lesions.	"Lupus-like symptoms that were very severe:
light sensitivity
extreme fatigue
severe joint point
iritis (inflammation of the iris of the eye)
knee, wrist and finger pain that continues 4 months after stopping the drug
iritis flared again 4 months after stopping the drug"	"After I turned 38 my skin changed.  It became much oilier and I started having large acne lesions again around my chin.  This was especially true before a period or when I was under stress at work.  I decided to see a dermatologist as I was sick of the acne.  I started Yaz which was alright, as well as Retin-A.  This didn't seem to address the larger lesions so my dr. prescribed Solodyn.  Looking back now, I think the side-effect started in the first couple weeks, I just didn't identify them as related to the drug.  I thought I was suffering from carpal tunnel at work and could explain why my knees hurt so much.  I was just about to go to an orthopod when I decided to investigate the Solodyn more.  I read about the joint pain and Lupus-like symptoms, stopped the drug immediately and called my dr. to get in and see her.  She did some bloodwork and I had a positive ANA blood result (mid-positive, not low).  This is one indicator of lupus.  My dermatologist was adamant that the symptoms would go away now.  I called the office again a week later as I was still having strong side effects and was pretty worried.  I got a phone call back that basically said ""hello, hypochondriac, you do not have lupus.""  Then my eye pain started and my eye turned totally red.  I went to my GP who referred me to an opthalmologist who diagnosed iritis and I started 7 weeks of drops.  She also referred me to a rheumatologist who ran a number of tests and told me she's seen minocycline drugs do this to people a lot and she would never take one or have her children take one - great.  That's my saga.  Now dealing with another iritis flair up and a lot of pain in my left knee, 4 months after stopping the drug.  Please don't take this drug!!!"
501	paxil-cr	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	ocd	"I felt reduced anxiety and compulsions;  less need for perfection;  better able to live with ""good enough""; less stress and happier; no more depression."	Ihad to stop nursing; constipation (must take 2 stool softeners per day); it killed my sex drive; skipping more than two days causes serious headaches, after three days of missed meds you go into withdrawal...much like heroin withdrawal.  Never have I been so ill or wanted to die.	Along with psychotherapy, I started taking prozac, with no effect after 2 months.  I switched to paxil with constipation and I needed at least 10 hours of sleep to come out of it each morning. I switched to selexa with no effect.  I then tried zyprexa  which caused me to gain 10 lbs in a month, gave me memory loss and I started lactating again.  By then, they had come out with paxil-cr (extended release) and I have been on that ever since.  I would like to switch to something that doesn't kill my sex drive and make me want to die when I go off of it, but I am afraid to stop without the proof of something else working better.
3339	clarithromycin	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sinus infection due to seasonal allergy	It cleared up the sinus infection within 2 days.	A bitter taste in mouth moticeable at night and especially in the morning. It went away as soon as I had something to drink. There was no bitter taste during the daytime. Also got a yeast infection on day 8. I still have to go through 5 days of medicine. I once took it on empty stomach and got acidity 1/2 hour later.	I was given Naproxen to control the inflammation and pain in my throat. I was also given Nasonex 2 puffs in each nostril daily. Claritin 10 mg once daily as antihistamine, which worked brilliantly. Also Clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 14 days. I stopped everything but the antibiotic and Claritin and am doing just fine.
4082	mobic	4	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	anti inflamatory	When I have flareups of pain, taking the meloxicam with the cyclobenzoprine and a good nights sleep would leave me pain free in the morning.	Extremely lethargic the entire next day, even if I took the meloxicam by itself	I am supposed to take the tablet once a day, however due to how tired I get for the entire next day, I only take as needed.  I did not figure out the problem with this drug until my son had to take it for something and he was totally wiped out as well.  So, I really try to use as little as possible, even though I have a permanent prescription for it.
3518	lunesta	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	"Lunesta allowed me to have a restful nights sleep, every night, even sleeping through ""hot flashes.""  In combination with cutting out tv at least one hour before bed, a hot bath, and occassionally meditiation - I had a sound sleep and awoke rested and revived."	"I did not have the much talked about ""bad taste"" in my mouth.  I did have a ""hung over"" feeling but not often, and the feeling went away within 5 minutes of waking."	The treatment worked for me:  I enjoyed a good nights sleep and awoke rested and revived.  Any side effects were minimal and infrequent.  I have tried many other medications over the years and this one is the most satisfactory.
22	azulfidine	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	colitis	reduced bleeding and inflamation initially, then less bloating, diareaha and nausea.	some sunlight sensitivity (sunburn more easily) and reduced sperm count.	began with two 500mg tablets three times a day by mouth.  reduced to twice a day after six months.  symptoms gradually subsided in the first three months.  on maintenance dose currently.
2037	protonix	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	reflux	temporary relief of reflux symptoms, but severe breakthroughs occasionally still happen.  Have been taking the med for over 4 years but without taking it the symtpoms are definitely worse.  The symptoms were, lump in throat, hoarseness, painful speaking, burning throat, burping, fluids coming back into mouth, pain in the center of the chest.	I have never noticed any side effects from taking the protonix.  I had read the list, but appear to be having no trouble. I have been taking the medication for over four years and am still taking the medication.  I only notice that when I think the reflux is under control and I stop taking it, my symptoms return with a vengence.	I have had the endoscope one time and on two different occasions had the tube inserted into my nose to check the vocal chords to diagnose why I lose my voice.  My regular every day treatment dose is one 40 mg pill, but have been told at two different times by two different doctors to double up on that for two months.  I notice improvement but once regular dosage is resumed the symptoms usually flare up.
3794	keflex	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	chronic sinusitis	You do not have to take this medicine with food and there is a much lower risk oh GI upset like you may experience with other antibiotics.	None	I took the Keflex after taking Augmentin for a week without results.  Also, being pregnant my OB/GYN felt more comfortable with me being on Keflex than Augmentin.  The treatment last longer than other antibiotics but seems to be more effective thus far.  No GI effects and no signs of yeast infection like a lot if women experience with antibiotics.
3055	seroquel	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	bi-polar, depression	For the first two months it seemed to help, even though the first night on it was the scariest feeling ever. It made me motivated for those two months..	I ended up with severe anxiety and paranoia after taking this pill, something I had never had before taking it. After the initial 2 month honeymoon period, I felt like I was a zombie..I literally felt nothing at all, and if I was lucky enough to feel something, it would be anxiety. I'm STILL trying to reverse the effects of this drug, and I've been off it for over 3 years now. I would not recommend this to ANYONE, unless you're willing to ruin your personality & life for the sake of a two month good spell.	.
3341	optivar	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	dry, allergic eyes	relieved some of the itching	blurred vision for 90 seconds after administering; burning sensation	Was prescribed for 1 month for dry, itchy eyes.  I took Optivar for 5 days, then called the ophtamologist about the burning sensation.  He advised me to discontinue the Optivar and wrote a prescription for Alrex.
483	meridia	5	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	weight loss	Definitely lifted mood. Helped me feel full and able to turn down unhealthy snacks.  Helped me eat reasonable portions.	Occasional headache.  Mild occasional insomnia	"Taken once a day it acts as a mood lifter and helps you feel full with less food.  It helped me take off a few pounds.  However, it is only a tool and patient has to be diligent about monitoring hunger and deciding to limit portions.  It's easy to ""eat around"" the drug and overeat. For short term weight loss or to help lose 10 -15 lbs it is great. VERY expensive...$125 for one months supply."
3654	retin-a	10	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	wrinkling aroung the eyes and lips	Yes very beneficial, although I will discontinue using the cream on face every night and maybe use every other night, until my skin adjusts. I also use the cream on the back of my hands and decollete area, love the results! I can see a HUGE difference in my hands already (probably about 1 month of consistant use) I have a few small sun spots that have lightened significantly, the skin on the back of my hands appears less elephant like ( tough, rough, wrinkling skin) and now appear more smooth, radiant and even toned.My decollete area has also seen great improvment, again more even toned, smooth, I have not seen a great deal of tightening, but I am very happy with the results thus far--- about 1 month of consistant use.	Some redness and peeling around the outside of my eyes and upper lip. Caused sensitivity when using other products....night creme, serums and sunscreen. I have read that these side affects are normal and part of the skin adjusting to the retin a.....after all that is what it is supposed to do...create a chemical change in the cell which promotes cellular turnover resulting in newer, firmer skin.	Daily apply about a pea size amount of the creme on my hand and sparingly apply to the orbital area, lips and forehead. I add additional creme to the back of my hands and rub vigourously ( rubbing the back of my hands together). I also apply a dime size to my neck and decollete area also rubbing, but not as vigourously. I generally do this every night after I cleanse, tone and add serums ( for pigment relief and building collegen) if I am feeling especially dry after applying the Tretinoina,I will also add a moisturizer.
3684	effexor-xr	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression, anixety?	I felt alive again, starting to go out more, spent time doing things I enjoyed had energy to go to the gym for the first time in my life	"I started to date a married man, that lead to me becoming obsessed. he was my boss. I clinged to him because I felt alone. I then quit my job and tried to overdose on these meds.. drank a bottle of alcohol and then took several pills and sleeping pills. ended up in emergeny and then just went right off them without supervision. to this day I take nothing and Im still very depressed. Im seeing a doctor again and trying to figure out what to do. I tried to go back on them and felt instantly high for two days taking the lowest dose there was. almost like my brain said NO WAY are u takin this again.. 

I don't recommend taking this unless u have a good doctor . the doc that gave me this medication was a walk in clinic who knew nothing about me."	".. well I was taking this after breaking out of a relationship that I was in for 3 years. I was depressed living in a room that i rented off a friend. I was living before with the boyfriend in a home he owned but we bought together.

3319	dilantin	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	head injury  / brain trauma	The benefits were the prevention of seizures following brain surgery	Initially after surgery I was given Dilantin injections which were very painful. It felt like concentrated acid was being injected into my vains with a painful burning sensation that lasted several minutes after each injection. After 3 weeks I was changed to oral dilantin (100mg 3 times daily). So no more painful injections.	As mentioned above I was prescibed Dilantin to avoid seizures following brain surgery. I was given dilantin injections for a period of 3 weeks while in hospital and then it changed to taking oral dilantin (100mg 3 times daily)for a year. During the year I had one seizure after 6 months which happened on the night that I felt well enough to have some drinks with my friends for the first time since the operation. I didn't drink again for the following 6 months while on dilantin and did not have any more seizures. I stopped dilantin after 12 months and have had no seizures since

4135	chantix	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	smoking cessation	helped somewhat in minimizing the cravings and anxiety while taking it but still required substantial will power to quit.  Considering the absolute hell I went through to quit I will probably never go back to smoking.	acute nausea, mental fog, vivid dreams, poor sleep quality, sore eyes, constipation, uncontrollable flatulence, euphoria, turned to dark depression, Psychosis NOS, Major Depressive Disorder, Suicidal ideation, self detrimental behaviour, emotional lability, agression, rage, panic attacks, hallucination, Somatoform Disorder, Delusional Parasitosis, Cholinaergic Prurritus, Hyperacusis, Severe sleep depervation; excessive dreaming, inability to sleep deeply, feeling half awake while sleeping, waking up with sore eyes., Brain Fog, lowered inhibitions, hair roots hurting, excessive hair loss, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, puffy bags under eyes, excessive weight gain, gingivitis, prostate pain, inability to feel orgasm, decreased ability to maintain and achieve erections, anhedonia.	"I took Champix in March of '08 and I am still suffering from most of the side effects of this poisonous drug.  I started to feel some of the bad effects (nausea, mental fog, trouble sleeping, sore eyes, constipation, gas) of Champix while taking it but I was determined to quit smoking.  For the first month I felt exceptionally good and I was telling everyone how great it was but the euphoria came crashing down and I went into a deep depression.   I was able to make it through the full 3 month course but when I stopped taking it is when I really got messed up. I developed Psychosis NOS, Major Depressive Disorder, suicidal, Emotional instability, aggression, rage, panic attacks, hallucination, Somatoform Disorder, Delusional Parasitosis (bug crawling sensations all over my body), Hyperacusis (sensitivity to certain frequencies of sound causing severe pain and pressure in my ears), Severe Insomnia, Memory Loss, Brain Fog, Lowered Inhibitions, Hair was constantly hurting all of the time and lost lots of it (27 year old male), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (started as extreme constipation and gas, fatigue, Severe Eye pain, unsightly puffy bags under eyes, excessive weight gain, gingivitis, prostate pain, black out and become out of control when drinking, decreased sexual pleasure and ability to maintain erections. I think that is everything!!! I went to the psych ward recently due to being suicidal and at a breaking point with my symptoms and I was treated like scum and given brain damaging neuroleptic (anti-psychotic) drugs against my will. I have made some small improvements since taking Champix but it looks like the nightmare will never truly end. If you are one of the many that gets burned by this medication be warned that the doctors will probably not be able to help you and will most likely deny that anything is even happening to you or that it is related to Champix and the side effects may be permanent.  I had a similar reaction in respect to rage and disinhibition from taking Zoloft when I was younger which altered my life substantially and now Champix has put the nail in the coffin.  Apparently these two drugs have a similar mechanism but Pfizer with held this information and marketed the drug in a deceiving way not mentioning any of the neuro-psychiatric and mind altering side effects of the drug when it first hit the market in order to boost sales of their poison.  The medical community has know for quite some time that dopamine plays a role in mood regulation and the fact the Champix targets the �pleasure centre� of the brain makes them grossly negligent for not investigating this further and informing consumers.  Many people including myself (I turned down a prescription of Zyban due to my experience with Zoloft) would not have taken it if we would have been informed of the risks and Pfizer knew that.  SHAME ON THEM FOR RUINING MY LIFE AND MANY OTHERS INCLUDING THOSE WHOM ENDED THE MISERY BY TAKING THEIR OWN LIFE.

Other P.M. meds address various stages of sleep; clonoapem=stage 1 or quieting down mind & trazadone helps me get deep sleep of which I was totally deprived (when hGH is suppose to be released) of as revealed in sleep study. I now actually fall asleep for more than 2 hr stretches (3-4 hrs now) and can get back to sleep (still need to refine regiment so I can get a normal nights sleep-of greatest importance for healing process).

"I think I summed this up when describing treatment benefits.  But I'd like to add here that much of my daytime difficulties arise from how quickly exhaustion sets in from the mildest activity, sometimes just walking across the room. On the rare days I can get out a run local errands I come back so exhausted & in pain, it causes me to avoid doing so as much as possible.  Another issue is low blood volume-which means low oxygen available so have sudden and very high lactic acid levels from climbing a few flights of stairs or anything that demands immediate demanding effort. Low O2 to brain leaves me faint and lose train of thought, confusion, high agitation from over sensory load-like the brain short circuits.

3425	tazorac	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anti-aging	I used this drug as an alternative to Retin A. In that regards it worked admirably.  Retin A users have a period of almost 3 months where there skin (usually face) is tremendously red.  Tazorac has little of this.  I only would only get this about every 7 days or so and was cured easily with hydrocortisone.	As above, the drug has similar side effects to Retin-A, exept for the fact that they are far less frequent and far less severe.  As above, this effect only occurred about every 7 days or so and was cured easily with hydrocortisone. However, the results were completely worth it, as it eliminated many wrinkles in my skin, and the texture it left behind was much more cosmetically appealing.	I purchased a full 60 gram tube.  It was like $10 with my insurance.  I would first wash my face with Neutogena deep facial cleaner.  After letting dry 30 minutes, I would start to apply the Tazorac.  I would dispemse a pea-shaped amount on my finger and then dab my my cheeks, near my eyes, my chin, and my forehead.  Then rub in.  After about another 30 minutes, I would place on moisturizer.

2458	ecotrin	8	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	pain	The treatment benefits from taking 300 milligrams of Bayer aspirin for headache pain were decreased pain. The positive effects for diminishing the pain were noticed in about half an hour to a full hour or so. The headache pain was nearly and sometimes even completely relieved with the Bayer. But, after a few hours or so, the pain would come back and I would have to take more of the drug.	No side effects were noticed.	The treatment would start as soon as pain was noticed. 300 milligrams of aspirin was taken for every headache episode.

3027	seroquel	4	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	anxiety	Helped relieve anxiety	Dizziness, moodiness, anger and agitation	At first the medication seemed to work wonders in a very short period of time (a few days).  After about a week I began to get extremely moody - crying a lot, getting very angry and agitated.

3821	estrasorb	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	menopausal hot flashes	Hot flashes were totally diminished.	None so far that I am aware of.	This product is a bio-identical cream rubbed onto the skin, containing 2.5 grams estradiol per package.  I was reluctant to take estrogen orally and this was a viable alternative.  The cream is rubbed into the thigh morning and evening for about 3 minutes.  Sunscreen is to be avoided in the area where the cream is applied since it can affect/prevent effective absorption.
708	accutane	10	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	acne	My acne went away. I had horrible cystic acne and it finally went away. It took a bit, but thats fine.	Extremely dry skin. Almost reptile like as i started the cycle. Really dry eyes and lips, had a problem wearing contacts.

Once done with pills I would come in a few times and have the vaccum facial that he had at the office. I loved that part!
23	alprazolam	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	In low doses, this drug does exactly what it says it does - reduces symptons of anxiety.  It is especially helpful for very anxiety-producing situations such as speaking in front of groups, flying, and going into crowded places.  The drug produces a feeling of being more relaxed, and in extremely high anxiety situations (flying), if I take the full dose of .5 mg, it will sleep and wake up with no residual effects.

667	erythromycin	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sinus infection	I was able to get rid of a nasty sinus infection that had been bothering me for over a week	I suddenly developed a rash across my stomach and itched for at least one - two hours after each dose.	"The doctor would prescribe Erythromycin for me every time I developed a sinus infection. (This had been going on since childhood). I would take a regimen of 4 tablets daily for a total of 7 days. I was also given Sudafed to help with the allergies I suffered from. Occassionally I was also given a saline solution to flush out my sinuses. The last time I was given this regimen however, I had an allergic reaction and began itching. I broke out in a rash within 45min. of taking the first dose. The doctor told us to ""keep an eye on it and if I had difficulty breathing or any other symptoms I was to rush to the ER."" Other wise he felt the symptoms to be within normal limits. I continued the regimen and was able to get rid of the infection but was given a different antibiotic the next time I got an infection."
405	restasis	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	dry eye	Considerably reduced dry eye and the uncomfortable itchyness that comes with dry eye.  Eye Doctor felt the dry eye was 80% better within 30 days.	There is sometimes a burning and blurred vision. The sides effect were mild and last only minutes.

1507	metoprolol	8	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	The benefits of taking this medication have been that my blood pressure is kept in a safe range.

2959	zyban	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	quit smoking	The treatment benefits were out of the window as i was prescribed to take diazepam whilst taking Zyban, Zyban advises you not to take Diazepam for instance as one of the contraindicated drugs.	I had experienced many profound side effects; starting with visual disturbances, sleeplessnes, weight loss, memory loss, major loss of appetite, irratable skin rashes, extreme anxiety, dehydration loss of motabilty & a severely nervous breakdown after three weeks resulting hospitallisation. I believe the damage caused is irreversable & would somehow like to know if anyone has came across anything like this in comparison & made any recovery.	The treatment details were to help you gradually stop smoking but the drug orders you to not smoke whilst taking the drug to the daily limit from up to two weeks, this is an illogical instruction as you might aswell of not taken the drug.
1252	catapres	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	(clonidine)It assisted in lowering my blood pressure by causing me to have a more voluminous (not more frequent)urination,when urged.Also,it aided in- depressing my agonizing hot flashes.They came at sequential intervals at time of menses and would last in that manner until completion of menses.Thereafter,they were intermitten daily.	If this is the side effect.It would be, soon after taking the meds,There is a timed-released drowsy effect that occurs,within a matter of 15-20 minutes.This is the only so-called side effect that I've experienced.But,I guess,it is a matter of where you are and what's on your agenda during this side-effect.	I'm not completely sure what to write here,that would consist of fifty words.I take (Clonidine)-0.1mg 1 tab twice daily and (Lisinopril/HCTZ)-20mgs.12.5  1tab,twice daily.I've learned to take them with food.Earlier,when introduced to these meds,upon attending a Drs. appointment and having my blood pressure checked,the reading would be high  and I felt no internal or external symptoms.The inquiry would be have you taken your meds? and I had.So,it was suggested that I try administering them with food.Thereafter,no more high readings and entered a normalized phase.
1075	combipatch	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	menopause symptoms	The benefits were to alleviate menopausal symptoms.  It did a very good job at that.

The hysterectomy was cancelled.	The patch was worn on the arm.
670	dyazide	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	general fluid retention	Completely controlled swelling.	There appeared to be no side effects.	Her doctor originally had prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg per day for her fluid retention. This held it for 6 months, then it's effectiveness lessened. We didn't want to double the dose as we were concerned with potassium loss. Instead we used this combination formula, which adds in the potassium sparing triamterene. This medicine has held her swelling completely in check for more than 8 months. We have monitored her liver function and mineral levels, and haven't noticed any problems.
1057	oracea	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	rosacea	I have had a mild case of blackheads and pimples since I was a child.

1049	elocon	6	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	dermatitis	Elocon is definetely a very effective drug for treating dermatitis.  It clears up the condition in 4 or 5 days.  See next for side effects.	"Eventhough Elocon is effective in treating dermatitis, if used for extended periods it can cause ""steroid induced rosacea"" and that can become difficult to treat as it does not clear up on its own."	After the dermatitis cleared up, I developed a rosacea that lasted for about 4 months.  I had to take oral antibiotics for an extended period of time to clear up the rosacea caused by the Elocon.  In summary, a very effective drug but must be used carefully and under strict medical supervision.
3381	lipitor	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	high cholesterol	I did not take the drug long enough to see any substantial beneficial effects	I developed terrible weakness and pain in bilateral knees. I went from being extremely active to being unable to walk up a flight of stairs. It felt as though my knees would crumble under me.By the second week, I could barely walk up more than 3 steps. My doctor took me off the medication immediately, but the effects lasted about 6 months.	My physician then tried a series of different medications for cholesterol. I was on Crestor, Simvastatin, and Zocor, all with the same side effect. My physician then ordered a lipid blood test to determine if the type of lipid found in my blood would promote cardiac disease, which thank goodness it didn't. I have a family history of elevated cholesterol: all the women in the family are on one of the cholesterol lowering medications: I am the only one in my family that experienced the above side effects.

Because of low sugar levels I always feel hungry and it gave me some relief as I didnt get hungry as often and when I ate, I couldnt eat as much, but I felt satisfied. I felt that the effects of the drug started to ware off after a few months but now I dont take it anymore as I have lost about 5 kilos and want to continue to lose another 5 through healthy controlled eating and exercise. I feel I can control my eating a bit better and realised that the overeating was creating the roller coaster ride, so I think the drug helped me mentally with portion control and now I tell myself as I have created the habbit with better eating habbits.
1705	retin-a-micro	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	uneven skin tone and wrinkle prevention	I only have mild acne but my skin improved even from that and I noticed more even, bright skin as I continued to use the product.  My skin also felt smoother and softer over time.	I have fairly sensitive skin and I only noticed the mild side effects that were listed.

Doctor prescribed one pill per day of Minocycline for my acne. Took the drug for 2 weeks. Then I had the swollen lips reaction and stopped taking the drug.
2971	niaspan	3	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	choloesterol	Initially, I was started on Niaspan 500 milligrams two times a day to lower my trigylcerides.  My level was over two thousand.  After three months, I went back to my primary care physician for follow-up blood work to check how I am responding to the treatment.  My trigyceride levels improved significantly but was not within normal limits. My triglyceride level was 503.	The side effect I experienced was moderate enough for me to contact my physician to ask for it to be changed.  My doctor told me to increase the dosage of Niaspan ER to two thousand milligrams every night.  For the first few days, I felt hot during the night and sweaty.  It was very uncomfortable, even if I had the airconditioning on.  After several days, I started having muscle pains on both my legs.  I was losing sleep becasue I was so uncomfortable and could no longer tolerate taking the medicine.  My physician then gave me the option of trying a new medication, or sticking to Niaspan ER but at a reduced dose.  I chose to stay with the same drug but at a reduced dose.  I now taker 1500 milligrams daily and do not feel any side effects.  I still need to go back to my doctor to see how this change affected my Triglycerides.

Joint aches, including hips, back, neck and jaw.	I stopped taking Fosamax against my doctor's wishes due to the side affects.  I am only 41 and it made me feel like I was 80 years old.

1837	yasmin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	Yasmin is the fourth birth control pill i've tried and the only one i haven't had to discontinue due to adverse physical and emotional side effects. While on Yasmin I experienced no weight gain or moodiness whatsoever. In addition to preventing pregnancy Yasmin helped to slightly decrease my anxiety levels without a feeling of mania or malaise as is often accompanied by the use of anti-depressants. The pill also seemed to help with breakouts associated with my monthly cycle.	I had to stop purchasing the drug because the cost was $60, even with a PPO insurance plan. It took six months for my cycle to re-acclimate after beginning the hormones.	Yasmin is a birth control pill I took once a day. I personally sought out a method of birth control that I could take with minimal side effects. I was prescribed the pill after I went to my doctor and asked her to prescribe it.
1777	citalopram	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	depression	I felt alot better about myself and not feeling depressed all of the time. Overall I do feel better about myself but I don't like the feeling from the side effects from this medication.	I had a bad headache, nausea, sudden feeling of cold sweats, insomnia, and stomach pain. I suggest that everyone that is going to take any depression medication, to seriously ask yourself if you even need it that bad because for me the side effects aren't worth taking the medication.	I am taking citalopram for depression. I do not advise anyone to take this medication at all. I am not a doctor but I know how this medication made me feel and its not good.
2087	anafranil	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	excessive fears	I could function normally again, after 6 weeks sick leave, I had a kind of a Burn-out.	In the first 2-3 month very dry mouth and heavy perspiration. These side effects disappeared after about 3 month.	"Started with anafranil 50mg once a day combined with oxazepam 10mg three times a day. Anafranil could make the fears worse the first to weeks they told me therefore I had to use oxazepam for 6 weeks. The first four weeks oxazepam 3 times a day 10mg, after that for 2 weeks I used oxazepam 10mg once a day. I have a medical profession and I knew the risks of oxazepam and wanted to stop with it as soon as possible. The first period I had a lot of side effects, dry mouth, have perspiration but it normalised after about 3 month. The first 3 months fear changed in almost fearless but this also normalised after 3 months. The rest of the time I used anafranil I had no side effects. I felt fine, however after 1 year I had to change physician because I moved. The new physician described Seroxat as he thought there was not only a fear issue but also a mild depression. I used Seroxat 20mg once a day for several weeks but did not feel ok�. I felt almost without any emotion. Not happy, not sad, nothing. I did not like that at all, I felt worse!! I went back to my physician and we came to a compromise. Once a day 10mg seroxat and once a day Anafranil 25mg. I used this combination for 6 months and I felt good. After 6 month I stopped the Seroxat and used the anafranil 25mg once a day for another 6 months.
I had also psychotherapy as well during these last 6 months. After that I felt ok� and stopped without any problems. I feel great now."
3441	tazorac	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	melasma	Smoother skin and even skin color are the most notable benefits. With continued use, I also noticed a greater firmness to my skin.

3603	retin-a	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anti aging	The benefits I saw from Retin-A were considerable compared to non prescription skin care. The fine lines especially around my eyes and cheeks diminished and were not as deep. My entire skin tone looked younger, more even toned and my large pores were much less noticeable and more refined. My skin looked much healthier and it looked more soft focus. It took a few months to notice a measurable difference.	The main side effects I had while using Retin-A were drier,flaky skin.	When I started using Retin-A I started with the lower strength prescription to aviod side effects while my skin was acclimating to Retin-A. I started with Retin-A .025% strength every other night. After cleansing I wait 20 to 30 minutes and then apply the Retin-A. After another 30 minutes I apply a moisturizer if needed over the Retin-A. After about 2 months I switched to the next higher strength Retin-A which is .05%. I was much more senstive to this strength so I started using it once every 3 nights to start doing the same as above, waiting 20 to 30 minutes after cleansing to apply. Once my skin tolerated this routine after about a month without flakiness I went to every other night. I now can use Retin-A .05% every night but occasionally when I start to see any dryness or skin flaking I will skip a night to give my skin a rest. I love my results. Retin-A is the only skin care I've used where I have noticed a considerable difference in the amount of sun damage that has been repaired. My skin is much more healthy looking and more refined.
1074	combipatch	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	menopause	Patient complaints prior to drug were menopause related. Inability to sleep, hot flashes, night sweats, lack of concentration (which may have been intensified by lack of sleep), loss of elasticity in the skin. Although the use of the patch has not helped improve my skin (I didn't expect it to) almost immediately sleep was restored, night sweats stopped, and concentration ability returned, although not as completely as pre-menopause.	"The package insert warns of serious side effects such as breast cancer, cancer of the uterus, stroke, heart attack, blood clots and dementia. I had been one determined to go through menopause without the use of any hormones. However, after trying every over the counter, holistic, and wives tale cure for 5 years with no success, I wanted RELIEF. After consulting every possible option, weighing the side effects of each one carefully, the CombiPatch was the one settled upon.  
    I am pleased to say I haven't had one side effect of the drug beyond a sticky spot left by the patch's adhesive. Granted, it has only been 6 months since beginning treatment but the benefits and quality of daily life restored have far outweighed the risks."	It is, to my understanding, the smallest dosage available at 50/250 and my doctor suggested I even try applying once, rather than twice per week to see if that was enough to handle my symptoms. It was. The patch is so easy. I only have to remember once per week to change it. And on the rare occasion I forget, the patch loses some of its stickiness and reminds me! Honestly, for any woman truly suffering from constant problems like mine and don't fall into a high risk category, I would wholeheartedly recommend the patch.

61	flexeril	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine/tension headaches/sleep	Well, It made me relaxed during the day, and sometimes be able to be calm. It helped my headaches a lot. I would rate it as a 9 or 10. I would recommend this drug definately!	Dry mouth and sometimes restless legs.	I was to take 10mg three times a day for headaches as needed. My doctor said if it works, I can stay on it. I recently decided to get off narcotics and this is a good medicine to take.
548	propranolol	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	Complete calming effect very quickly,stops the vicious cycle from physical symtoms back to thoughts in the mind that start it all over again,Exellent drug and highly recomended.For me it made my impossible life possible again but give your body time to ajust to the drug.

1007	darvocet-n	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	arthritic joint pain/carpal tunnel	affording daily movement and ability to continue to perform daily household duties, employment, and still afford me ability to enjoy activities with husband and grandchildren.	Some stomach discomfort and mild queasiness but I found taking 1/2 tablets at a time with ample fluids usually alleviated problems.	carpal tunnel from job related injury and arthritis degeneration of my vertebrae requires daily regimine for pain and movement. Several medications tried such as ibruprofin, allieve, demoral etc caused many unpleasent and intolerable side effects. The Darvocet taken 1/2 tablet 4-6 times daily works perfectly as nearly can be expected. I also do not experience any bothersome toxicity or effectiveness problems as I generally would afford myself time-out days allowing my system a break from routines. I believe without this medication life would be greatly less enjoyable and my abilities to participate in a positive manner would be extremely limited.
2383	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hashimotos syndrome - hypothyroid symptoms	Synthroid replaces the thyroid hormones not manufactured by the body. When proper levels are achieved, the endocrine system operates as it should. Important to note that generic versions CAN NOT be substituted if patient is currently treated with name brand.

134	valtrex	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	herpes zoster	The medication stops the pain and puts an end to the condition if taken soon enough	I felt fatigued but this could be just a symptom of the condition.	I had little spots (blisters unbeknownst to me) on the side of my face which itched and burned terribly. This was about the size of a quarter.  I thought I had some sort of insect bite and just ignored it until it got worse and I felt so tired and sick that I went to the dr.  He took a culture but at that point he didn't think there was anything to test but prescribed Valtrex.  I took it immediately and within a day felt relief.  After a couple of days I felt a million times better.  I have had one or 2 re-occurances over the last 10 years and I make sure I always have Valtrex on hand just in case.  It is a terrible condition and I am thankful for Valtrex as it seems to stop it in its tracks.
1430	adipex-p	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	weight loss	I've been taking for a little over a week. This med suppresses my appetite so much that I have to remind myself to eat and have absolutely no desire for food if I don't eat. I can already tell that I've lost inches and pounds, but I haven't been on the scale to see exactly how much yet. I have only been exercising moderately, although the feeling of energy is incredible and makes me get up and do everything!!! My doctor was cautious in giving to me because of my high blood pressure, but fortunately my BP meds have my condition well under control, so I just keep track of my daily reading to ensure there are no spikes. I feel like this really works so far!	"I've read the side effects, but honestly, I can't say that I've experienced more than a couple of mild headaches and feeling that slight ""elated"" feeling. I already experience night sweats & some insomnia due to menopause, so I can't tell a difference in those categories."	I have a 30-day supply and based on what I've read about the addiction, I have not decided if I will continue beyond a 90-day regimen.
2934	prednisolone	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	allergy reaction on the face incl swollen face	It reduced 90% the swelling in the face over 2 days. On the 3rd morning, I did not take prednisolone but went back to see the doctor as I was afraid of side effects. The doctor agreed that it was ok to stop taking the medication.	None occurred while I took the medication for 2 mornings. However, it is known that prednisolone may cause osteoporosis, pigmentation, etc in the long run.	I was prescribed 30mg of prednisolone (6 tablets of 5mg each) every morning for 4 mornings. However, after taking 30mg for 2 mornings, the swelling in the face reduced by about 90%. On the 3rd morning, I did not take prednisolone but went back to see the doctor as I was afraid of side effects. The doctor agreed that it was ok to stop taking the medication.
3546	vivelle-dot	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	menopause	BIO estrogen is the only prescription med I take. I'm in good health other than some pesky osteoarthritis in my finger joints and hips.  I eat pretty well and keep my weight within a healthy norm (fluctuates about 10 lbs over a year back and forth depending on how hard I try). Had good blood test results about a year ago - low blood pressure, everything within the normal range for my age.	The only side effects that I am aware of are the positive ones - keeping my skin from being overly dry, lack of menopausal symptoms (mostly). This patch has been a godsend for me, but I had my uterus removed in my 30s due to excessive bleeding, so I am not at risk for uterine cancer. There is no history of breast cancer in my immediate family (grandmothers/mother/sister)	Started out on a .1 mg patch and worked down to a .075 patch.... doc wanted me to go lower, but when I do I get some night sweats and can tell the difference so I am staying on the .075 = my hormone levels in my blood are normal for a woman my age on HRT.
3049	seroquel	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	bipolar disorder	Well, in a technical sense it helped with the bipolar disorder, but the side effects were terrible enough that I could not continue with the medication.	While taking this med, along with the others listed, I couldn't think inside of my own head. During the time I took this medication, I had no emotional reations to anything, even things that I should have. I felt like a zombie the whole time. I've been off the medication for a few years now, but from that period of time, I only have 2 memories.	I took 200 mg of seroqeul in the morning and before bed; 1000 mg of depakote morning, afternoon, and night, and 10mg risperdol morning, afternoon, and night. Most of the side effects are probably becuase I should never have been taking that many medications at once and the ammount of them, but that is how they were prescribed to me.
3494	acanya	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	cystic acne	"Acanya Gel treated cystic acne, blackheads, whiteheads, and any inflamed acne on my face. The water-based/fragrance-free gel did not cause ant stinging or burning.
Within in a month, my face is completely clear of all acne. Scars have also faded and smoothed out."	Dryness, slight redness and a small amount of peeling.	The combination of clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide is used to treat acne.  The combination of clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide works by killing the bacteria that cause acne.
2608	adderall-xr	4	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	add	To treat add.  To releave sudden impulsive behavor.  To help me focus on things that I had to do.  To help me retain information that I was studing in school.  To help me stop putting things off that were important for me to finish.  To help improve my relationships.	I found that some of the side effects were very severe.  I would have compulsive sexual desires that I had never had before and wanted sex with my husband all the time.  I had great difficulty sleeping so I would take melatonin to go to sleep every night.  I would talk very fast as well as move fast.  I would have hand tremers.  I also had very dry mouth and diarrhea.	I woke up every morning a took 1 20mg tab with a full glass of water.  Then, throughout the day I would have to make myself drink water and eat.  I had lost all desire to eat or drink until around 8 or 9pm that day.  I would have obsessive thoughts and couldn't stop working on something until it was finished.  This meant even if I really needed to stop and do something else I couldn't.  I called my doctor and explained this and he switched me to adderall 10mg without extended release.  This has been much better.  However, I still have some obsessive behavor.  I have never been dx or tx for OCD.
1826	yasmin	5	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control	Convenience, skin cleared up, effective birth control	cleared my skin but I lost all desire for sex.	"This was my first foray into the Pill. After about 5 months I realized I just never got ""horny"" anymore and rarely even thought about having sex, much to my boyfriend's dismay. But my skin did look much better so I continued on. But once the relationship ended (not caused by my low desire, btw) I decided to go off of it and get a cervical cap. My sex drive returned but so did my bad skin. I am now (8 years later) giving it another go with Apri, solely for my skin b/c I really like my cervical cap, which unfortunately they stopped making."
2597	phenergan	2	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	nausea	Phenergan was given to combat nausea due to chemotherapy. Was given one pill in the ER to try and stop vomiting. It did ease the nausea a bit.	It made me feel like I couldn't sit still even though I was very weak from constant vomiting. I felt like I had bugs crawling all over my legs. I also had to keep moving my legs.	One pill was given by mouth with water to ease nausea and vomiting. After about 20 minutes the side effects started.
4081	mobic	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	severe wrist pain	"I allowed my wrist pain to continue untreated by a physician for a month. With a brace and this medication it is improving. The greatest gift was that my chronic lower back pain has virtually disappeared!I have lived with constant low to medium grade pain (depending on activity level) for YEARS, and something takes that away...me body hasn't felt this ""at ease"" in years!I only pray that when my wrist is better and I insist on going to half strength, it will continue to ease my back pain."	None I can't live with!!!!!!!!! SLIGHT quizy stomach (and I have always taken it with food).	I am to go back to orthopedic surgeon in 2 weeks (I thought I had carpal tunnel- but it was arthritis). At that time hopefully my wrist will be better and I can lower dosage to 7 1/2mg.
3513	minoxidil	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hair loss	Dying follicles were reactivated and enlargened so large terminal hairs grew. Vellus hairs were shed and replaced with strong hairs. Hair thickened substantially	'Peach fuzz' vellus hair growth on my forehead and cheekbones. Dizziness when started using at first. Increased heart rate when first started using. Possible skin damage - minoxidil breaks down collagen.	The recommended application is 1ml twice daily. I ended up applying 4ml once daily for over a year. So, I was using too much. The results were pretty amazing.
720	accutane	6	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	I had to wait quite a few month before Accutan had started to work but by the end of the treatment my skin was like a babies. Not oily at all even my pores shrank and there was no acne on my face. The down side was that after not taking the medicine any more after a couple of month with great skin the acne has started to come back.	Extensive dryness on the lips and skin.	I have taken two tabless every day for half year.
1744	topamax	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	ocd	"Although Topamax is an anti-epileptic, which is more commonly perscribed for the treatment of migrains...it had a substancial benefit to my OCD symptoms.  It significantlly reduced my desire (or calling) to repeat (recheck, recount, retouch) items, which was a huge issue for me.  In the past, it would take me hours to complete the most mundane tasks, but with the Topamax, I can more easily ""let go"" of certain rituals and walk away feeling ""complete"" without having to repeat them countless times..."	I experienced some mild loss of appetite early on, which graduly disappaited.	"I statrted on 50mg, than a week later went upto 100mg. I stayed on 100mg for about a year. It wasn't until a year later that I went up to 200mg and have been on this dose for over 2 years. I experience no side effects. My mind feels quiter and I feel freeer than I ever had in my life. I am not on any other medication nor am I seeking ""talk"" therapy for my OCD. The Topamax has been able to keep it at a tolerable level.

I also must note that in the way past I was on Prozax, Paxil, Celexa, Luvox, Valium, Xanax, Clozapam...all with little or no success."
1779	citalopram	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	panic disorder and anxiety	Made my panic attacks less frequent and less intense. Sometimes felt happy for no reason, in a good way, which helped alleviate some of my anxiety and stopped my worrying so much.	Tingling and burning sensations, insomnia, constantly hot, dizzy, feeling faint, feeling emotional, needing to pee often, racing heart - these occurred at different intensities and at different times. They sound bad, but they are much easier to cope with than my condition before I took the tablets.	?

780	naproxen	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	tendonitis of the foot, specifially big toe	The Naproxin has reduced the tendonitis pain enough to allow me to continue my work waitressing.	I haven't noticed any side effects.	"I saw my MD for painful tendonitis I was feeling under the center of my foot and on through my big toe. Sometimes my toes would cramp up painfully. She prescribed the Naproxen and shoe insoles (called ""Super Feet""). I've been taking the medication for a week and so far, it's been quite helpful, although I still experience moderate pain after working a shift (I waitress)."
4043	amoxil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	strep  throat	the drug worked usually by the second dose.  My daughter was up and around and feeling better immediatley it seemed.  It had no side effects that she ever had.  She could either take it on a full tomach or empty one.	There were no side effects that she ever had.	I woudl give her a pill 3 times daily.  She would take it right before school, right afterschool and then right before bedtime.  It was easy to swallow and didn't amke her tired or sleepy, so she was able to function at school.  It seemed to work tight away usually within the first day of treatment.  It was great!!
1437	tirosint	5	Ineffective	No Side Effects	fatigue, weight gain, depression	I have not noticed any benefits so far.  My weight has remaind the same.  The depression has not gotten noticeably better, and fatigue continues to be a problem.	I have not noticed any side effects thus far.  I've been on the Synthroid for only 4 weeks, so it may not yet be at its full effectiveness.  I've also just found out I should take it on an empty stomach and then wait an 30 min. to and hour prior to eating for it to be 100% effective.	I am taking the Synthroid to increase metabolism, stop weight gain, help with depression, and to reduce fatigue.  I have been complaining of chronic fatigue for 10 years, and the depression has been an issue for about the same length of time.  The weight gain has occurred within the last 3 years and was significant (for me) within the last two years.  My primary physician told me that my levels were within range; however, the NP I work for (a mental health nurse practitioner)reviewed the levels for depression and found the my levels were just below the norm, enough to make a difference.
2634	depo-provera	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	severe pms and menstrual pain	No more painful debilitating monthly cycles, complete with life destroying rollercoaster like mood swings.  Seems to work great for people with these particular problems (my sister has amenorrhea and had a horrible reaction, the never ending monthly cycle).  For me it�s life altering.  I actually kept a job for 8 years instead of two months.  I can not imaging my life without taking the depot injection.  I only wish I could learn more about why this balance of hormones actually helped with what seemed to be a debilitating mental disorder, and could slight alterations help with my depression (which I had well before I ever took this drug)	I do not experience any side effects while on the depot, but if I do not take it on time, I have some mild side effects untill I recieve my injection.  I took the generic form for 6 months but noticed some undesireable changes to my mood (more anxious and irritable).  Despite the more favorable price I will never take the generic again.	One injection every three month.  Yearly exam and occasional bone density test.  I eat or supplement approximately 1,800 I.U. vitamin D and 1,500 mg calcium. Weight training at least 3x a week.

2961	zyban	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	to quit smoking	none	My side effects were severe depression, and alteration in personality.  Do not take this drug, the side effects can be severe.  I had no previous issues with depression, and as soon as I started taking this drug, I developed severe depression, and changes in my personality.  Thankfully, my family noticed a change, and advised me and told me to stop taking Zyban.  It took 2 years to overcome the depression and over 3 years to begin to feel like myself again.  Stay away from this drug!  If you want to quit smoking, butt out and stick to your guns.  I quit, and it wan't the Zyban.  I have been smoke free for 10 years, and depression free for 7 or 8.  Someone should consider a class-action suit against the company which produces this drug.  Based on other reviews I have seen, I am not the only one who had these side effects.	I took this drug to quit smoking.  I am a female and was 28 years old at the time.
2074	metformin	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	prevention of diabetes	weight loss was the major benefit of approximately 8-10 pounds.  it also improved my LDL and HDL cholesterol and also triglycerides.  my hemoglobin a1c also improved.  my fasting blood sugar only marginally improved.  pulse and blood pressure stayed the same.	mild gi upset when first started the drug with some diarrhea, but these side effects dissipated after approximately two months of use.	took 500 mg twice a day with virtually no side effects, except could not tolerate any doses higher than that because of gi upset.  continue to take it without a problem.
3058	oxycodone	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	severe back pain resulting from a herniated disc	Reduced pain almot always, except when severe spasims occured.

2420	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypothyroidism	I had increased stamina, anemia went away, heavy menses improved from anemia being treated.  My hair grew thicker as much of it had fallen out.  My dry skin was much improved.  I had a huge improvement in clarity of thought.  My tongue seemed previously swollen and I could enunciate much more effectively.	Getting the proper dose was tricky.  If dose was too high, my pulse rate skyrocketed.  If the doctor reduced my dose too quickly my hair would start to thin.	Once yearly testing of TSH. One tablet per day.
196	adderall	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	add/adhd	ability to stay awake, focus, do daily household chores, run needed errands & helped my organizational skills as far as bills	dry mouth. sometimes slight headaches, but not completely sure if its just from medicatation or being tired as i do have a very busy schedule,	i was prescribed 60 tablets of 20 mg. he told me to experiment myself as to what dosage worked for me, not exceeding 2 whole pills daily. normally i take one whole pill in the morning at 6:30-7 @ 1/2 at 12 and 1/2 before work at 4 pm. sometimes on the weekend i'll only take 1 because i try to have extras in case needed at another time & i dont want to build up tolerance
939	levaquin	1	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	pneumonia	Respiratory symptoms markedly improved	My joints appeared to lock. I had difficulty ambulating and moving my arms for a few days. It was severe. I could not rise from a chair.	About 5 years ago I had a serious recurring respiratory infection. I could not shake it, so my doctor - after using Augmentin and Septra, put me on Levaquin. The first course went well, with rapid resolution of my symptoms, but a few weeks later when the symptoms returned and I was given a second course of Levaquin, I began to have joint aches and pains which I attributed to my illness. By day 3 I could not rise from a chair. Both my mother and a close friend have had bad side effects as well. After treatment with Levaquin for 4 days, my mother began hallucinating and then had a heart attack and stroke, My friend has severe intractable pain which requires methadone for relief - after 1 course of drug.
2720	elavil	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	temporomandibular joint disorder (tmj)	Helped relax muscles in face, thereby relieving TMJ and reducing pain.	Dry mouth, nervousness, dizziness.  Also negative as it was given as a long term pain management solution, it reduced my pain but still needed to be used along-side pain-killers.  If stopping and has been taken for a long time slowly ween off (unlike myself) as caused me to have sweats, aches and pains and lethargy (flu-like symptoms) for a number of days.	50 mg at bedtime.
1277	provigil	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	ms-related fatigue	Taking the provigil has allowed me to keep working fulltime; otherwise I wouldn't be able to function well due to the extreme constant fatigue I experience related to MS. My neurologist suggested I try this.  It has helped considerably during the daytime with my concentration level and also has helped me to stay focused.	Provigil works well for an approximate 3 hr. period, but wears off shortly after that. I do experience slight rapid heartbeat initially and feel jittery for a short time but it goes away quickly. I currently take 100 mg. and if needed, another 100 mg. in the afternoon.  I don't take this any time after 2 pm as I'll be up all night.  I do need to take a prescribed sleeping pill in order to get to sleep since I've been on Provigil.	I initially started on 200 mg. daily and have cut back as I do have trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep.  I have been on this for 7 months and the effectiveness of Provigil is at the same level today as it was when I began.
3454	tamiflu	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	h1n1	I would have rather endured the flu. this was an experience like no other for me. i was out of work and unable to care for my child. not recommended unless life threatening illness.	vomiting, stomach cramps, headache, dizziness, anxiety, nosebleeds, overall feeling of uneasiness/panic	h1n1 positive in hospital, 5 days 2x daily
118	valtrex	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	herpes	Was taking this drug for herpes suppression.  It is recommended by some to take an antiviral for one year after the initial outbreak so as to have less outbreaks over one's lifetime.  I did get an outbreak while on the drug, however it was during a very stressful time so that is understandable.  Also, it is nice that only one dose is needed per day for most people.	Side effects included mild hair loss (had much more hair loss on acyclovir), random dry heaving (retching) for no apparent reason, and headaches.  Although it seems that when I drink lots of water the headaches are fewer.	Took one pill per day at the same time everyday.  It does and will stain things so be careful of the blue dye.
1913	avelox	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	sinus infection	none apparent	Over the course of three nights, within an hour or two of first taking it, I had heart palpitations, confusion, inability to concentrate, problems balancing, extreme tiredness, lasting muscle weakness, nightmares and sleeplessness, anxiety, rash, a sureness I was dying and not even caring! I have never had a reaction to any drugs, and I am furious that a drug like this would even be on the market.	I think my doctor was very irresponsible to prescribe this antibiotic without first having me try something else. I am now taking Clarithromycin and am doing fine with this drug. The mental side effects of Avelox have now disappeared, five days later, but I am still very weak and my joints hurt.
600	risperdal	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	anxiety	NONE AT ALL	See below	An old and STUPID psychiatrist in Asha Hospital, Hyderabad had put me on Risperidone 2 mg, Pacitane 2 mg from past 2 years as I was suffering with anxiety and social phobia. I do not have any symptoms of Schizophrenia nor Bopolar disorder and I stopped taking the med since 4 months worrying about the serious side effects..The result is..it just RUINED my life in every aspect. I can't feel ANYTHING. I feel nothing in my brain..unable to sense pleasure..lost my unique nature..lost my personality and identity..not getting any thoughts..consciousness is reduced..not able to concentrate on any particular thing..unable to form clear ideas..difficulty understand simple things..chronic sleeplessness..stiff muscles..numbness on the hands..weight gain..sensory loss..memory shot..hearing is badly damaged..dim and blurred vision...no sexual desire at all and lot more..My FUCKING psychiatrist doesn't even let me know of these siide effects and just told me to continue the medication for two years and no need to consult him..I never know why he had put me on Risperidone.This med is really FUCKING..I never suggest this med to anyone at all and I want to file the lawsuit against the company who manufactured this ROGUE drug with these many dangerous and life threattening side effects.I will report to FDA, United States to put it in block list and RUIN their business completely.They are playing with the valuable lives of the patients with their stupid formulas and creating the FUCKING drugs..Do they bring back the life to normal once the brain got permanently damaged????
227	wellbutrin-xl	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	post trauma depression	Taking Wellbutrin has reduced my depression 8 fold.  I was better able to cope with every day decisions, events that stressed me with out crying or having angry episodes.  My moods have become stabilized since about a month after the start of taking this medicine.	I tried two other medications prior to using Wellbutrin and was quite pleased!  I had mild dry mouth for about a month and actually lost the weight i gained from prior meds and a bit more.  I still have shaking hands but it is not any worse than a cup of coffee.  I have found that my tolerance to alcohol has increased, and lately my lower back has been hurting in the area of my kidneys, but i also have lower back spasms so i could be projecting worry that the combination of Wellbutrin and wine are doing major damage to my liver and kidneys!	I started taking 150mg of Wellbutrin from April 15 to 30 in 2005 and then increased to 300mg.  I tried to take 450mg about a year ago because I felt the medicine did not seem to be working as well, but I wound up not benefiting from that dose.  I also tried to add Lexapro and gained so much weight I had to stop that medicine. I was given a generic version for about a month and I believe the pills were expired or tainted because the smelled rancid and my behavior patterns went haywire!

2391	synthroid	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroid	Increased energy; I happened to be without the drug for one week, and felt absolutely terrible - like I was completely knocked down.	no side effects that i can remember.	The doctor ran a series of blood/chemical tests - thyroid, testosterone and DHEA levels. All were somewhat low, the synthroid in particular. We've started out with fairly low levels of each.
322	ativan	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	ease breathing/fast heart rate	I was a post cardiac ablation patient with breathing difficulty from reactive airway disease (RADS) and a fast heart rate. Docs prescribed Ativan 1 mg per day to ease breathing. It did help ease feelings of suffocation.	Tried to stop taking 1 mg of Ativan per day after 10 days and had horrible withdrawal symptoms including blurred vision, shakiness, weakness, heightened sense of smell, nausea. Sick as a dog. Had to go to a rehab specialist to get weaned off.	Treatment to get off Ativan was to take .25 off per week for several weeks.
1929	zithromax	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	avod bacterial infection	The treatment benfits were to heal bacteria from surgery.  I was told to take the pills immediately starting the day after surgery.	side effects were diahrrea, stomach pain and nausea	the treatment was 1 pill a day for 4 days - first day 2 pills.  The pills were easy to take and remember
2421	synthroid	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	increased energy, depression gone	none	i was diagnosed with underactive thyroid in 1996.  i initially went to the doctors for swollen sinuses and being tired alot.  after testing me for underactive thyroid i was prescribed 25 mcg of synthroid.  the doctor then continued to increase the dose until i got to the appropriate level.  this took quite awhile, but i felt much better after the correct level was achieved.  my depression lifted and i had alot more energy.  overall i have been very pleased with Synthroid.
3423	tazorac	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	wrinkles, brown spots	less noticable fine lines and blotchiness. skin appeared clearer and smoother. in addition skin appeared plumper. The brown spots would be less noticable as long as I was using the cream consistantly.	dry peeling skin, redness. once you stopped using it the blotchiness returned and brown spots returned. I needed to wear alot of sunscreen on my hand after using it on that area because it rendered those areas vulnerable to sun exposure. also while driving I had to wear gloves which blocked sun rays to my hands.	used from a tube mainly at night. Used a pea size amount on each hand and one pea size amount on the face. Used over the lip line and on fine lines under the eye.
1001	armour-thyroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hyhpothyroidism	weight loss, increased energy, better outlook on life, decreased anxiety, no longer have panic attacks, no longer feel depressed and in general feel happy and more content with life. My energy level has sky rocketed and my ability to be mentally focused is much better. My TSH went from 6.29 to .6. My T3 and T4 uptake are within the normal ranges.	I did not have any treatment side effects.	I went in for a routine check up and mentioned feeling tired and anxious and asked if I could have my hormone levels checked. It turned out that I had hypothyroidism. I was given a choice of Synthroid or Armour thyroid. Based on everything that I had read I wanted to try the Armour. I started on 30 mg. and after about 6 months increased to 45 mg. Every 3-6 months I've had blood work and my TSH level has steadily dropped each time to my current level of .6. I feel better than I have in years. The difference in my mental outlook and energy is incredible. I also avoid soy products, products with fluoride and wait about 2 hours before eating after I take my medicine because I have read that doing these things are beneficial in making the treatment more effective.
1422	adipex-p	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	weight loss	I have always tried to lose 20-30 pounds and had no luck.  A friend of mine used Adipex (Phentermine) and lost 40 pounds in 4 months so I had to try it.  I started taking it last October 08 and by Christmas I had to buy all new pants because my other ones were WAY too big.  Total I lost 25 pounds and am now 130. I just started taking it again after being off of it for 3 months because I didnt want to get too addicted which I know you can from this drug, and you also build up an immunity to it, which I also did. Overall though, it definitely works to loose weight, my sister-in-law, my best friend, and my sister all took it and my sister lost the least so far(only been on it for 1 month) with 15 pounds.	Bad trouble sleeping. WIll fall asleep after a little trouble, but cannot stay asleep, wake up several times a night unable to get good rest. Have to take sleep aide with this drug or wont sleep at all! Also have bad to mild headache for first week or so, goes away after a while.  Mood swings are absolutely noticable, ups and downs. I NEVER noticed where my appetite was decreased at all, actually makes my stomache growl about 1/2 hour after taking it, nor did I have any extra energy ever, although somehow I DID lose weight on this pill.	I take 1/2 pill in morning before breakfast and other 1/2 lunch time.
3428	tazorac	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	I noticed a significant improvement in my acne.	I had painfully dry, irritated, and red skin for several months, as well as higher susceptibility to sunburn and visibly peeling, flaky skin... those first few months were the worst period of treatment. After a while, however, all the symptoms except for the peeling skin and sun sensitivity diminished.	I applied a pea-sized amount of Tazorac cream once a night before bed, starting in my freshmen year in high school. I've been using Tazorac ever since (five years or so) because of the positive skin effects it's supposed to have.
2535	lamisil	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	toe-nail fungus	Although it is essential to take the medication for the full 90 days, after one week I noticed that the skin on my affected foot was looking much better. I had years of tough, thick, dry, flaky skin on my heel and pads under my toes. As each week passed, this condition continued to improve. Almost from day one I did not experience any itchy toes or feet. At the end of the 90 days, I could see healthy nails growing up from the cuticle, although it will take several more months for the entire toe-nail on each affected toe to grow long enough that I can cut away the damaged nail.	"The first few days (maybe three)of taking the drug I was a bit headachy and then experienced some mild stomach upset. After that, I was fine with no further issues.
A positive side effect was that after the treatment was over I noticed that the skin on my legs was very smooth. Previously I had rough, scaly skin which I just thought was dry skin, though I could never rid myself of it. But I guess it was part of the whole problem because now the skin is beautiful."	"I had been having regular doctor check-ups and am healthy.

During the 90 days, I was told to take the drug once per day and to also use lamisil cream on my feet every day.
About mid-way through, the doctor ordered a test for my liver, which came out fine.
Once the treatment was complete, my doctor suggested that I take one pill every month and use the cream on my feet twice per week."
3662	effexor-xr	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	mild to moderate depression	Improved mood after trying several other SSRI's. Had tried Prozac and Wellbutrin and got no effect from them. I was able to function better. I was not ecstatic, but was functional and less prone to negative thinking.	a bit of feeling dull or neutral.	Maximum dosage indicated in literature is 150 mg per day.  Took two 75 mg capsules in the morning with breakfast. The medication started to work within two or three days.  However, it's expensive. I would not say that I am non-functional without it, but I believe I am more functional when taking it.
3644	retin-a	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acne/dull skin	Cleared up my acne and brightened my skin overall; slightly reduced fine lines.  Aside from acne, it seemed to help my skin in general.  This is by far the best acne treatment I've used.  Now I use it for overall skin appearance (not just for acne).	"Thinning of skin leaves more sun sensitivity. Also, it cleared my acne, but didn't seem to ""treat"" it - if I stop using it, my acne comes back within a few weeks."	Very easy - simply applied a pea-sized amount every other night before bed.
921	paxil	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	panic attacks	I have been on Paxil or generics for 9 years after a life-time of panic attacks. My attacks subsided immediately and though they recur every so often the relief has been a godsend. Even as a highly-productive and involved person it has been a lifetime of quiet fear that at any moment I would have these horrific feelings of losing my self and being depersonalized out of my body. As a few others have noted, the most common location for instant attacks is while driving. Paxil has calmed much of my life-long anxiety. I am a calmer and more socially comfortable person.	Lots of side effects, none of them deal breakers. It took months to achieve orgasm - it was like having a dead weight between my legs. Having reduced treatment to 10mgs a few years ago that has improved. As many others report, wild dreams and less deep sleep is now the norm but I have long grown accustomed to it. Miss a dose and you get those weird 'electric' buzz shocls in your brain - a tad alarming but not horrible. Weight increase of about 10 pounds - very difficult to get rid of.	Started at 10 mg on doctor's recommendation, went to 20 after a month. Noticable improvement in mood and lessened anxiety. After 4-5 years weaned myself down to 10 mg by cutting the pills. With doctor ok have stayed at 210 for the last 6 years. Once i tried to reduce it to 5 mg - big mistake. Too big a jump and had terrible anxiety. Decided I could live with 10 mg. It works, but with side effects. Like all powerful medicine, it's a tradeoff. For me it is still worth it 10 years later.
4069	mobic	7	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	arthritis	It seemed to help with the joint inflamation. Some swelling of ankles was reduced and I didn't seem as achey. I tried several sample medications first like celebrex but I liked the Mobic best. I have not gone off of it since I started to really know if it makes a difference.	none	Took one 30mg tab a day.
3230	nuvaring	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	Prevention of pregnancy. I used to insert in my vagina the nuvaring and I had my period just in time. I always knew what day my period was coming.	Headaches..cramping..nausea...dizzines	One ring once a month. I had to keep the ring for three weeks in my vagina and then take it out to get my period three days after. I had to insert a new ring in the fourth week.
583	acyclovir	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	hsv1	Immediately ameliorated symptoms and extremely efficacious when used prophylactically	Occasional mild gastrointestinal irritation when using a high dose (4000 mg)	I take 800 mg of acyclovir at the first sign of tingling along lips or tip of nose. I've found this prophylactic approach to be most efficacious if I dose at 800 mg for a day or two subsequently. In doing so, I've reduced hsv1 outbreaks from one a month to one a year. If I do get an outbreak, I dose 4000 mg per day (800 mg apprx every 2-3 waking hours) for four days then taper to 800 to 1600 mg per day for two to three more days with excellent results. If I begin dose after an outbreak has initiated, it is immediately arrested from worsening though it still will go through it's viral cycle remaining at a very small scale as long as I continue treatment as described above.
226	wellbutrin-xl	10	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	Marked adjustment in level of depression within one month. Continued benefits through following years of usage.	No side effects were experienced.	Wellbutrin XL was used in conjunction with talk therapy to great effect. Dosage has been maintained over the years with frequency of talk therapy decreasing and alleviation of depression has been maintained.
4093	asmanex	8	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	asthma	It works great, no asthma symptoms.	But I'm loosing a lot of hair, there's mild  pain in my lungs and legs on a regular basis and  mouth infections.	I'm was diagnosed with asthma  around six months ago  after getting pneumonia that lasted 3 months. I did have allergies before but never  any asthma symptoms.
17	proquin-xr	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	recurrent pseudomonas chest infection	Improved exercise tolerance. Stopped coughing up blood. Improvement in chest pain.	Nausea, bad dreams, very prone to sunburn. For the antibiotic to be effective I need to take a relatively large dose for my size (50kgs). Have to take anti-nausea medication while on the course of antibiotic otherwise tend to lose weight.	Have had repeated courses of this antibiotic over several years. Sometimes it works and other times it doesn't but the infection always recurs within a few weeks of stopping the treatment.
3069	oxycodone	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	back pain	Drug did take away pain quickly; easy to take, not contraindicative with muscle relaxers or codeine allergy.	No pain but very loopy.. Drug made patient incoherent and confused; bad memory and constipation patient had crazy ideas.	Take for pain, 2 pills every 3-4 hours, no more than 8 in 24 hours.
636	seasonique	1	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	to prevent pregnancy	4 periods a year	The first week that I took this pill, I felt like I had the flu.  I had to take a sick day off from work because I felt so sick: headache, constantly feeling hot and cold, extreme tiredness.  I also started breaking out a lot and my skin started to be so dry.  My husband also has said that I've had some mood swings as well.	"I stopped taking the pills today.  I hope this will stop all the symptoms.  I will probably never take any birth control for the rest of my life.  I was on Depo for about 2 years, which was fine--no major side effects except for the decreased sex drive.  I was on Ortho Tri Cyclen for about a year before Depo, but I stopped because I definitely got lighter periods but the periods were longer (5 days) than when I was not on any BC (3 days).
I shouldn't have been on any BC to begin with.  Afterall, I shouldn't complain--my periods are always on time like clock work.  No cramps, only the occasional bloating.  I started to be on BC to prevent pregnancy, but I'll just be more careful by using a condom instead."
2002	vicodin	3	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	tendonitis pain	I took vicodin for pain in my wrist but i had to stop because it would give me a headache everytime i took it. So i can't really say there were any benefits to it, because eventough it helped with the wrist pain, the headaches were worse.	see above	This was prescribed by a physical therapist. I was also receiving the physical therapy for my wrist pain, which was from work related injury.(repetitive overuse). The pain killer was to help with the pain from just moving my hands.
1747	topamax	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression/binge eating	With the Topamax alone, and not myself consciously changing any of my dietary habits or exercising, I lost about 10% of my body weight in the first two months of treatment. It was like a tiny switch in my brain was flipped and I just didn't crave gargantuan massive quantities of horrible-for-you food. Not that food didn't taste good, or I wasn't hungry, I just filled up really quickly, and nothing seemed any more appealing than anything else. So when you're not just going off whatever looks yummy at that exact second and you actually stop and think about what you're about to eat, you tend to choose something a tad bit healthier and less caloric. Combine that with the fact that it would take about half the amount to fill me up, and there you have your weight loss.	Dry mouth (I was also taking Prozac at the time which definitely contributed), mild transient tingling in the hands and feet (pins and needles), I've read a lot of posts in forums online from people suffering memory problems with Topamax (i.e. dopamax), they forget words easily, have trouble spelling, feel foggy, etc... I guess I'm one of the few fortunate people whom Topamax doesn't effect that way. Either that, or the dose I'm at (200 mg) is well below my tolerance threshold. Many of the people in these forums were being treated for epilepsy and debilitating migraines and taking doses up to 1200mg.	I had done some research on Topamax online before it was even an approved treatment for migraines, and it was only FDA approved for epilepsy. While on the web I found that a surprising amount of doctors were prescribing it for off-label purposes, such as an add-on to an SSRI that wasn't working well enough in depressed patients, a mood stabilizer in patients with bipolar disorder, and (gasp!) a weight loss drug in obese patients and in those with binge eating disorder. Several convincing clinical studies have been done in all of the above categories as well. Topamax will have clearance from the FDA to be marketed for the treatment of bipolar disorder in 2010.
1122	evista	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high blood levels of thrombisin	normal thrombosin level within 6 weeks	none	1 pill every morning
182	adderall	4	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	adha	This medication helped me marginally to focus better and was somewhat more energetic.	I did not had much side effects, had some dry mouth at times but was manageable.	I started with low dose with 5 mg dialy, gradually increased upto 20 mg. Did not hv satisfactory results but my psychiatrist did not feel comfortable to increase the dose due to serious drug abuse potential though I absolutely hv never tried as illicit drugs including the most commonly used MJ and alcohol.
418	imitrex	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine	no headaches and better quality of life  great at treating headaches	nervous system overhaul, dry mouth, stiff neck	used as needed  no healing- just treatment  the medicine was very effective at treating headaches as needed but provided no preventative help  still had them just as frequently but was able to rid myself of them
3790	keflex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	tonsillitis, sinusitis also bad tooth ache.	My pain in my head was gone after 5 days of taking this medicine. I feel so much better right now. I would recommend this medicine other than Amoxicillin, or any other antibiotic.	I had no side effects. I feel so much better. But I will say that I still am getting sinus headaches. I dont think those will ever go away though.	4 pills per day, keflex. to treat sinusitis, tonsillitis, and my bad tooth ache. It got rid of all my infection..totally...
3704	ranitidine	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	heartburn	heartburn was usually decreased significately if not totally	none	"I get heartburn caused more from my condition than from food. There were times that I had ""breakthrough"" heartburn even after using prevacid. I generally don't even use the prevacid now. I do try to not eat things that will cause heartburn but I still get heartburn often. I take the ranitidine often, but not every time I have heartburn. There are some times when I will take one or two Tums to get a jumpstart against the burning."
574	lithium-carbonate	5	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bipolar disorder	I felt a bit calmer and had a little less mania, but it did not help much.	upset stomach, low appetite, metallic taste, tremor	"I was given lithium in order to calm my manic thoughts and depressive symptoms along with psychotherapy. I did not notice much improvement from lithium.
It did come with unwanted side effects such as persistent tremor and
upset stomach. I would like to try another medication."
229	wellbutrin-xl	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	dysthymia ( chronic, low grade depression )	It lifted my depression without any noticeable side effects which I had experienced with every other anti-depressant I had taken.	None.	"I had been prescribed 300 mg which is a normal dosage, but fond it made me sleepless.  So after talking with my doctor, we agreed to let me try half the dosage.  I'm especially sensitive to medications and always feel overdosed at the 'standard' dosage. 
I've been taking Wellbutrin for the last 8 years and only recenyly felt the need to boost it up to 300 mg as the depression seemed to be inching up. It worked for me and I will maintain the 300 mg through the winter months. 
I think this is a wonderful drug, if nothing else works for you, give it a try."
1249	catapres	2	Ineffective	Mild Side Effects	hot flashes	It was supposed to stop the hot flashes that were keeping me awake at night.	Left me extremely sleepy the next day to the point I had to lay down an hour after I got up and I noticed no real difference in the hot flashes.	I wanted to stop hot flashes without going on HRT medication.  My doctor recommended trying Clonidine
4022	celexa	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety attacks when driving	i had become unable to drive any further than 1/2 mile to my job and no further without suffering serious anxiety attacks.  after a little over a week on the medication, i was able to drive in heavy traffic, and basically anywhere i needed to go.  my life has become my own again	none	i only had to start taking 1 tablet a day, and after a little over a week, i could definitely tell a difference.
536	trazodone	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	sleeplessness associated with depression	It helped me sleep, which at the time was miraculous.	Bad taste in mouth but the sleep was worth it.	If I could tell I was going to have a hard time sleeping, I was supposed to take the medecine about 45 minutes before going to bed.  Sometimes it was hard to realize/remember to take it ahead of time like that, but it was so fast-acting that wasn't really a problem.  I'm little, 5'2 and 120 lbs, and the doctor said it was okay to break them in half so I mostly did.  After about fifteen minutes I would get drowsy and then I would get a nice night's sleep.   This was incredibly valuable and it was no problem to go off the medication at the end of treatment because I was only taking it when I needed it anyway, only a couple times a week at the worst point.  The halitosis might have actually made it easier to stop taking--I had to really want the sleep and be willing to put up with the foul taste in my mouth. But if I needed the sleep badly enough it was really worth it.
3177	desyrel	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	sleeplessness	effective for falling and staying asleep	slight dry mouth initially, but this subsided with use (3 - 4 weeks)	My problem was never falling asleep, it was waking up a few hours after falling asleep and being wide awake, my mind racing on thoughts of the day.  This medicine allowed me to fall asleep quickly and stay sleeping throughout the night.  My doctor told me it was originally marketed for anxiety/depression, but not widely prescribed for that once the sedative effects became known.  (I can't imagine taking one of these in the morning, as a anti-depressant....It would surely knock me out.)  The tablets are sold as 150 mg tablets.  I split mine (75 mg) and for $4 at Target, I get two months worth.  Highly recommend this for those who can't fall or stay asleep.
3711	lamictal	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bipolar	Lamictal balanced moods without making me sluggish or slowing me down. I still have the highs and but they aren't drastically manically high.	Although it says it doesn't affect weight I did experience weight gain. It also makes me a little drowsy.	I take 200 mg lamictal once per day at night so that I am not affected by the drowsiness. Initially I started at 25mg and it was increased over time until I reached 200 mg in order to avoid side effects. It took time to experience the benefits. About 6 weeks.
2871	avita	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	The benefits of using Tretinoin were great. First of all I noticed that my skin started glowing and my acne diminished greatly. But I had to be very patient because the results were not immediate. Continued use of the medicine rendered amazing results. My skin is a lot more smoother, healthier, and brighter.	luckily I did not notice any negative side effects. The positive effects that I noticed out weighed the negative ones. The side effects that i noticed were very slight peeling of the skin and a very very slight burning sensation. The burning sensation however, completely went away with continued use of the medicine. I believe this is so because my skin became more and more tolerant the more I used it.	My treatment details are as follows: I Used Avita (Tretinoin) every night after cleansing my face. I waited about 15-20 minutes after cleansing to apply a dime size of the medication. My doctor recommended doing so to make the skin less sensitive and more receptive of the drug. My doctor also told me that the use of sunscreen was imperative while using Tretinoin because retinol can cause the skin to become sensitive to sunlight. So every morning before leaving the house I made sure to apply a sunscreen.
1824	yasmin	5	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	birth control	Birth control, more mild and regular menstruation	Fatigue (severe during the first week of the month), nausea, mild depression	Appointment with doctor once every six months to monitor overall health, took pill once daily (usually in the morning after breakfast).
1134	methadone	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	addiction	The benefits was getting off of drugs.  I go to a methadone clinic and i PAY $13 a day and i have for the last seven years.  It helped me get off of Oxycotin's, but i would NOT recommend staying on it for long..  Because methadone is more addictive than pain pills.	"passing out; falling asleep
drowsiness,
weight gain
when i first started i had alot of nausea, but after a few months it was better."	"When i first started going to the methadone clinic, i had to go there withdrawing.  I had to take a physical and a drug test when i started.  You can fail the first test, because they know you would have drugs in your system.  I had to pay $154 when i first started and i pay almost $400 a month, which equals out to be $13.50 a day.

I get drug tested every month and i have passed so many that i get ""take homes"".  I only have to go there once a month now and i have to see my counslor for an hour each month and get drug tested.  I get called in for random drug testing.  I have to bring my bottles in so they will know that they are ""straight"" so they know i am not selling them.  They do that to everyone.  

I have been there for seven years now and i am 26 years old.  WHen i first started, i had to drive 1 1/2 hours a day for seven days a week for three months and then i got one take home.

after three months of passing drug tests:  1 take home
6 months:  3 take homes
one year:  5 take homes
1 1/2 years: a weeks worth
2 years: 2 weeks worth
2 1/2 years:  a months worth....  I had to drive so much where there isn't many clinics in the states and i had to drive that far just to get to mine.

I have been doing good and being strong.  I just wish i would have lowered myself down after about 6 months.  So now i am addicted to methadone.  It is just legal and cheaper for me then pills and i know i get it everyday.

I hope i helped.

Thanks.  :)"
276	xyrem	3	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	sleep disorders	I ahve three sleep disorders: sleep apnea due to closing up of my throat (anatomical), restless leg syndrome and the worst one, hypersomnia -- tired much of the time with no explanation. I tried this drug - sent directly to the home and only with approved diagnosis (I am just short of narcolepsy) - to see if I would feel rested when I awoke. I did for one day but then the effects did not continue with each successive night. Sounds strange, I know, but that is what happened.	I did not have any side effects except that if I got less than 4 1/2 hours of sleep after waking to take the second dose - I would stillfeel the effects -- as if drugged a bit.	I think I have included everything above. I tried a second week and felt a slight refreshed feeling upon awakening - but not significant ewnough to keep taking it. Understand, I only remember awakening refreshed 3 times in my life. one of them after that first night I used Xyrem. I have enough to try a third week and probably will -- since I am desperate for my former qualilty of life when I didn't struggle with feeling tired as I do now.
1739	topamax	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraines	Migraines diminished and appetite diminished, resulting in lost weight.	Initially began with 25 mg and increased in 25 mg increments until reaching 175 mg daily. Difficulty in concentration, moodiness became the norm, stress. Loss of weight which most likely caused the diagnosed potassium deficiency, which resulted in an irregular heat beat, resulting in stress symptoms, which resulted in stress test. Very difficult first six months.	"Switched doctors, my decision to stop medication. Migraines returned. Began taking Topamax again, under different doctor, but at a dose of 50 mg daily.  Worked. Migraines greatly reduced, a slight difficulty initially with concentration and moodiness but then those symptoms improved. 

A year later at 50 mg daily I'm doing well. I can safely increase up to 75 mg when I know that known triggers are expected - low pressure weather system, menstrual cycle (haven't conquered that migraine yet!) etc."
242	wellbutrin-xl	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Wellbutrin XL was the only anti-depressant I tried that I could take without noticable side effects. A big contributer to my depression was weight gain that accompanied it, and as a result my doctor prescribed wellbutrin because typically the patient either stays the same or loses weight will taking it, as opposed to almost every other anti-depressent which can cause weight gain.	Very minimal side effects. Only noticable thing is that you can feel the pill wear off near bed time and that can cause a sudden spike in appetite.	The wellbutrin helped me regain control of my appetite and as a result i took back control of my happiness and wellbeing.

1294	zocor	5	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high blood cholesterol	The drug did lower the blood cholesterol effectively.	"The side effects included nightmares, muscle weakness, dizziness. 
In addition there were emotional disturbances."	The drug was prescribed by a Cardiologist and was effective, however the side effects were considerable. After approximately one year the cholesterol LDL did drop and although this was positive, the side effects continued. After two years, the dosage was reduced to alternative days at the same daily dose. If the cholesterol level remains normal, with the adjustment of diet and exercise, the plan is to further reduce the drug over time.
3199	omnicef	1	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	strep throat	Cleared upper respitory infection and strep throat	Yeast infection, hives, and overall skin sensitivity from clothing and certain foods, still unknown, trigger hives...simple things like wine, goldfish, lactaid milk, pancakes, eggs, bread, nuts, strawberries.	"The antibiotic significantly diminishes the immune system, allowing severe sensitivity to take over body and consumes productivity of your overall life. 

After four months, I still flare up from simple triggers and makes life pretty much stagnant."
1079	effexor	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	ALSO HELPED WITH HOT FLASHES. IT ALLOWED FOR ME TO CARRY ON WITH NORMAL ACTIVITIES.	MILD JITTERS WHEN FIRST TAKING. IF SKIPPED WOULD CAUSE EXTREME HEAVINESS AND TIREDNESS	i TOOK EFEXXOR IN THE AM AND AT LUNCH
3942	prilosec	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	gerd	Acid reflux ceased to exist when taking Prilosec.	I have had no side effects from Prilosec.	It's pill you take 20 minutes before eating breakfast.  It stops the acid from the stomach backing up into the esopogus.
2499	remeron	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	greater depression	Depression has cleared up quite miraculously.	Eating too much - no sense of when to stop. Slight antihistamine feel.	"I had been on Celexa for two years, and noticed a major change in my libidio and concurrent diminishment of feeling in my sexual parts.  As I am married I started taking Cialis to maintain an erection, and it worked fine, however, Cialis didn't make me feel any more during lovemaking, and the whole topic increased my depression and worry. I didn't wish my wife to find out I took Cialis because I love her dearly and didn't want her to think my sexual feelings were drug induced.  

I searched the internet for non-SSRI antidepressants with little or no sexual side effects.  I talked to my psychiatrist about Mirtazapine and he was fine with taperinf me off of the Citalopram. Within days of decreasing the Citalopram I felt so much smarter. The Mirtazapine has really allayed the depression and most of my anxiety.  I do also take Buproprion and the two things do seem to allay depression and anxiety.

I definitely recommend trying Mirtazapine if you're depressed, especially if you either hate SSRIs, or haven't founnd anything else which works. It doesn't really have such bad side effects. And my dreaming has become really interesting. I actually can't wait to go to bed now.  I did have a nightmare the first night I took it, but not since then. Instead I have had all sorts of dream desire fulfillment, and it's odd how much that can make you feel more resourceful for the rest of your day.

I also wasn't able to work for the last two years because of moodiness and benzodiazpine use for anxiety and sleep.  Now I have cut out all thosoe medications and I really do feel much better.  Eating too much does seem to be an issue. I eat so much sometimes that I can't breate. That part is going to demand some serious self - control."
4012	celexa	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	It helped greatly with depression but had immediate sexual side effects.	Sexual side effects - loss of desire  also increased my restless leg syndrome.	I was on the medication for about three months.  It helped enormously with the depression - i react well to SSRI's - but as is typical for those meds, the side effects were too much for me and i switched to wellbutrin
2649	aldara	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	bowens cancer on tip of nose	cancer is gone	flu like feelings, very tired, blurred vision,then started getting really dry skin all over my face, then started getting burns all down both arms. The dermatologist did a biopsy and the results weere I have Subacute Lupis Erythematosus whish is directly related to taking this drug aldaa. My lymph nodes were swollen. It was horrible and now I am left with this lifetime crap to deal with, can't go in the sun breakout of burns are always a threat. Am sooo sorry I ever took this drug.	I had to take this drug for 5 days and then come off of it for 2 days
3461	ambien-cr	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	sleeplessness	This drug has done wonders to help me get the much needed rest I have needed.

It works quickly, within half an hour and I have been able to stay asleep throughout the night.	None	This drug is taken shortly before bedtime, as needed.
2864	aldactone	1	Highly Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	acne	Takes about 3 months to show results, but cleared up my skin, reduced overall oiliness and enlarged pores, and eliminated my very greasy hair, caused by excess oil on my scalp. My skin looked hydrated, clarity was good and the improvement was constant with no variations after the first 3 months. Also contributed a significant improvement to my libido.	Periods about every 14 days. After 12 months of use, DCIS detected in my right breast. No history of breast cancer in the family at all, and I was in good health otherwise. Malignant tumour of the breast was one of the side effects I located on the internet.	I am happy to complete this but dont know what you mean, I have already given the dosage. Can you email me what it is you want here?
3191	tylenol-with-codeine	1	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	pain after minor surgery	Due to extensive varicose veins, I was in pain, especially when standing. They were physically embarassing and I could not even wear sheer pantyhose. The surgery would eliminate pain and the ugliness.   I was told to take the drug before surgery to minimize swelling and to minimize pain. I do not like to introduce drugs into my body unless an emergency so I did not take it before the surgery, instead opting for Bromelain enzyme, ginger and tumeric to reduce swelling.	The side effects after the surgery were swelling and pain and possibly infection at the incision sites. About 10 hours post surgery, the pain became unbearable, and I decided to take one dose of acetaminophen w/codeine #3.  When I got up a couple of hours later to go and use the bathroom, I passed out in the bathroom. Lucky for me, my husband was nearby.	I had a large vein stripped from my thigh and smaller ones in the leg, due to pain and discomfort I had been experiencing. It was an outpatient procedure that lasted about 2 hours.
3860	levoxyl	4	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	lethergy	I got up and felt better in the morning, then as the day went on I felt more and more lethargic so I dont know if I was taking the right amount or if it was the drug. I then took it twice a day but it did not seem to help my lethargy	bone aches	1 daily
1520	glucophage	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	insulin resistance	I experienced weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, increased energy and decreased carbohydrate cravings during the course of the day.	I did not experience any side effects from taking this medication.  I did have an occasional problem with some abdominal pain but it was not significant and went away on its own.	I took 1 (one) 750 mg pill once a day taken in the morning.
1662	climara	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	hormone replacement therapy	no positive benefits	mood changes, weight gain (4 pounds in 3 days!) extremely emotional. depression	"I had been using the trade brand of this patch, Climara for several months with positive results.  One month my local pharmacy was out of the trade brand and offered to fill the prescription with the generic brand and because I was in a hurry to catch a plane to go on a vacation, I agreed, thinking they had to be similar.  Wrong!  To begin with, the generic patch is twice the size and thickness of the trade brand - don't even think of wearing tight clothes while sporting one of these!  (I laughlingly told my husband we could always use one to patch a flat tire if needed, but soon it wasn't so funny.)  Within a day or two I knew something was wrong, but hadn't yet identified the problem.  I couldn't stop crying about nothing in particular.  It seemed as if overnight, my world had become very sad and depressing. I immediately began to gain weight, despite no change in my dietary habits.  After finally putting two and two together, I ripped it off and contacted my local pharmacist to see if anyone else had complained of similar experiences.  After rechecking my prescription, the pharmacist noticed my physician had marked ""no generics"".  Apparently, he had a good reason for this choice as this was not his usual stance on generics.  The pharmacist refilled my prescription with the trade brand and all was quickly back to normal. I usually have no problem with genereic brands, but unfortunately, no more generic estradiol for me!"
1292	zocor	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	cholesterol	Taken only four days... not tested for benefits	Extreme pain in calf that soon extended to entire leg. Muscles were rigid. I still suffer leg pain after more than a year off the four doses of Zocor. Just visited Disneyword and did not realize till then how badly my legs hurt - day and night.	One 20mg tab for four days upon advice of physician
346	neurontin	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	nerve pain - great skin sensitivity	The benefits are that being on Neurontin with the Lidoderm Patch 5%, it has helped to give me a much better quality of life.  My pain is significantly reduced because of these two medications, though not completely gone.  The side effects, to my knowledge, have been minimal, especially compared to what it could be without these medications.  Could a different medication work better?  Maybe.	It's hard to say what the side effects might be.  I sometimes have trouble thinking or speaking my thoughts concisely, moodiness, somewhat depressed, shortness of breath at times, dizziness, occasional vision problems, some numbness or odd sensations in legs or arms etc.  However, I can't say for sure if any of these side effects/symptoms are from taking Neurontin, the lidoderm patch or for some other reason (stresses...).	Ten years ago I had spinal chord surgery to remove a tumor.  Fortunately it was benign.  The down side is that it pressed on the nerves so much that it permanently damaged them.  The greatest nerve pain I have is from the center of my chest all the way around on the right side (breast area) to the center of my back on the right.  The skin in that area is so sensitive that any clothing even slightly rubbing on it can cause great pain.  I have been very happy with Neurotin for the most part.  I know it is working because if I am late taking my next dose (every eight hours) the pain starts to increases.  The Neurotin alone does not work well.  In addition, I have to wear a Lidoderm patch.  This has made a huge difference.  Now, after nine years I'm beginning to feel my medication isn't working as well as it used to and am planning to review these changes with my doctor.
560	doryx	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	back acne	In saw immediate improvement in the clearing of my acne within the first week.	Yeast infection by day 7 despite eating yogurt and taking Acidophilus along with Doryx as suggested when I was prescribed the medication. The side effects definitely outweigh the benefits in this case.	I am following up with the derm tomorrow to see if there is an alternative treatment because I can not go through these side effects again.
1530	skelaxin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	muscle spasm	It relaxed the spasm's in my back and neck, if not completely, at least  by 50-70 percent.  The best thing about this drug is that you can take it at work or during the day, and it does not make you drowsey or loopy.	I experienced no side effects, other then the expected outcome, which was releif of the muscle spasam.	I take this drug only as needed, when my back or neck feels tight or in spasam.  It is perfect for the weekend warrior, or someone who has occassional muscle soreness and tightness.
4042	amoxil	3	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	post surgery	Avoidance of infection.	Full body hives appearing 8 days after treatment began.	Standard post surgery antibiotic.
480	tekturna-hct	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	high blood pressure	none,pressure never came down to acceptable range and had wide swings throughout the day	pounding headache, nausea,  dizziness while walking and arising from bed/chair, spots in eye, uncontrollable eye tearing. The latter two are still present after6 weeks on not taking meds.	they didn't work even after dossage was increased, Monitored at home and in doctor's office, results were the same.
257	ultram	8	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hand pain	Since I tried to avoid the GI effect of Motrin, or celebrex if used too long, the tramadol seemed a good alterntive.  I took it in the morning, and it generally seemed to energize me enough so that I stayed active, and if it didn't relieve the pain, It seemed to keep me from thinking about it and I remained busy.	I did find that if I took it in the late afternoon, I really   couldn't sleep at night, mymind raed and I felt unsettled.   It reduced my appetite a bit, ad I would work without eating, or drinking.  Had to remind myself to eat.	I have degenerative joint desease in both my hands.  Took the standrd painkillers, not narcotics, but asa, tylenol, motrin, and then Celebrex.  The best was celebrex, but there is a danger with taking it long term.  Ultram ws prescribed at first as 50mg twice a day.  This wasn't at all effective.  So we upped the dose, and this worked well, except not at night. Since then I hae had boththumb joints replaced, and althoughI still have a prescription for the Ultram, I rarely use it... sometimes for back aches.  Someone once told me it is an opiate derivative.  If so, it does not seem to have an addictive quality, or any withdrawal symptoms, at least not the way I have used it.
1266	provigil	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	daytime sleepiness	Virtually nil. PLEASE< PLEASE read on....	"If you take a look at the side effects the FDA requires Provigil manufacturer Cephalon to list, you will find the usual stomach aches, headaches etc.. Such side effects are so common that virtually every new prescription medication ends up listing them, which is why most of us don't bother reading the side effect profile for meds. However, failing to look at the side effects for Provigil could end up costing you your life. Provigil of course does list the usual side effects, yes, but ther is one side effect listed that is rarely included as a medication side effect.  Further, even if you should happen to actually read the list of Provigil's side you are not likely to know what it means. The side effect is called ""vasodilatation"", and the manufacturer reported to the FDA that it occurred to 1 out of every 50 test subjects while it happened to 0 out of every 50 who took the placebo. What is ""vasodilatation""?  Vasodilatation, nearly always referred to as the more recognizable ""vasodilation"", refers to the general relaxation of blood vessels, a phenomenon that usually ends up causing a small drop in blood pressure but sometimes causes a significant blood pressure drop, when it is then called hypotension.  And, if you'll read on, you'll see why for me, and potentially for 1 out of every 50 users of Provigil, it very nearly killed me.  

After 7 weeks on Provigil, with the last week having been increased from 200mg to 300mg per day, I awoke one morning in a highly delusional state, speaking of non-existent farm animals wandering around the kitchen table where my wife and I were seated. After apparently collapsing in my bedroom, I was taken to ER, which quickly determined that I was critically hypotensive (low blood pressure of 72/35). I quickly lapsed into cardiogenic shock, a condition where the heart all but stops pumping blood and one of the deadliest of all medical crises. Even among those who are still alive upon arrival at an ER,  70% to 80% die within hours or a few days. Those who survive likely do so, as I did, with kidneys in acute failure and brain damage similar to what is sustained by near-drowning victims who have been resuscitated by a lengthy CPR session."	"My ER doctor immediately paged the cardiologist on call. Arriving quickly, he assessed my condition and determined that my only chance of survival was a transport to a regional heart center 35 miles away. As he awaited the ambulance, he took me to my local hospital's heart catheterization lab, not to put a stent in, but to push a tiny balloon through  my femoral artery to a destination next to my aorta, after which a tiny battery powered air pump was used to inflate the balloon and keep it inflated. The balloon (called an intra-aortic balloon pump) works by temporarily filling the empty space around the heart, then applying continuous gentle pressure to my aorta in an effort to keep my blood pressure from additional falling past the small amount that would otherwise kill me. Arriving at the heart center I was unconscious and would lapse into a coma for 9 days, kept alive by mechanical ventilation through a tube inserted through my throat to my lungs (""I'm in"", the TV doctors always say when the get the insertion right)."
535	trazodone	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	Helps me to sleep although does NOT help RLS.  I sleep through the night now with requip to still my legs and trazodone to help me sleep.  It has made a HUGE difference.  I went through a sleep study prior to taking these meds and it turned out I was not getting any sustained deep sleep.	At first I was terrible groggy, but I adjusted.	I take it every night about 1/2 hour before I go to bed.  If i wait too late, i am tired in the morning but it is worth it!
124	valtrex	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	herpes	It drastically reduced breakouts all over my body therefore I did not constantly have flu like symptoms because of the breakouts. So even under stressful life events which usually results with a breakout the Valtrax stopped or reduced the frequency of breakouts. So far I have only been taking 1 per day and I have not had any breakouts for a month.	It initially made me feel tired and lethargic. I believe it contributed to  a short bout of stomach upset and heavy bowel movements however this problem subsided fairly quickly. I think it also contributes to my eyes feeling dryer than usual. Since I am post menopausal dry eyes is a huge problem.	I was supposed to take 2 tablets a day 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening. I followed this regimen for 1 and a half weeks then I decided to reduce the dosage myself to 1 per day. I checked with the ND and she said that protocol could be followed unless I felt that I was going to have a breakout then go back to 2 a day. I can take up to 4 per day if needed however so far the 1 per day has worked well for me.
3190	desyrel	2	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety,insomnia	The first five days I felt amazing and I have had great sleeps for the 16 days.	After the 5th day, I still slept well but my anxiety returned.  My balance has been off, I am extremely tired all day, there is a bad taste in my mouth which alters the taste of food. My mouth is so dry that I drink non-stop and cough a lot. What made me decide to quit this drug before the month trial is the fact that I have this really bad memory loss.  I forget where I live, my dog's name, my employees' names.  I would look at a steak and not remember what it was called.  I would stare blankly.  My job is detail oriented and I could not concentrate.	I am supposed to take 50 mg a day.  I was told to take 1/2 in morning and 1/2 at bedtime or 50 mg at bedtime or 50 mg in the morning.  Whatever works.  There are so many side effects that the good night sleep will have to be given up.  I can't stand a drug taking control of my body.  I hope there is a better treatment.  I have a call into my doctor.
3859	levoxyl	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	Less fatigue, less weight unaccountable weight gain, less hair fall-out.	None	The only difficulty taking this is that one has to wait thirty minutes before eating or drinking in the morning.  Therefore I take it upon first waking up - immediately.  Or sometimes I take it and go back to bed if I am awake early.
2428	synthroid	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	low thyroid	The synthroid medication did, for most of the ten years while I took it, keep my thyroid levels where they were supposed to be.	After taking this synthroid medication for a period of about 10 years, here is what happened.  We were on vacation in another state and all of a sudden I began to feel extremely horrible-- very weak, with a rapid heart beat.  We were getting ready to get on an airplane and come home.  So I thought if I can just get to my home town and get to a hospital, they can surely figure out what is wrong with me.  We arrived at our home airport and then we went straight to the emergency room, where they ran several tests and I was there for several hours, but they could find nothing wrong with me.  So they told me to go to my regular doctor the next day, which I did of course and he ran a blood test and found that it was the thyroid medication that was causing my problems.	"I was able to find an osteopathic doctor who put me on a natural thyroid, not a synthetic, he calld it a dessicated thyroid which came from an animal source, so I was able to get off the synthetic.  Then after being on that for a while, he was able to get me off of that and I took a natural supplement, L- tyrosine 
It was wonderful to get off of a prescription medication.  I hope this information may be helpful to someone out there."
2039	cozaar	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	Within a few weeks of starting, my pressure was under control and has remained that way for over 5 years.	I had no side effects that I noticed.	I was diagnosed with high blood pressure (145/90) over 10 years ago, a few years after experiencing early menopause. Severe headaches were also commmon. First treatment: dietary changes and increasing daily exercise--not adequate; in fact, it increased. I was prescribed Cozaar, 50 mg/day, with the reminder that the first dosage tried was rarely the correct one. In my case, it was and I get checked now every 6 months. My blood pressure stays around 118/70 range.
2872	avita	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	The benefits of using Tretinoin were great. First of all I noticed that my skin started glowing and my acne diminished greatly. But I had to be very patient because the results were not immediate. Continued use of the medicine rendered amazing results. My skin is a lot more smoother, healthier, and brighter.	luckily I did not notice any negative side effects. The positive effects that I noticed out weighed the negative ones. The side effects that i noticed were very slight peeling of the skin and a very very slight burning sensation. The burning sensation however, completely went away with continued use of the medicine. I believe this is so because my skin became more and more tolerant the more I used it.	My treatment details are as follows: I Used Avita (Tretinoin) every night after cleansing my face. I waited about 15-20 minutes after cleansing to apply a dime size of the medication. My doctor recommended doing so to make the skin less sensitive and more receptive of the drug. My doctor also told me that the use of sunscreen was imperative while using Tretinoin because retinol can cause the skin to become sensitive to sunlight. So every morning before leaving the house I made sure to apply a sunscreen.
2982	strattera	3	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	add	My ability to focus improved and I was overall calmer.	Severe depression and thoughts of death.	I found myself staring at the wall more than anything else. I felt totally drugged. My personality changed from somewhat lively to something very dull. It was as if the medication numbed my senses. I discontinued Strattera after one month. I couldn't tolerate the depression anymore.
865	valium	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	migraines, back spasm, insomnia	I have found Valium to be a godsend. It helps stave off migraine attacks, it helps me get to sleep when I have insomnia, and it relaxes  the muscles in my back when I get spasms. I use it sparingly, only when I really need it, (about 2-3 times a week ) and I have not found it to be addictive at all. I actually find it to be relatively mild, and I think it's over-regulated.	I don't have any side effects from taking it.	"My migraine attacks are directly related to muscle spasms that occur in my lower intestine. My doctor called it an ""abdominal migraine."" If I take a Valium when I feel a migraine coming on, it often goes away without having to take a Maxalt. I've had a mastectomy, chemo & radiation, and have been through a lot of anxiety, but I don't rely on Valium as an anti-anxiety drug. I'd be eating them like candy if I did, and then I probably would get addicted. I think Valium should be considered more of a muscle relaxant. That's how I use it, anyway."
1928	zithromax	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	pneumonia	It cleared up my coughing within 2 days.  I could sleep far better at night.	I had mild diarrhea, though I'm not sure if it was due to the drug.	I was told by my doctor to take the medication once a day for about 5 days.  The best results came within 2 days, and seemed to plateau after that.  I requested another prescription so I ended up taking it for about 2 weeks, but I seemed to see little improvement during the 2nd prescription.  It was probably because the bacteria was kept under control, but my body was taking time to heal.
688	accutane	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	acne	REDUCED AMOUNT OF CYSTIC ACNE	BALDNESS, SENSITIVITY TO SUNLIGHT, NIGHT VISION BLURRINESS	TAKE 1 PILL A DAY, BLOOD TOXICITY TESTS EVERY TWO WEEKS
1617	premarin	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	menopause	there were no treatment benifits that I could desern because I quit taking the drug because of the severe side effects	I had extreme weight gain, fluctuating emotions.  I felt I was going insane so I stopped taking the drug.	I was starting menopause and was having hot flashes and disturbed sleep, and migrane headaches.  the doctor prescribed premerin and I only took it for 2 months.  I saw a natural medicine doctor and started on a natural hormone therapy that worked very well.  My headaches stopped and My sleep pattern returned to normal and I lost the weight I gained while on the premerin.
1510	metoprolol	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hypertension	My blood pressure readings have improved.	There were no side effects. I have tolerated the drug very well.	I have taken this drug daily for three years for hypertension in combination with Lotrel. My blood pressure readings have dropped from 160/120 to 120/80. The drug has been effective and well-tolerated.
1917	avelox	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	sinus infection	No benefit at all	I'm kinda glad to see I wasn't the only one who experienced this.  I honestly felt I was going to end up in the hospital.  Sweats, heavy nausea, dizziness, my whole body felt numb and shaking, extreme cramping.  The next day, I felt I didn't have any muscles!!  Weak and felt drunk! Aweful experience!	I took only one. Never again!
3605	retin-a	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	I had some experience with Retin-A when I was a teenager in the mid 90's.  My mom and I have the same type of skin - we both have some degree of acne as adults.  In the 90's my Mom started using Retin-A to control this and apparently it worked well, so I tried it (her prescription) as a teenager and it just irritated my face , making it red and eventually flaky.  The drug is certainly powerful.  I am sure I would have benefited from continued use but I didn't.  Now, approaching 30, I still have some acne and am starting to think any acne whatsoever is unacceptable.  Reviewing options, Retin-A seems top on the list.  I have read that retinol is a distant second.  However, I am hesitant because of the inevitable initial irritation and flakyness associated with Retin-A.	see above	see above
1334	prevacid	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	servere stomach pains and reaccuring gastritis.	"stomach pains lesson over time it would take around 4/5 days to start working.
was told by the doctor not to use the medication for years but for one to two months at a time."	"starting up effects dizziness,nausea, but would subside when medication started getting into my system.
Would also feel tired while taking it and would sometimes make you feel unwell but I only found this on the 30mg."	After stopping though stomach pain returns within 3 weeks.
2762	risperdal-consta	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bipolar	depression lessened	headaches after 4 years, no control over breathing, the drug created inner emotions and feeling that weren't present before starting taking the medication, the bi-treatment of lithium and risperidone also created feeling of excessive sleepiness, created a weight gain of more than my normal size, colors of objects turn more bland and life seems more pointless when taking risperidone during the day. Taking the medication at bedtime turned out to be better. Smoke 2 packs a day after taking the medication at night and waking up the next day. Less able to control emotions.	I had more energy than others when i was younger and the doctors and parents wanted to punish me for it by putting me on medication. Havn't been able to get off them since because they are addicting and mind warping.
490	meridia	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	obesity	Lost 30 lbs in first month of treatment. Portion size was easy to control. If busy I sometimes forgot to eat. Mood was slightly altered for the first week - I was more patient - but this was short term. This medication has changed my relationship with food and I feel in control.	Felt a little spacey and calm for first few days. Sleep was disrupted for about two weeks - waking hourly. Excess energy and restlessness for the first week.	10mg for 1st month, 15mg for next month.
2493	remeron	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	Boosted my mood a fair amount. My MD chose this med because I was having significant insomnia, and it definitely helped that, which was great.	But after I had caught up on my sleep, I felt very grogged out, even in the daytime. This was not acceptable, and I soon stopped the med.	Took before med to help with sleep and avoid daytime grogginess. But it still made me groggy during the day.
2728	elavil	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	"I have had severe migraines for over 20 years. Since taking the amitriptyline my migraines have decreased to once or twice every six months! As long as I take the ""elavil"" and watch for triggers I am now in control of my migraines and not the other way around."	groggy in the morning, slight weight gain, dry mouth	I started at 25 mg and that increased to 50 mg.
3155	prednisone	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	asthma	The treatment benefits of taking predisone for asthama were that it reduced the inflammation and eased breathing.  Although steroids are being scrutinized in the media at this time, they do have a place in the treatment of life threatening episodes of asthma and other diseases that casue severe inflammation.  I do not care to be on prednisone for any period of time, however, breathing is necessary to life and the prednisone offers a quick relief of the symptoms.	While taking the prednisone I had an increase in blood pressure.  I also was very perspired while the dose was higher and felt extremely edgy and agitated.	The prednisone was prescribed for a rebound effect after an anaphylactic reaction.  While at the ER I was given solumedrol and benadryl.  Since I have asthma, a prednisone taper was prescribed in the event that a rebound effect occured, which it did.  I began the taper immediately upon the worsening of symptoms.  It took about 3 hours for the prednisone to begin working.  During that time, there was a back and forth response from my body as it fought the prednisone for control.  During this event, I learned that I will always use my Epipen in the future as adrenalin is not always part of the protocol at the ER.  The adrenalin stops the initial reaction and may prevent the need for the prednisone later.
3490	dyrenium	10	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hypertension	Normal blood pressure	Depletion of potassium, and heat and cold sensitivity (inability for body to regulate temp)	I was diagnosed with mild hypertension at age 24.

1440	tirosint	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidsim	Patient had tried Synthroid, and one other with Iodine which I cannot remember name of(came from pigs). I however did not ever feel any different or better from taking. Was looking to increse energy levels so tried Levothyroxine.	"Synthroid OK, no side effects, the other one(made from pig hormone), my OBGYN advised not to take, said was ""gross"" and recommended Levothyroxine; been on ever since."	Treatment is once a day, by mouth in the morning before ingesting any food.
1202	prozac	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	depression	I felt less anxiety and fewer down moods.	none.  I had hoped to have the side effect of weight loss but didn't.  I didn't notice a reduction in libido as my husband did when he took Paxil.	I was depressed and had a lot of nightmares and prozac reduced both of these problems.  I have been taking the same dosage for nearly 20 years now.
92	pristiq	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	severe depression	I had no benefits	Nausea, dizziness, increased anxiety, and extreme irritibility.	I could not control my irritability.  It was out of control.  I felt like I was not myself.  When starting my third week on this med, I stopped.  By day two I felt much better.  Would not try this drug again.  Had only slight nausea after stopping this medications that quickly went away.  My depression worsened on this med.  Would not recommend.
2207	advair-diskus	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	asthma	Ever since I was littel I would use albuterol at night about once a week when needed because my breathing was so bad.  Ever since I've been on advair, I no longer need albuterol.  My breathing is stronger according to doctors and I enjoy exercise without having breathing complications.	There are no negative side effects that I know of.	In the morning I crush a pill and breath it in through the mouth peice.  This is done at night as well.  I continue to do this everyday day for about 5 years now.
731	claripel-cream	4	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	reaction with benzoyl peroxide	The product did lighten the skin, which was the desired results. The was some redness and skin warming, but those side effects were tolerable.	I had an allergic reaction when used with benzoyl peroxide. My pores became enlarged, and were plugged with blackheads. My research found that when used with benzoyl peroxide, staining and pore enlargement might be a side effect, which I did suffer.	I was prescribed hydroquinone to lighten/even my skin tone prior to laser treatment of scarring due to acne. About two days in to the treatment, I noticed the pore enlargement and staining. After 10 days, I discontinued the treatment due to the side effects.
1829	yasmin	7	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	birth control	Effective birth control	Moodiness and weight loss	Hi - I switched from Ortho Tri Cyclen to Yasim because the country I moved to did not have Ortho Tri Cyclen.  It was fine but I feel like it made me moody.  Although the pluses were slight weight loss.  When I moved back to the US I went back to Ortho Tri Cyclen because I did not like the moodiness.  Both drugs have done wonders for my skin.

"because my Lyme disease is chronic (but that doesn't mean incurable!), I have to continue antibiotic treatments whenever symptoms flare.  the goal is to suppress symptoms, eventually, with my own strong immune system.  by the way, the IDSA's recommendations for Lyme disease treatment are just plain wrong. So if you're reading this database looking for Lyme disease treatment ideas, ignore any advice that ""Lyme disease is uncommon, easily detected, and easily cured,"" and ignore the IDSA guidelines.  Those idiots."

There is not much more to say, i am just filling the ""50 words"", so go on reading."	Very high blood pressure	Since taking Zyrtec, my bloodpressure rose very high. First i did not recognize this was because of the Zyrtec, but discontinuing the drug brought back normal blood pressure.
839	ritalin	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	fibromyalgia	I now have more energy, better focus, better weight control, less hypglycemia, feel more upbeat, less prone to depression.  I can work more efficiently now, can get through my day without feeling like I need to lie down on the floor and sleep!	I notice that if I drink caffeinated beverages I get way too jittery, whereas I used to use coffee and diet caffeinated drinks to keep my energy level up and they wouldn't bother me by making me too hyper.  So I have to stay away from those.  Also, if I take a dose too late in the day, I stay up too late!	I have fibromyalgia, and was having a hard time with the high fatigue levels and difficulty concentrating.  At first I just took Wellbutrin to help with these things, but a doctor suggested trying Ritalin for better results.  It does work much better than the Wellbutrin for these symptoms.
1626	premarin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	menopause	benefits included stopping hot flashes,night sweats, hair loss, and it made my skin more supple and much less dry.	there were no bad side effects at all with this medication I have been thoroughly pleased with it, i did notice being a bit more thirsty but not really bad enough to speak of or lis as a side effect	my treatment consisted of taking one pill per day

Removed the sense of ""running in concrete."""	At first, sleeping was intermittent and was full of bizarre dreams. This quickly passed.	Effexor was prescribed after Serzone has run it's course. Treated for depression (dysthymia) and anxiety related to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Excellent results compared to Serzone and Paxil.
2130	concerta	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	add	My son had a definite and rather dramatic increase in his ability to focus at school, complete his homework and we even saw a difference in his sports performance.  He went from grades averaging C's, with some lower, to A & B's for most classes within just a couple of months.  Even his teachers were very impressed with the difference, and my son's confidence improved tremendously.	The side effects have been very mild. At some points he seems more argumentative and high strung, but not most of the time.  Generally this medication has been well tolerated.  We do not administer the medication on the weekends or when he is not at school (during school breaks or during the summer).	The treatment with Concerta is simple - he takes  one pill a day during the school week.  We have semi-annual visits with the Dr. to check on his progress.  While starting the medication, we had to adjust the dosage slowly upward.  But he had maintained the current dose for more than 1.5 years now with good affects.
2587	oxazepam	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	This drug helped me to be able to fall sleep during an extremely stressful period in my life when I simply could not fall asleep.  I had tried many herbal sleep remedies, homeopathics, melatonin supplements, acupuncture and so forth, but the Serax was the only thing that helped me.  Initially during treatment I would be able to sleep 4-6 hours which was a huge benefit to me as I was exhausted from insomnia and stress.	Sometimes I would feel a slight tension in my head the next morning, but this was better than total exhaustion from sleeplessness.  More recently I find that on the rare occasions that I use Serax, I wake up with a headache if I take a full capsule.  I find using a half a capsule seems to work fine without giving me a headache.	My doctor tried various antidepressant type sleep medications to help me to sleep but they did not help at all.  They left me feeling groggy and with a strange disconnected feeling.   We also tried Ambien but this only helped me get about 2 hours of sleep and then I'd wake up and feel strange.  The Serax worked for me to help me fall asleep when I couldn't sleep, and to stay asleep for 4-6 hours.  Also there were hardly any side effects except for the slight headache.  I had no trouble going off the medication during the times when I no longer needed it.  Sometimes I would taper from 1 capsule to 1/2 capsule per night, or one night on and one night off the medication, but most times I simply stopped using it when I no longer needed it.   I still use a half a capsule occasionally when I travel if I have trouble falling asleep.
1918	avelox	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	sinus infection	none	"i ended up in the er, i actually felt like i was dying, tremors to the point i could not walk, tingling in hands and feet, feeling of empending doom, qrs changes on ekg, pvc's on ekg,palpatations in chest. increased heart rate and blood pressure. i will never take this classification of drug again. i had pneumonia in the past and was on levaquin for weeks and had no reaction.
i hope i never feel this way again."	er did ekg, ct scan, lab work and discharged me home later in the day
154	zomig	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine	The benefits of taking Zomig are suppression of migraine/headache pain for at least 12-24 hours.  Sometimes the migraine would return after this time but usually it went away completely until the next attack.	The side effects of taking Zomig for me are inability to wake (if taken before sleeping) and extreme drowsiness/fogginess if taken while remaining awake.	"I can take Zomig to alleviate any headache pain (including hangovers) which is odd because my doctor told me it would only work on migraines.  The sooner I  take it the faster it works.  If I take it and lie down in a dark room it works faster but I have a very difficult time waking up unless a full night has passed.  If I take it during the day and have to be at work it takes much longer to work (around three hours).  It also makes me feel very foggy and I cannot drive. Sometimes I have to take a second dose, but it has always worked after that.  Sometimes if I catch the headache early enough and go to bed I can cut the dose in half and it still works.  It's success seems to be closely tied to the ability to get away from light, sounds and smells that tend to aggrivate the migraine. If I wait too long to take it, nausea sets in and I cannot keep the medication down.  Then I need to take the sublingual dose, which I don't like to purchase because I can't divide the doses at all.  
I am very happy to have a medicine that alleviates the extreme migraine pain but I wish it didn't make me so drowsy because that still cuts into my productivity."
3135	geodon	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	bi-polar disorder	The benefits are numerous. With the Geodon I haven't suffered from a bout of depression in app. 2 1/2 yrs.. Before the Geodon I suffered from depression for months at a time. I haven't been or felt suicidal at all since beginning the drug. With Geodon I am on an even keel. By that I mean that I do not suffer from the peaks and valleys of typical bi-polar disorder. I no longer have manic episodes for days and then sink into a dark depression. It has made most of my bi-polar traits go away.	The side effects are: dry mouth, possible headache,	The treatment for me is to take 2 80mg capsules of Geodon daily and follow up with a psychiatrist.
245	wellbutrin-xl	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	anxiety and depression	The best , BEST thing about Wellbutrin is that I have my sex drive back fully and I am realizing how much I missed it. That has been fantastic. I have noticed some appetite suppression too, which seems to sort of come and go, but it's definitely a welcome side effect. I have been able to get A LOT done at work, which is never a bad thing, but it's also unpredictable thus far. I also enjoy not having to deal with the nausea and overall sickness I would experience if I missed a dose of Zoloft.	I'm still sorting out the side effects. I keep having waves of anxiety and depression interspersed with days of feeling great. I have noticed I'm more quick to anger, which isn't really all that bad. Makes me realize I'm FEELING things fully. I have had some difficulty sleeping and loss of appetite, sometimes good, sometimes a little alarming.	I decided that I wanted to go off Zoloft because, while on it, I still experienced some depressive episodes and a terrible loss of libido. I felt out of control and wanted to reclaim that part of myself so I tapered slowly off of Zoloft... which was very difficult, as it can make one very very sick, with flu-like symptoms. While tapering off I began taking the 150 mg dose of Wellbutrin. I still don't feel 100% treated, if one ever can, but I am happy to have myself back, even if I'm not always as good as I want to be!
4138	percocet	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acl surgery	The benefits of percocet were that it did take away my pain from my knee surgery, but I felt it needed to be stronger toward the end of the 5 hours.	My side effects were mild itching. It drove me crazy, I had to switch to a differnt pain medication.	I had to take 2 pills every 5 hours.
550	taclonex	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	psoriasis	this was the only ointment that improved my psoriasis.  I applied the ointment to my patches of psoriasis and felt immediate relief of the burning and itching associated with psoriasis	none at this time.	apply ointment to areas of skin before bed - use sparingly a small dab rubbed into the scales works wonders
4149	percocet	3	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	pain management after sugery	Reduction in pain. It pretty much wiped out the pain.	I wanted to scratch my skin off, I went crazy.  They stopped the med. right away and gave me vicodin.	It seems every time I am treated for pain in the hospital they want to give me percocet.  The reaction is very quick and seems to affect my arms the most.
1088	effexor	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	"While taking Effexor at the 37.5mg dose, I have noticed some improvement in my mood stability throughout the morning.  I felt less anxious during the day, but anxiety creeps in again towards the night.  Although I felt MUCH happier and more like my ""old"" self on the higher dose, the 37.5mg dose allowed me to sleep the night, which was not possible at the higher dose."	Upset stomach was common if I forgot to take it with food.	My doctor prescribed due to depression and anxiety.  As mentioned above, I felt so much better on the higher dose (75mg?)... but was unable to sleep at night for several weeks on this dose.  Therefore, I began again at the lower (37.5mg) dose (after trying a few other antidrepressants).  Overall, I am currently unhappy with the effects of the lower dose.
1394	pamelor	7	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	musle relaxant	As I  was able to relax my headache  almost disappeared. The headache was due to stiff jaw syndrome. The symptoms should ease after two months but I feel relief the first day I start taking medicine. I was able to concentrate again and the most important I did not feel tired.	I felt sleepy. I put about 3kg weight. After 2 months side effects ease and then disappeared.	take 40mg of the medicine every night before slip.
543	trazodone	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	waking early	Never had a problem falling asleep but would wake to early and Trazodone makes me sleep thru the night without waking early and after 7 to 9 hours of sleep I feel fine in the morning. Wonder drug where I've never had to increase the dosage for same effect over 18 years.	Annoyance of having to call doctor for refills and go to pharmacy for 18 years	75mg. before bedtime and I sleet thru the night every night for 18 years. Once in a while I would forget to take it and not know that until I woke early and concerned why it was'nt working that night, but next morning I would see the 1/2 pill still on the table with a glass of water. To me it was the best unintended test of whether I still needed it, I did.
1280	provigil	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	central sleep apnea related fatigue	Provided increased alertness and perceived cognitive enhancement. Helped me maintain focus and motivation at work. I still drank coffee throughout the day but it was significantly less with Provigil. Prior to Provigil I was prescribed Adderall XR 20 mg. which really had a negative effect on my duty performance. I had TOO much energy and jitters and could not focus on anything for more than 5 minutes. The opposite of what it was prescribed for.	I began having stomach troubles with this drug. I now take Prilosec and Pepcid to counter this. Worth it? Sometimes. Like other reviews here, I found that the positive effects did wear off by the end of the day and dosing again is not smart if you want to get any sleep at all. In addition, I notice increased heart rate at times and seems to exacerbate the frequency and strength of my PVCs.	I do like the increased alertness and cognitive enhancement but not sure how Provigil is effecting my heart in the long term.
3836	lumigan	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	lashes	longer,thicker,darker lashes,as well I applied it on the eyebrows	mild itching and irritation at the beginning,later disappeared	applied 1 drop to the each eye daily in the evening,very effective,took few weeks to grow new lashes,but it was worth waiting,used disposable applicators daily to prevent eye infections,as well applied to the brows growth line

After i switched to seasonique a few weeks ago, i lost my appetite and lost weight. I dont eat nearly as much now. Im 5'0'' and before i switched i used to weigh roughly around 115... now im sticking around 105. i have no experience with the bad side effects with seasonique	none	one pill a day at the same time

I sleep less on them.	Loss of weight, considerably, feeling sick.  They made me stop sleeping so much, but and hour after taken dem id feel so tired.  I normaly have a high very very high libido, but since being on dem it has dropped considerably, and having an orgasm is hard and not as good.  I've found im very short tempered, and anxiety levels can get quite high at times.	to stay on dem till im in a better place
444	lorazepam	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	panic attacks	"Instant calm. During a panic attack my heart would race, I had numbness and tingling in my fingers, and my vision would ""grey out"" like I was going to pass out. As if that wasn't enough fun I experienced shortness of breath, too. Now when I have a panic attack I take 1/2 of a 1 mg pill and within minutes I am calm and focused."	Mild drowsiness, which is ok if you are somewhere stationary. However, my first attack happened on a busy freeway in rush hour traffic. That is not a great time to be drowsy. But thankfully I only need 1/2 of the pill and so far I haven't had any more attacks while driving.	My doctor prescribed ten 1 mg tablets to take on an as needed basis. The prescription was given to me in February 2008 and I still have 1 left and it's August 2008. So roughly, nine tablets in twenty weeks.
1065	botox	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	wrinkles	Wrinkles did disapear, but there was bruising and swelling. It did reduce after a few days, and I noticed the inability to move the muscles in my forehead and around my mouth.	Bruising and swelling. Not sure if it was the way the injections were delivered or because of my tendency to bruise.	The vials were injected around my mouth, eyes, and on the forhead. The effect did last for several months, but I had not been happy about the side effects.
1555	methotrexate	8	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	psoriatic arthritis	"easing of arthritis symptoms, helped alleviate ""flu-like feeling""."	SEVERE mouth ulcers all over the inside of my mouth and down my throat.  Unable to eat or even drink for about one month.  Became extremely dehydrated and went into acute renal failure.	Gave myself a shot once a week.  I think they quit making the injectible Methotrexate, which is a shame.  It works SO MUCH BETTER than the pills.
2756	xenical	8	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	over weight	I now lost 6 kg during 3 months and I can now wear my favorite dress without any hassles.	I always experiencing oily bowel movement. I starved too much.	For the last 3 months that I intake Xenical, I feel the loose of my body, Even though I had this kind of side effects but I have to sacrifice just for my own sake. It's worth it! I love my body now! thanks to Xenical.
3279	zoloft	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	The depression was treated effectively. I felt more normal shortly after starting treatment.	I apparently didn't have any side effects, at least not any listed on the drug information. However, after a period of a couple months, I became completely turned off by sex. After a longer period, I got freaked out by the idea, not good for a married woman. Still I didn't associate it with Zoloft. I spoke with a friend who had taken Zoloft as well, and she stated that she was 'running' from her husband regarding sex and changed meds. I also requested a change to another anti-depressant and no longer have a libido problem.	I was suffering from clinical depression that manifested itself as overall crankiness, irritability and sore, aching muscles in my shoulders and neck. My doctor prescribed muscle relaxers and x-rayed my neck. No problems. I went to a psychiatrist who diagnosed depression. I was given Zoloft and the irritability and muscle aches went away very quickly.
3195	omnicef	2	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	ear infection	I had to stop the medicine because of the side effects and he got sicker (I know you aren't supposed to stop antibiotics for this exact reason).  He ended up on another antibiotic that worked well.	He's one year old, and his mood changed drastically.  He became agressive and mean.  Clenching his fists, growling, hitting his sister and pulling her hair and being totally uncooperative were our everyday behaviors.  He is normally a laid back, sweet child.  The pediatrition disagrees and says it wasn't the medicine, but I know it was.	He was supposed to take it for 10 days, but the behavior was out of control, so the pediatrition told me to stop it for 24 hours and see if the behavior changed.  I stopped on day 7 and within 18 hours, he started to improve- within 24 hours he was almost back to normal.  The pediatrition and pharmacist both say that it doesn't go to the brain, and therefore can't cause behavior changes, but SOMETHING in that drug definitely effected him.  I know my child and I watched him very carefully, I KNOW it was the antibiotic.  I won't be using it again for either of my children.
3250	triazolam	4	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sedation dentistry for dental implants	Made dental implants possible	The triazolam seemed to stay in my system for days. I experienced a moderate degree of memory loss. There were also a couple instances of loss of cognitive reasoning, which was most frightening.	"I had total dental implants, which involved removing my existing deteriorating teeth (full set) and then placing first, temporary titanium posts into my upper and lower jaws and then permanent posts. A series of temporary acrylic ""teeth"" were fashioned to fit onto the temporary and permanent posts until my gums healed. Then permanent porcelain teeth were attached to the implant posts."
3288	zoloft	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	depression, clinical level	it gave me back my life. Since taking this my brain chemicals are balanced. Several times I have tapered down and twice, off, and the effects have been terrible. For me, I have a depression that cycles me into such a deep dark place that it is terrifying. I was suicidal and had great despair. THe only thing that changed was taking this medication. I know it does't work for everyone but for me, it waas and continues to be a lifesaver. I am very very thankful everyday.	It takes a few weeks for your brain to become right. I would have a flash of vertigo now and then, but that's it. Nothing else.My body is obviously not able to make the amount of seritonin required. It is genetic.	"I began on the tiniest amount, 50 mg. once a day. It was not at all effective. I was upped to 100 mg. daily and that made a difference. Afer about 6 months, at my request, the dosage was upped to 150mg. daily. This held me for 7 years. Then I crashed again. The doctor upped it to 200 mg., taking 150mg in the morning and 50mg at bedtime. This has worked for me for many years. 
Once you pull out of a depression, which is a very physical thing for me, and you can experience a life that is not defined by how gray to black it is, it is humbling. I can now experience tasting food, having a sex life, feeling joy, and actually bound out of bed. My energy is normal. 
Anyone who claims that they pop antidepressants for kicks as if they were uppers or downers has got to be making it up. If you have ever experienced true clinical level depression and then had the gift of taking this medication and for the first time really having a life like everybody else,  you would never ever abuse it. It is so precious to feel normal for the first time. I will take this medication for the rest of my life.
This must be how it is for people who take insulin. It's about getting your personal body chemistry righted."
436	imitrex	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	migrane	My migraine intensed but then subsided within 2 hours of taking this medication.	When you receive this medication it comes with a patient information pamphlet giving each side effect for the drug and i experienced every side effect there was. At first I experienced heat flushes, then slight muscle spasms, 45 minutes into this drug's effect I experienced a tightness in my neck. This scared me because i thought i was having an intense allergic reaction to the drug. Then, there was a lot of pressure in my head so i then took an Aleve and that pretty much eased everything out. I will never take this medication again.	Was given once for a migraine treatment option.
296	vesicare	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	overactive bladder	Urinary frequency and urgency have been substantially reduced; I have a vastly improved lifestyle because these problems no longer inhibit my activities.	I experienced mild constipation in the beginning but because I eat a vegetarian diet I have been able to manage this side effect easily by increasing dietary fiber.  No other measures have been necessary.	My gynecologist changed me to Vesicare when I complained about side effects from the previous Rx I was on for overactive bladder.  (These were dry mouth and constipation.)  After beginning to take Vesicare daily, I noticed an immediate improvement, i.e., sharp decrease in the negative side effects.  I plan to continue the use of Vesicare because there seem to be no prohibitions to its long term use.  It may also possibly postpone surgical repair of the pelvic prolapse.
502	paxil-cr	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety/ibs	Significantly and quickly reduced anxiety (within 2 weeks). In turn, digestive problems (IBS) related to anxiety were significantly improved. Greatly improved my quality of life.	"As long as treatment was taken consistently, side effects were minimal. This medication does not seem to mix well with alcohol - memory loss and increased intoxication were experienced when alcohol was consumed. If a dosage was missed, side effects included unpleasant sensory experiences (like electrical sparks, ""zapping""), dizziness, and disorientation. A strong cautionary statement: withdrawal from this medication may be extremely unpleasant. The overall experience I had with this drug was diminished only by the harsh symptoms associated with discontinuing the drug. The effects included heightened irritability, and strong sensory effects described previously. The drug dosage should be tapered; I quit taking the drug ""cold turkey"" and in retrospect it was a poor choice. I estimate that it took a couple months to stop experiencing the withdrawal symptoms."	A single 10 mg dose was taken daily. I logged my progress by journaling my emotional and physical state at various points in the treatment.
1295	zocor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	elevated cholesterol	Blood tests taken after 3 months showed reduced choloesterol, LDL and increased HDL My initial levels were not terribly elevated but are now totally normal. When I tried going off the medication for a few months my cholesterol went up again. I then returned to taking the pills. I watch my diet carefully and take omega 3 but it has not lowered my cholesterol sufficiently.	There were no side effects that I am aware of. My husband has now also begun treatment after trying diet only.	When first given the simvastatin, my doctor had me take it only every other day and after 2-3 months my blood tests were fine. Later, when I moved and changed doctors, I was told that one cannot take it any less than daily and so that is what I now do. At first I also took the pill in the morning as no one informed me that it is best taken in the evening. There seems no difference in effectiveness.

2863	aldactone	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	adult acne	My acne cleared within one to two months and did not return while I was taking the drug.	I noticed thinning of my hair. This is the only reason I stopped taking the drug, because my hair is naturally very fine iin texture and the thinning was more noticable than if my hair was of a thicker texture.	Interestingly, if I took four 250mg doses per day, the drug was not as effective in treating my acne.
3366	lipitor	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high cholesterol	"serum cholesterol lowered from 320 (combined ldl and hdl) to 188 after six months of initiated treatment.  Cholesterol levels high due to genetic predisposition.

2757	xenical	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	obesity	Cholesterol went from 265 to 199.  Lost 32 lbs. in 3 months.	One incident of an oily stool.	I took part in a 3-month Obesity/Binge Eating study back in 2004 which included the use of a Placebo or Orlistat (Xenical) conducted by a local Hospital/Medical Center. I would meet with the doctor's weekly and was put on a low-fat diet and asked to do moderate exercise of 30-40 minutes 3 days a week during this study. At the time I was Age 39, 5 ft 7 and 200 lbs. and a cholesterol level of 265 (you had to have a BMI of 30 percent in order to participate in study, and I just made it per the weight and height chart). Half of the study participants were put on a placebo pill and half were put on Orlistat (Xenical). They did not tell the participants during the study if they had the placebo or if they had the Orlistat. At the end of the 3 month study, I lost 32 lbs. (down to 168 lbs.) and my cholesterol went from 265 to 199. I was told at that time I was taking Orlistat. The participants who took Orlistat lost more weight than the ones who took placebo and did the low-fat diet. I can only remember once having what may have been an oily stool. I never had cramps, diarrhea or any type of bowel accidents. It is now 2010, and I have put on 20 lbs. since. I am considering trying to get my family doctor to prescribe Orlistat. I have not heard anything negative about the medication, except for the side effects of oily stools, etc. I believe the people who have experienced the bad side effects are people who are continuing to eat fatty foods (such as pizza, cheeseburgers, etc.) and continue to take the Orlistat. If you follow the directions, you are to eat low-fat and also take a multi-vitamin. I look forward to trying out the Orlistat again. :)

922	paxil	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	paxil took away my anxiety and made me feel very comfortable on social gatherings.  took away my depression also.	constantly tired, napped everyday, gain 30 lbs.	paroxatine will pretty much walk you thru life with a ho hum attitude and nothing will bother you.  you will gain weight and there is nothing you can do for it.  as far as trying to quit the drug you will go through hell and back before you come out of the woods.  my advice is don't try it to begin with. use paroxatine as a last chance method. i finally successfully quit.
1594	xanax	5	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar disorder/panic attacks	There were some good benefits, such as it would relax me and was able to get a good nights sleep.I felt more confident when taking this drug as it dulls your senses and changes everything into a positive.After a couple of months I became dependant on xanax as it made me feel good about myself.	There are many side effects that I experienced at different times.The worst side effect was that I would go into a rage and yell at my partner for the littlest things.Even though I was aware how bad I was,the anger inside of me took over and there wasn't any control.The morning dose always made me tired for the rest of the day, so I only took half a tablet to be able to function during the day.It is also a depressant which did not help me and is so ADDICTIVE that you actually fret about getting your next prescription.	Xanax is used to treat a number of illnesses such as Bipolar, Panic disorder and insomnia.It is effective but also has some serious side effects and in the end you have to outweigh the good against the bad. Normal dosage for Biploar and Panic disorder is 2 mg twice daily, which is a very strong dose.In the first few months that you take it be aware that it makes you extremely tired and on several occasions I have fallen asleep in public places!
996	armour-thyroid	8	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroid	increased energy (moderate), weight stabilized	none noted	"perimenopausal symptoms initiated this prescription.  Medication benefit seemed small, but just enough to balance me out.  I haven't needed to increase since I started.  Thyroid tests always show me with a ""perfect"" level since I've been taking it.  I'm very drug sensitive and have noticed no side effects.  The only drawback is having to wait 1/2 hour after taking before I can eat each day.  Other than that, it's great - it's even inexpensive to buy!"
3181	desyrel	5	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	insomnia	Held me in a deep sleep and my muscle pain subsided.	"Grooginess in the morning. Low libido. Water retention with edema. I didn't realize it was the medication that caused the edena until I quit taking it. When I started back on the medication I immediately swelled with edema.

Initially, it was working well, then I developed weight gain and terrible edema in my ankles and legs. Sometimes it didn't make me sleepy and I doubled my dose. It literally made me green with nausea, but I was able to sleep."	"Lighter doses didn't work. My doctor gradually upped my dose until it was high enough to be effective. After 5 years, I decided to quit taking the medicine cold turkey. This was five months ago because of the low libido. I was a basket case, but it was out of my system in about four days. I later found out that you should go off it gradually with a doctor's supervision. Quitting, as I did, could cause you to be suicidal. It certainly was very difficult on me. 

During my time drug free, I developed anger issues, depression and wanted to hurt myself. My sleep became light again, causing muscle pain from lack of rest.

After several months drug free, I restarted the medication for insomnia. Immediately my ankles and legs swelled greatly with edema. The water retention and edema is still there even after several days of discontinuing the medication. Maybe this is because I took a high dosage. I plan to go back to my doctor and try something different."
679	accutane	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne  and scarring	cleared the face of acne and some improved appearance of scars	skin peeling and dry and chapped lips	I took 50 mg a day for 4 months as a last resort for acne. was quite effective with moderate side effects
443	lorazepam	10	Ineffective	No Side Effects	anxiety	THE BENEFITS WERE NONE.  HOWEVER, IT DID NOT CAUSE ME ANY DIFFICULTIES OR SIDE EFFECTS.  I APPROVED OF THE IDEA OF TAKING THE MEDICATION TO REDUCE MY GENERAL LOW LEVEL ANXIETY AS AN ADDITIONAL TREATMENT TO LOWERING MY HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. BUT I EXPERIENCED NO IMPROVEMENTS AT THIS DOSE.	THE IDEA WAS TO HELP WITH ANXIETY AS AN AID TO LOWER MY BLOOD PRESSURE.  HOWEVER, NEITHER MY BLOOD PRESSURE, WITH ANOTHER MEDICATION, OR THE LEVEL OF ANXIETY WAS REDUCED.  THE LORAZEPAM WAS STOPPED AFTER A WEEK WHEN I COMPLAINED OF INEFFECTIVENESS. I DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY SIDE EFFECTS WITH THIS MEDICATION.	I WAS TO TAKE THIS MEDICATION ONCE A DAY IN THE MORNING.  WHEN I FELT NO BENEFIT I DISCUSSED IT WITH THE DOCTOR WHO SUGGESTED AN INCREASE OF THE DOSAGE.  I DECLINED.  THE TREATMENT THEORY WAS THAT THE LORAZEPAM WOULD HELP ME WITH ANXIETY AND STRESS WHICH IN TURN WOULD BE AN AID IN ADDITION WITH THE BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION TO LOWER MY BLOOD PRESSURE.
3014	cipro	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	yeast infection	The drug helped elminate most of the discharge and healed my yeast infection mostly.	i was feeling a bit tired and drowsy.	"after taking the drug for 2 weeks most of the infection had cleared up.
I think having the drug for another week or two would have cleared up the infection completely."
2291	lexapro	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	The treatment benefits include less shakiness, stable mood, calm stomach and overall stability.	I have not noticed any side effects. I have noticed that if I am inconsistent with taking the medication regularly I will feel anxious or moody. If I drink alcohol the medication does not seem to counteract the anxiety.	After the birth of my daughter I suffered from what seemed like acute anxiety attacks. Coupled with my unpredictable mood cycle and my inability to control my emotions my doctor recommended 10mg of Lexapro daily combined with talk therapy.
1010	fentanyl	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	chronic regional pain syndrome	Alleviated pain in the affected area of the arm. Reduced all other symptoms also of Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome. Allowed me to get a good noghts sleep without waking and needing to shower due to excessive sweating which is symptomatic of the condition.	Side effects were chronic constipation, for which I was prescribed Lactulose, headaches which would last for days, disturbed sleep patterns, vivid dreaming. The inability to concentrate for even moderate periods of time, dry mouth and sluggishness.	The patches were prescribed following a consulatation with the local pain clinic and unsuccessful nerve blocks performed by both the pain clinic and the fracture consultant. After 6 months of side effects I decided to stop using the patches as I felt that the relief in pain was not matched by the quality of life provided by the use of the drug
2966	niaspan	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	low hdl	my hdl has gone up. i am still taking niaspan and feel like it is helping.	i did have some flushing at first...however that did not last very long, nor were the symptons too bad.  other than that i have had no side effects	i take 1 1000 mg pill every night.  along with the medication i have improved my diet, lowered my fat consupmtion and added 30 mins of walking every day.  I feel the niaspan has helped my hdl blood count considerable.
2300	lexapro	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Improved mood. I suffered for 20 years with depression and anxiety and minor mood swings.  Since taking the current medications I have a much more stabel mood.  I occasionally have days with more depression.  Before taking the meds, I was almost non functional, not wanting to do anything, feeling helpless and hopeless and at times suicidal.  Now, I rarely ever have even fleeting thoughts of that.	constipation, sleep disturbance.  The constipation has been severe, requiring stimulant laxatives about twice a week.  I also believe that I have had an increase in appetite.  At times I wonder if my memory is as sharp.  Overall, I have had minimal side effects.	continue to take the above medications for chronic depression. I tried an antidepressant first for a long time with a number of changes.  I was also given klonopin for sleep.  I could not take it during day because of sleepiness and lethargy.   Later they added Adderall as I have also fibromyalgia.  This helped the depression and low energy.  I continued to struggle with my condition even though it had improved a little.  Lamictal was added and later abilify.  I have tried to decrease dosage or stop some of these and almost immediately my mood is depressed.
572	atenolol	8	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	hypertension	Effective in reducing hypertension from previous approximately 170/85 to less than 150/65 and now even less at approximately 130/65	"Side effected included sleepiness, and unaccountably nausea while sailing. Prior to taking this drug I had never had problems with ""seasickness"" while sailing. I found I had to stay topside during sailing times.  Other than that, the tiredness was a factor which became less noticeable with time.  The seasickness would not be a problem for the majority of people, I am sure"	Treatment was 1 pill per day for approximately 3 years (25 mg) which I am told is a quite low dose for this medication.  However my weight is 100 lbs on average and small build so for me it was more than enough.  It helped my hypertension come back to within normal range which I was pleased with.  If I needed to go back on an antihypertensive, I would try it again
3400	proscar	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	male pattern baldness	Decent hair growth and consistent prevention of futher hair loss.	Some sexual side effects, but can't be sure if it is the finasteride. At any rate, 1/4 of a 100mg Viagra seems to make sure that side effect is overcome.	I've been taking finasteride generic (1-2 mg daily) for several years now, after taking Propecia for a number of years. It's definitely cheaper, and seems to work just as effectively.
173	zomig	9	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	migraine	Within minutes, migraine disappears 98% of the time.  If I wait too long to take medication, it reduces the chances of eliminating the migraine.  Without Zomig, I would have a lot of sick days from work.

1006	darvocet-n	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	pain relief after outpatient hernia surgery	initial drowsiness	After 12 hours from the first dose, I experienced dizziness even lying down, then nausea. I threw up periodically for the subsequent 12 hours, until it was completely out of my system.	"Propoxyphene was prescribed with some hesitance by my surgeon, because I am allergic/sensitive to codeine products, and throw up with it as well. The follow-up call from the pre-op nurse advised me to discontinue (which I had already done) and try Tylenol instead. I had been able to tolerate Darvocet 14 years ago after a c-section. I am petite, at 5'4"" and 104 lbs."
1708	retin-a-micro	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Helped with clearing up my skin and keeping in clear.  It also helped with fine lines around the eyes and mouth.	At first my skin was very sensitive, dry and flaky.  After approximately 4-6 weeks all the side effects disappeared, my face cleared and has stayed that way.  It has however made my skin extremely sensitive to the sun.	After washing my face at night, I was to wait around 15 minutes before applying a small pea size amount all over my face and neck.

3746	lamictal	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	bipolar	This took all my depression. I fought suicide constantly, read self help books, went to therapy, etc. I took this pill and noticed suicide never ever crossed my mind. In fact, I felt normal for the first time in my life. I was diagnosed with kidney cancer shortly after and a biopsy from hell that has made me almost homebound and terribly disabled. Yet, I don't have depression. I have every other emotion. I definitely learned quick that sadness is NOT depression.	Unfortunately the last month, I feel very nervous. Now, it hurts me to focus on anything visually. I can't describe it but it's like the nerves in my brain. I hear this sound in my head like a car idle with an ocean wave. If I breath very deep less than a minute it goes away. Since they destroyed my lungs in that biopsy; I don't know if it is nerves or oxygen causing that. I know the vision and nervousness is nerves most definitely. I think I may be developing side effects from Lamictal.	I'm not for sure about the side effects. I sure hate the thought of life without  Lamictal!I am really suspecting it, though.
1680	claritin	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	allergies	Allergy symptoms subsided fairly quickly.	There were no detectable side effects.	Allergy was caused by exposure to multiple cats in the household in which patient lived. The first year or two the patient had to take pills every day due to severity of allergy symptoms, which included runny nose, sneezing, red, watery eyes. Later, when the patient moved to a place without carpeting and with build-in humidifier (same number of cats -3) the outbursts of allergy diminished. Now she takes one pill on a as needed basis, which is approximately 2-3 times a month.
2223	allegra	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	seasonal allergies	Totally stopped my allergy symptoms during the fall and spring	I experienced no side effects at all	swallow one pill each morning on an empty stomach during the early fall and late spring
2671	prinivil	5	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood pressure	It did lower my BP some	I'm not sure if the drugs did this, but I have severe tinnitus now, and it's driving me crazy!	I definitely have to have synthroid, because once I stopped taking it, and I couldn't get out of bed I was so tired.

2684	prinivil	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	hypertension	Reduced BP a few points.	Tinnitis (very load and annoying), leg and back pain, headaches, no coughing however	Started on Lisinopril(20mg)/HCTV(12.5mg) and after 5 days the leg and back pain, headache, jumpiness were unbearable.  Doctor assumed potassium loss due to the dieuretic and took me off the HCTV and went with Lisinopril(20mg) only once per day.  The side effects continue well past the time when the HCTV should be out of my system.   I am going to the doctor tomorrow and want off this drug completely.  Plan to use diet and exercise to lower my BP.
306	protopic	1	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	eczema	none - the benefit was supposed to be due to the fact that it wasn't a steroid cream	burning and itching worse than the eczema - I'd have to race to the shower and wash off remaining product - it was terrible	"apply twice daily

10	nasonex	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergies	My son suffered from headaches that would really affect his daily activities. He was prescribed the Nasonex to control his allergies and reduce his sinus symptoms that may have been contributing to his headaches. After about 2 weeks of daily use of the nasonex, his headaches were occurring siginificantly less often and he felt much relief. He was able to reduce his use of ibuprofen which I was really glad for because I worried that he may have rebound headaches from over-use of ibuprofen. I also worried that he may develop an ulcer from using the NSAID's so frequently. He was also able to get a better nights sleep. That improved his performance at school and his general energy level. Previously he was always tired during the day, after he started taking the nasonex continuously, as directed, he felt more energetic, and had many less headaches, too.	At first, the nasal spray was a little irritating to the nose, and he would sneeze after the administration. He just didn't like the spray into his nose. He stuck with it and after about 5 days, it didn't bother him anymore. other than that, we have not noticed any negative side effects of the medication.	He takes the nasal spray in the morning and at night-2 sprays each. It controls his allergies and he no longer suffers from the sinus headaches that were interfering with his life on a daily basis.
14	proquin-xr	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	possible uti - i think?	There were no benefits of taking this medicine unless you count the fact that now I know I should NEVER take this medicine again. I'm severely allergic to it.	Swelling of the face, tingling, itchy eyes, and tighness of chest/difficulty breathing.	I went to the doctor for back pain. My UTI test came back negative except my leukocites were up. I guess she prescribed this to me to be cautious. I took one dose and ended up in the emergency room within an hour. I am now the proud owner of an epi-pen!
2564	klonopin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	anxiety	"decreased anxiety

402	restasis	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	chronic dry eyes	significantly improved dryness of eyes	none	Have had chronically dry eyes for years. Regular eye drops helped temporarily (but blurred vision). Also had Herrick plugs, which seemded to help for awhile. Then doc finally recommended Restasis, and eyes have become much less dry. Very pleased with the results of the treatment.
1024	vyvanse	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	add	"Decreased lethargy and ""overwhelmed"" feeling, increased focus and energy. Did not give me a jittery feeling like adderol.  The doctor said that the medication should wear off in about 12 hours after taking it.  This is true for the increased energy but I notice increased focus and decreased lethargy until I go to bed. No trouble getting to sleep.  
Nice unexpected effect: increased desire and ease of ""connecting"" with freinds and family."	Decreased appitite.  If I don't remind myself to eat I don't get hungry at all.  The couple of times I forgot to eat, I never felt any feeling of hunger.  I just felt spacey and tired and couldn't figure out why.  Then I realized that it was 3:00 and forgot to eat or drink all day.  I have to set an alarm to remind myself that it's time to eat.	One pill daily as soon as I wake up.
4	nasonex	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergy	Reduced sneezing to minimum without making me tired. It worked for my indoor allergies as well as my outdoor allergies	An odd taste in the back of the throat was the only real side effect that I encountered	one spray in each nostril daily was done for 3 months to relieve allergy symptoms. Worked very well. I will probably have to use it year round due to my indoor allergies to dust.
686	accutane	3	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	acne	eventual reduction in acne	made it worse before better, left me with scarring, dry mouth and hair loss	daily tablets
2683	prinivil	4	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	high blood preasure	2blood preasure meds and still prescribed 1 more	some coughing	1 pill every 12 hours,with 300mg labetalol every 12 hours and amlodipine 10 mg 1 per day. i have fatigue and muscle weekness the jury is still out,on why,it is now suggested i have a non alcoholic fatty liver,from a gallblader echo.

It was suppose to work for hayfever, watery eyes. With a severe hayfever attack the pills were of no value or effect.  The pills don't stop the eyes from watering.
2614	adderall-xr	7	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	add management	This does actually help calm you down and help you concentrate. My grades went upby a lot. I was calm and was doing much better on it (much better reffering to the ADD treatment) but there are so many negative side effects. In a way I regret ever taking it.	I developed an anorexia, I stopped eating and lost so much weight. I'm about 5ft. 6 now and weigh about 130 LBS. which is really skinny for my age and height. If I wouldn't have stopped I would be skin and bones. I got to a point where I lost color and I'm now way too skinny. Another side effect that I developed is insomnia. I have a VERY hard time sleeping. I can't fall asleep until about 1:00 and that's every night. It's horrible. Another side effect that's very serious, is development of depression. I had to go on anti-depressants because of the drug about 3 months after using adderall. It depresses you so much. After school I'd get home and be so depressed. I'd cry and just feel so misserable. I was seriously depressed. A fact that everyone should understand about adderall is that it's in a way a wattered down version of meth. The side effects are the same but not as severe. But it's still bad. It will mess up your teeth by giving you a VERY dry mouth, your weight and most of all your brain chemistry. I went from ADD to depression to now ADHD. I'm going back on stimulant drugs like adderall when school starts. I don't know how it'll work out because I now have a tolerance to it. And I'm getting new treatment. I don't know what'll happen or anything. But I just wantto get through school. Anyone that will be perscribbed to this should research on it and get the facts. Research for a long time. Not just one article reading. Get as much info as possible. The side effects are so severe that you should really know what you're exposing yourself to. They're all horrible. Especially the addiction that you get to it. I'm addicted to it and can't stop craving it. I feel like I need it so bad. It's been months and still I want it extremely bad. Be careful what choice you make. It gets the job done. Hut will screw up your life. This is just my experience. It may be different for you but still do your research.	I was on 20 MGS for a while then went up to 40 then more and went back down to 25.
1090	effexor	4	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression/anxiety	Overall mood was enhanced for a few months, then benefits plateaued and disappeared.	Loss of sex drive; Increasing agitation; Heart palpitations making heart murmur much more apparent; Worsening nightmares and night sweats.	"Doctor hoped to wean me off of Xanax by using Effexor as what she called a ""non-addictive"" substitute. Unfortunately, I needed increasing doses of Xanax to counteract some of the side effects of the Effexor. Stopping Effexor resulted in about a week of zero energy and flu-like symptoms, and several weeks of mental confusion and what felt like ""brain zaps""."

1707	retin-a-micro	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	anti aging	smoother skin	dryness	I used Retin A Micro every other day for several months then began using every night.  I noticed a small difference in skin smoothness but my skin was very dry.  I began using it with Revale Skin which is made from the Coffeeberry and noticed that my skin was much more hydrated and my fine lines and wrinkles began to improve.  The Revale helped me tolerate the Retin A and kept my skin hydrated. I have noticed that my sun spots are slightly lighter now.

2911	tramadol	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	sciatic nerve pain	It gave moderate relief to the sciatic nerve pain I was experiencing.  As the severity of the pain lessened, it could totally ease the pain.	I experienced constipation that became worse the longer I took the pain med.	As I began having severe sciatic nerve pain, the doctor prescribed tramadol to help with the pain.  I was also receiving physical therapy and the tramadol helped me to tolerate that until it began to help correct the sciatica.
1702	retin-a-micro	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	reduced acne breakout, redness from breakout went away quickly, smoother skin	flaking, sensitivity to acid products	Cleansed face am and pm.

473	remicade	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	reactive arthritis (presents like ra)	Until Remicade, I wasn't able to sleep without waking from the pain of moving my legs, so I exstatic about that relief.  I no longer have any stiffness, except for when its cold or if I grip something for a while, but it doesn't last for hours like it used to.  The swelling in my joints has signficantly decreased.  Unfortunately, the medicine has not stopped my flare-ups, which only last for a 2-4mnths at a time on a finger joint or toe joint.  Nor has it prevented osteoarthritis in my feet.  I am also struggling to find that right dose that helps with the fatigue.	I got pneumonia after the first treatment and it took 3 months for it to go away.  My breathing hasn't been the same since, I've to see a pulmonary specialist every couple months to manage the constant asthma that I now have.  I have also gained approx 25 while taking the medicine, although it's not supposed to be a side-effect.  This is what bothers me most, extra weight puts more strain in my joints.  I also have frequest yeast infections.  I have almost constant sinus congestion.	I recieve an infusion every 8 wks.  Since I started a year 18 months ago, we have, recently increased the dose and have shortedn the interval at which I recieve the medication.  I use this medicine in conjunction with methotrexate, which I self inject every week, 10ml (I HATE that part).
1167	zofran	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	nausea	none.	"when the mid-wife prescribed me zofran i was having problems with nausea. I couldnt eat, sleep,or drink anything. so she prescribed me zofran when i was 4months and the first week i took zofran i started bleeding and having brown discharge, so i immediately went to go see her and all she told me was that it was normal that my uterus was stretching. so the 2nd week i took it the same things happened worse. this time i was in so much pain that i couldn't walk or anything. so again i went back to see her and she told me that everything was normal it was just my uterus stretching. the 3rd week i had an appointment for an exam. that day i went i told her that i was having more bleeding, more brown discharge, and lots of pain. she did the swab test and again said everything is fine all these things that were happening to me was suppose to happen because my uterus was stretching. then she said "" if anything happens go to the emergency room "". the next day at 5am i was calling 911 because i had a miscarriage. zofran caused me to have a miscarriage. that was my first baby. it hurts so much that i had a mid-wife that was so inconsiderate of what i was telling her and all the complications i was having. she disregarded everything and because of that i lost my first baby."	they were terrible.
2914	tramadol	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	severe abdominal pain yet to be diagnosed	The benefits were almost non-existent. I had taken this med before after a terrible car accident and therefore felt secure enough to take it again this time. However after only one day medicine stopped being effective.	"Some drowsiness at night after taken it throughout the day and some constipation. However after taking it for only two weeks I had a seizure that sent me to hospital and was told by doc there that elavil and tramadol combined can cause seizures! NO ONE told me this. Not my primary care doc, my GI doc or the pharmacist. This seems to me to be a pretty severe ""side effect"" for a medicine that barely works! The two meds were prescribed to me by the same physician and I understand oversights can happen. However if I had known from beginning that seizures might be a possibility I would asked for something else. Also after only two weeks I had some weird effects after stopping usage including diarrhea, cold sweats, hot flashes, restless leg syndrome and anxiety. I never experienced anything like this with any other meds. This medicine is NOT worth it!"	1 to 2 50mg tablets every 4 to 6 hours.
3321	danazol	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	endometriosis	"no period since on Danazol which is good for endometriosis.
the cyst on ovary did not grow since on Danazol.
the side effects are tolerable, do not seem to interfere with daily life."	"had frequent muscle cramps, not just on legs, but on back, neck, even abdomen.

2933	prednisolone	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	asthma	Very rapid reduction in wheezing and coughing.	Water retention under skin making it tender to touch including odd places like the back of the head. Feeling of raised body temperature and heat. Mood changes (feeling positive)	Generally 20mg for 3 days then dropping 5mg per day every 3 days. Once at 5mg the dose is halved every three days. It should never be stopped suddenly.
1101	effexor	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	"Long-term mild to good relief from the worst aspects of depression.  Provided a ""floor"" to my mood and I never go below that.  Prior to Effexor (and before that, Prozac) I had frequent periods of suicidality.  I still often get very depressed but am much more functional and my behavior has stabilized."	The inability to drink more than 2 glasses of wine at a time!	Effexor was first prescribed by psychiatrist and then by psychopharmacologist.  I see the psychopharmacologist every 3 months for 1/2 hour to evaluate the efficacy of meds.
4104	chantix	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	smoking cessation	Long-time smokers finally have something to help them stop smoking and not have the headaches and the withdrawals!	The only side effect that I had was strange dreams for the first few nights.	Every day you are to take Chantix once in the morning and once at night, and set a date to stop smoking. That is what I did, and I set my date at ten days after I starting taking the medication. In less time than ten days, I was not reaching for a cigarette with my morning coffee. I stopped smoking all together in two weeks, but took the medication for four months. When family and friends that are smokers would come over, I would want to smoke with them. I restarted the program twice, then told myself I would just have to NOT smoke with them.
1681	claritin	7	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	spring allergies, allergy cough	I only took it one time, and experienced a side effect (dry mouth). Did not really kick in, but I guess this med. is not supposed to work immediately	I had a dry mouth and my eyes were dry.	Basically I had allergies and severe allergy seasonal cough. Doctor told me to try Claritin. I only took it once just to see if the drug would work. The drug did not work right away. As it is stated in the label, this drug takes time (perhaps about a week) in order to be effective. I ended up not taking anything. As soon as mid June came around, the allergies and cough that lasted about 3 months all went away.
2107	renova	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne & sun damaged skin	The skin texture appears improved after only 4 weeks of use. I have much acne less breakouts and day by day I see a steady improvement. My skin is much smoother than before and starts having a beautiful glow (which it hasn't had in years!)	I did have slight skin irritation during the first 2 weeks of use and after the second week I started having a few acne cysts (which is apparently a normal skin reaction during the first weeks of treatment). Nevertheless, I asked my doctor to put me on minocycline in order to avoid additional acne scars. This combination (Retin-A-Micro & Mincycline) works wonders!	I apply a thin layer of retin-a-micro gel every night after cleansing on my face and onto the acne prone areas on the chest. In order to avoid skin irritation, I used as little gel as possible during the first weeks. I think this is why I had only minor side effects. My skin has started to be used to the medication and I therefore can now use a bit more (though still a thin layer).
3565	differin	6	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Exfoliates the skin. It is said to prevent or treat acne and acne scars. whether this is true is questionable.	the drug induced some dryness and flakiness especially around the nose area and chin area. this side effect can go away after a while	the product is a gel that is put on every night. it supposedly prevents new  blemishes and promotes exfoliation. the results for the blemishes were not satisfactory.
3958	prilosec	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	This medication provided me with total relief from heartburn. It is normally taken  daily, 1/2 hour before breakfast.	There were no sside effects.	This generic version of Prilosec OTC can be taken daily  on a long term basis to prevent/control the symptoms of acid reflux. It is very easy to remember to take it, as it is normally taken at the same time every day-- before breakfast.
1995	vicodin	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	diverticulitis / kidney infection	reduced the intensity of the pain and allowed for rest to recuperate	I had no queasiness or nausea, no jittery feelings. No hives.	"I had severe diverticulitis with a kidney infection. I was hospitalized for a week and taking antibiotics and pain medication for two weeks after my release. Of course in the hospital morphine was administered for the pain management, but hydrocodone/acetaminophen was prescribed upon my release. I took the 10/500 which was more cost effective because I was able to break them in half to be less damaging to the kidneys and liver.
I have taken other pain medication which gave me hives, made me have nausea or become jittery.  I had no side effects from taking this medication or addictive desires to continue it after the infection was cleared up."

577	lithium-carbonate	7	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar	I have found that I have been able to sleep better and my thoughts do not race like they did when I was not taking the lithium.  It has not made me as tired or hungry as other meds have which was a welcome surprise.  Still not able to focus as well as I had hoped.  I work full-time and hold an aditional part-time job and was worried that I was not going to be able to continue with these prior to beginning with this treatment.  I have been managing better since taking the lithium.	Blurry vision to the point where I now have to wear glasses.  My skin has acne and I didn't have it before.  I have to use a prescription to controle it.  My acid reflux is terrible and i have to use a prevacid to control that.  My skin is very dry and it has become so bad that if i don't moisturize it will bleed.  Mild tremmor.  Slight confusion and inability to concentrate sometimes.  My hair falls out more than it used to.  As my doctor says: it's a dirty drug.  However, I'm not a zombie and I can sleep so I can learn to live with the above.	I started at 150mg and slowly went up by 150mg every time the side effects calmed down.  Usually when I stopped tasting the metallic taste in my mouth I would increase the dose.  I've been on toprimate 400mg for one year.  Therapy with my psychiatrist twice per week (sometimes once per week due to scheduling conflicts).
1432	tirosint	6	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroidism	It seemed to stabilize my metabolism.	I didn't seem to see any and was frequently not sure if I was actually getting the right dose.  It took about 3 years to get the current dose right.  And since that time I haven't changed it.  I have found out that the dosage I am taking is the very least amount I can take and still take thyroid medicine.	I take one thyroid pill a day.  I did originally take Synthyroid, but changed to the generic brand about 5 years ago to save on total costs.  Since I have been on generic brands, the shape of the pill has changed.  Also, so has the directions on taking it.  Now I can hardly take it and have it be effective, because I have to take the pill on an empty stomach, with a full glass of water, in the morning, and I can't have anything that might interfere with its absorption for 4 hours -- such as food, vitamins, or any other medicine.  So I do not know if it is effective or not, since I would have to try and take it in the middle of the night.  I am not going to do that, so I take it at night before going to sleep --- without a full glass of water.
290	panixine-disperdose	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	I had severe acne for many years and I was sort of living with it without seeking cures seriously. I tried a couple of other anti-biotics before but not very diligently. I started to be more disciplined and actually took Keflex every day. In the beginning I was also taking Apri the birth control pill. I took both for a couple of months and my face started to be better in a week or two and completely cleared in a couple of months - which made me so much happier with my life. Then I stop Apri, and I continued with Keflex. And it seems that if I stop Keflex, my acne will come back a little. So I have not tried stoping Keflex for more than a week or two. I am a little concerned with the long term side effects of Keflex although I am not sure whether there should be any. I think I will continue taking Keflex and I will also ask my docotor to test blood or any other things that I should be cautious of.	It is hard to say. I have chronic headaches and general stress. So I am not sure whether the Keflex may have made matters a bit worse sometimes. Overall, I can't seem to correlate Keflex to my other conditions at all.	...
3136	malarone	3	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	malaria prevention	The benefits if I had continued to take the Malarone for the entire two weeks would have been to not contract Malaria.  But the side effects were severe enough that I discontinued treatment and followed other preventative measures.	I had an overall sense of unwellness.  Nausea was constant even when the drug was taken separate from other drugs and with food/on a full stomach etc.  I felt almost flu like; ie the beginning of flu onset when you are not yet fully sick.	When I discontinued use (while still in a Malaria risk area) I relied soley on preventative measures.  I was in a night biting mosquito area (Thailand, Laos and Cambodia) so slept under a mosquito net.  Used mosquito spray in the room and used a special spray for one set of clothing for higher risk environments (ie jungle).  Also spoke with an Asian doctor at length about the Western philosphy vs Eastern for treatment.  His take was that Eastern doctors choose to treat malaria when it is contracted but Western take higher and higher levels of drugs to prevent contraction.  This may lead to drug resistant strains...
3103	ortho-tri-cyclen	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	irregular periods	Periods became lighter and more regular, acne lessened as well.	None.	I took the pill every morning for five years.
2701	detrol-la	4	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	spasdic bladder	As an RN for 14 years, I was familiar with Detrol LA and why it was prescribed for me.  I was diagnosed two years ago with Multiple Sclerosis and have a spastic bladder.  Soon after being prescribed Detrol LA, I had a definite decrease in urination frequency.  However, after about six months, my urinary habits returned to pre-medication levels.  I void every two hours.  About one year ago, I stopped taking Detrol LA for two months, thinking that giving my bladder a break from the med would help.  I then restarted Detrol LA and noticed no difference.  I am seriously thinking about stopping the medication.  It is essentially useless.	Mild dry mouth.  Otherwise, no side effects.	I have been on Detrol LA for since being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis two years ago.  I have a spastic bladder and urinate every two hours.  I take 2mg twice a day.  The medicine worked for about six months, then was virtually ineffective.
3906	nexium	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	laryngopharyngeal reflux	"Total resolution of ""globus"" feeling in throat that was causing difficulty with singing and swallowing.  Also, resolution of sore throat and hoarse voice that I had waked up with for many years."	none that I notice, however, there is a study out that indicates that people over 50 who take proton pump inhibitors are more likely to develop osteoporosis.  I was diagnosed with osteopenia in my late forties, even though I take calcium and exercise.  Then again, I weigh 98 pounds and am very small boned and caucasian so I dont know if the nexium had anything to do with it.	I take a purple pill every morning....that is about it!

4071	mobic	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	tmj - inflamation	I have been SUFFERING with pain almost every day of my life since I went to the dentist and my TMJ was diagnosed. I couldn't find anything to help me with the pain and found this medical condition debilitating. Insurance won't pay for specialists and/or treatments for this condition. My PCP gave me a prescription for this medication and it so far has really really helped the pain. I take it twice a day with a meal (Very important) and the pain level has decreased so much! I know everyone's condition effects them differently but after trying over the counter medications as well as Pain medication prescribed by my PCP this has been the most helpful so far. Thank you Meloxicam!	I have experienced no side effects. I feel a little different at times - more relaxed than anything since it helps with my pain. No problems but you MUST eat when taking this medication I was told since ulcers are common if the medication is not taken correctly.	1 7.5MG pill two times daily with a meal

3975	norvasc	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	chest pain	I was prescribed Norvasc by my cardiologist because I kept having left sided chest pain. My doctor stated it wasn't angina because i'm so young. I had an echo and stress test which were all normal. each day after taking the pill, i find relief in the chest pain for a while, but then after about an hour it will sometimes come back. I have noticed increase in headaches since taking this med which i went to see a neurologist who wanted me to take neurontin but I refuse to take. He stated the headaches have nothing to do with the heart, but i disagree because when i have this chest pain, the headaches usually are there to, and when the chest pain isn't there, the headache isn't there.	increase in headache.	started out the first week with breaking 5mg in half. then after that been taking 5mg daily. B/P was never above 130 systolic and never above 90 diastolic. but was prescibed this because of the intermittent chest pain.
2965	niaspan	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	high cholesterol	My cholesterol was significantly lowered.  From 230 to about 170.  The ratio was excellent.  This effect has consistently been monitored and remains steady.	There was some mild flushing feelings,  without flushed skin.  If the medicine was not taken with food there was an uncomfortable feeling in the stomach about three hours after ingestion.	"Niaspan was prescribed after emergency double by-pass.  My cholesterol began rising at around age 50.  I thought estrogen treatment for menopause would additionally lower cholesterol however it did not.  Significant dietary restrictions,  already in place for many years,  did not lower cholesterol.
I was offered Lipitor, but refused.  A couple of years later I ended up with a bypass,  but without a heart attack."
1771	citalopram	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression and anxiety	The number one benefit was that it helped with the mood swings.  I no longer felt like I was having a mental breakdown.  I felt like I have had more control over my emotions, being that I could be upset and crying one minute and then just fine the next.	I had headaches for several weeks after taking this med.  Along with insomnia.  I also had some mild weight gain.  After being on it for several months I lost my urge to be sexual active.	I was instructed to take one pill a day, keep track of the side effects I was experiencing, then go back in for a re-check to make sure everything was going better.  Everything had gotten alot better, so I continued at the same dosage and am still doing well today.
3826	glyquin-xm	3	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	melasma	My skin has melasma so the treatment was supposed to clear up the brown spots mostly over my cheeks and nose. I didn't have a good experience since those signs are still there.	My eyes used to be kind of itchy and the skin, at the beginning of the treatment, used to be itchy and reddish too.	In association with a glycolic peel (60%) once each 15 days I had Glyquin XM every night for, at least, 3 months. I used Photoderm MAX tint cream FSP 100 during the day.
66	flexeril	1	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	back spasm/pain	It helped with the muscle pain for most of the day.	I was unable to function for the majority of the day it got worse as the day went on. I felt like someone had drugged me. I slept but would feel like I was awake but paralyzed. My speech was slurred and could hardly move. This was all 8 hours into taking the medication. I had not taken a muscle relaxer for about 10 years and now I know why!	I was to take the medicine 1 tablet three times a day.
188	adderall	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	attention deficit disorder	Quality of life improved 10 fold.  Able to follow through with hobbies and interests as well as work.  Before treatment, memory was nonexistent. After treatment not only could I remember things but time itself changed.  Time seemed to move faster.  The body, down to a cellular level, processes toxins faster so skin becomes clear and perfect.	"Hair loss. Hyperthyroid at first then Hypothyroid. The initial weight loss is pretty cool but over time can lead to malnourishment.  Have to be careful not to fall into a ""manic"" mode because it is totally annoying to others.  Also it tends to cause tension in my back.  I've spent much money at the chiropractor over the years.  Otherwise the pain is unbearable."	This medicine changed my life, but there are still spin off's of ADD, like the auditory processing, anxiety and emotional control and general sensitivity that have to be dealt with.  Not to mention health issues like making sure to get enough vitamins (kelp levels out my thyroid pretty well), and picking up a prescription from the doctor every 30 days.  I take 15 mgs AM and 15 after lunch.  Can't take it too late in the day or will cause sleeplessness.
3043	seroquel	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression not resolved with antidepressant drugs	I can not say I can recall any positive benefits.	memory loss and auditory & visual hallucinations even at a dose of 50mg -200mg	I am a 49 1/2 single women who prior to taking an antipsychotic criminal record was clear except for a rare speeding ticket. I also am a professional. I now have a record for criminal retail theft that was reduced to a misdemeanor. I tried abilify next, almost a year later & had the same side effect-memory loss & retail theft. All my life I have been a law abiding citizen with no criminal record until I tried 2 different antipsychotic medications & both caused me memory loss & had a effect on my reasoning. Yes, abilify made my feel real good, but it caused me to enter into a type 2 bipolar manic phase. I am now charged again with retail theft. I feel stongly that the antipsychotics cause these severe memory loss & lack of judgment for actions being commited. I am now 50 years old & can't get a job due to my criminal record.
219	wellbutrin-xl	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	elevation of mood and clarity of thought.  Progress stalled out at 300 mg, but with increase to 450 mg can tell the difference.  I'm able to finally think and plan ahead and chip away at all the clutter I've not been able to deal with which accumulated while depressed.	none at 300 mg.  Possible tinnitus from increase to 450 mg, not evaluated by an audiologist yet though.  Did experience weight loss (7 lbs.) at 450 mg dosage.	Initial treatment included therapy and Lexapro in addition to Wellbutrin XL.  Now only on the Wellbutrin XL.  I see the psychiatrist every 4 months for re-evaluation.
380	lamotrigine	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	epilepsy	To Date Improvements I've noted (but confirmed by closest): Seizures viewed much fewer & shorter.  50% of the seizures merely feelings & no communication loss.  Much more clarity, energy & strength, alertness vs. drowsiness.  Moods much better with smiling even during difficult times.	a little balance, occasional dry mouth	"I've had   20 years of my sedatives & mixes, but my Lamictal on its own has easily become the best for me, & I'm still at a a much lower dose than the average Lamictal taken by my type.  When my family & I discuss the net improvements we smile and even laugh.
I challenge my neurologist with Q's from me or my wife's; he's knowledgeable, thorough,& Q's any mixes."
218	wellbutrin-xl	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	elevation of mood and clarity of thought.  Progress stalled out at 300 mg, but with increase to 450 mg can tell the difference.

3293	zoloft	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	severe clinical depression	I am DEFINITELY more able to manage my emotions and feelings. I can speak on the telephone to people, be in person around people I've never met, and function in society in general. This doesn't sound like a big feat, but I had crippling anxiety and it's a giant step for me.	The first week of my treatment, I had horrible leg cramps and nausea. I actually had to hold a vomit bag while I sat on the couch, and car rides were pretty impossible from motion sickness. But that passed pretty quickly.	I began on 50mg, after growing absolutely sick of feeling terrible all the time. I went on this for about six months, with little difference in my moods. After a suicide attempt (overdose on Trazodone; I no longer take this medication), I was put into a psychiatric ward for a week and my dosage was doubled from 50mg to 100mg, which was one of the best things to ever happen to me.

"the treatment benefits were good because i had mrsa and was hospitalized,then on pills and intravenous drips at the hospital outpatient for 6 days following release from hospital stay,then 2 more weeks on an oral antibiotic after finishing the infusions..that was a wide assortment of meds..mrsa was gone.about a month and a half later,i got mrsa again.but not as severe,but did catch it as it started to feel like a pimple,not a boil..(dont know how i keep getting it.noone in family has/had it.),and was put on doxycycline(reference above) for 10 days,2 x a day,at 100 mg.and followed the directions.i also used on occassion,an antibiotic shower wash,and 100 % pimple cream for the outside..i had 2 boils that quickly faded,and skin healed better,and seemed like it was wiped out.they were about the size of a small dime when started meds this time.by day 3,i felt a lot better,no longer severely itchy where the boils were(common symptom with mrsa),by day 10,they were the size of a grain of sand/rice..it seemed to be gone.now it is 2 weeks later.2 new boils on the same spot an old was ""supposedly healed"" and 1 new spot...so now on doxycycline again for 30 days and following up with physicians...this all started with what was thought a boil.1 boil on my junk,that had to be lanced.i recommend anyone going into a hopspital for a procedure,to be cut,opened,be put on a good antibiotic 1 week before having it done,and then be put on it afterwards for 2 weeks as well..thats my opinion,but maybe it'd help curb the spread.though they deemed mine being community aquired,i tend to doubt it."

1198	prozac	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	The combination of the two drugs helped me cope with my pain and depression, which seem to be related.  I'm able to cope with most of life's difficulties and am not sleeping as much.  With the vicodin helping with the pain, when I do sleep I find it's much more restful and satisfying.  I still have a long way to go and I believe that I will need to take these two drugs for a while as I tried quitting the prozac and immediately resumed the depression.	A little more sleepy and lack energy.  Also, it's obvious with the prozac that I'm at a point that I'm not able to go off of it without replacing it with something.  The vicodin doesn't seem to be a problem with side effects as long as I don't take more than one tablet at a time (500/5).	I've had depression and pain for some time.  They have both caused serious problems in my life.  I found myself isolated and sleeping far too much.  I did some research and found that lack of seritonin could cause an increse sensitivity to pain so I was hoping that my pain would subside with this treatment.  So far, I can't tell the difference.  My doctor seems to be concerned about taking the vicodin but I'm more concerned about the long term effects of the prozac.  Only time will tell.
2963	niaspan	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	high total cholesterol	The medication reduced total cholesterol from about 220 to about 180.  blood pressure appeared to slightly decrease from 125/70 to 115/65. The ration between high density cholesterol (good cholesterol) to low density cholesterol improved significantly.	Initially has hot flashes  red flushing of skin.  However it was discovered that taking the Niaspan before going to bed, with an 81mg enteric coated aspirin entirely eliminated the hot flashes.  There have been some deposits of fatty nodules just below the skin in several locations.  There has not been a causative link between the Niaspan pointed out to me. However since the Niaspan  reduces the circulating amount of a fatty chemical, the appearance of fatty deposits is suspicious.	"Two pills, 1000mg per pill, taken in the evening, with an 81mg enteric aspirin.
It is suggested that no high fat-foods be eaten several hours before taking the Niaspan, since there appears to be some relationship between high fat meals and hot flashes."
975	macrobid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	bladder infecton	Lessened frequency of urination and burning sensation	None	Simply took the macrobid capsules as prescribed and did not notice any negative effects.

3943	prilosec	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	gerd	Stomach had been aching continually for several months, with constant belching andd a feeling of pressure in the upper throat.  Heartburn was not a significant complaint.  I lost about 5 lbs due to a loss of appetite.  I first started on a dose of 20 mg/day, and decided to increase to 40mg/day when the symptoms were not fully alleviated.  That dosage helped the symptoms, but I still have to be careful when, what and how much I eat or the problem will start up.	None really.  however, I am concerned about the correlation to osteoporosis, since proton pumps are probably involved in bone remodeling.  Now I take only 20mg daily as needed.	Take 20mg first thing in the morning about half an hour before breakfast, or before I have a meal I know will cause problems - Italian food, garlic, spicy, etc.

15	proquin-xr	10	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	kidney infection	After the third day, I could tell the pain was subsiding.	Diarrhea and stomach pain	The first dayI started taking the medication 500mg 12 hrs apart. Then my stomach was hurting and I had diarrhea. I decreased the dosage (on my own, which I would not advise others to do) because I have a history of pseudo-membranous colitis, and I need to be cautious of antibiotics. However, I needed the med for the kidney infection. On days 2-5 I took 250mg 3 times a day (eight hrs apart). This reduction in dosage relieved the stomach pain and the diarrhea. After the third day of antibiotics, I noticed a decrease in back pain so I knew the medication was working.

If you looked at me in the daylight, you would say that I had a ""balding problem"" and of course with the transplants I looked strange  After 6 months, it totally covered my crown and increased the texture of the remaining hair to a coarser density.  All of the fine hairs which were dormant came back with stronger and previous-strength follicles.  The transplanted hair on the top also became coarser.  Except in a very strong light looking directly down on the top of my head, now no one would say I was bald or even ""thinning.""

Armour thyroid was the only effective treatment	no treatment side effect for armour until last year when the pharma company decided to change the so called inert ingredients. My TSH jumped from 1.75 to 5.3 after 6 months on the new formulation.	Sadly I have been searching for other hypothyroid meds that will regulate my thyroid and leave me feeling well.

2903	focalin-xr	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	adhd	Focalin XR reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms.  It increased attention and reduced fidgeting.  Also noticed an increased productivity at work and better interpersonal interactions.  Additionally, the XR formulation is easier to take properly because it only has to be taken once a day, versus 3 - 4 times a day for the non extended release formula.	The main side effects experienced included loss of appetite and increased anxiety, especially towards the end of the drug's effectiveness period (about 8 hours).  This is an improvement over short-acting Focalin where these side effect was experienced up to 3xs a day.  I did not experience any other side effects.	Diagnosed with ADHD at 17.  On some form of Ritalin since 17.  Ritalin had too many side effects so used Focalin.  Unfortunately Focalin short-acting required me to remember to take it 3xs a day, and I have ADHD, so the extended release was a much better fit.

1104	effexor	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression and anxiety	Proven effective with adults and was tried with me to combat severe depression, regardless of the fact that it is not normally recommended for adolescents. Though starting at 37.5 mg, the psychiatrist quadrupled the dosages within one month's time to attempt to make a dent on my emotional condition.	As the dosage increased, the lack of effect turned into a complete removal of affect as well as a persistent feeling of listlessness and heaviness (like having weights on limbs and chest).	Though starting at 37.5 mg, the psychiatrist quadrupled the dosages within one month's time to attempt to make a dent on my emotional condition. The month was ended abruptly due to hospitalization for attempted suicide by overdose. I was not weened off of the medication. The doctor was then brought before a committee for misconduct in prescribing Effexor to a minor as well as disregarding warning signs of a suicidal youth. This was the worst month in regards to my depression and anxiety, and was a definite reversal in any progress that was accomplished with a different doctor on a different medication.

I look forward to a 2 year review!"	"I've noticed an increase in sexual desire over this period. I find that I need to have sex at least daily, and or masturbate at least once a day to simply feel relieved and sexually relaxed.

I do need to admit that I'm also using Nisim shampoo. Which has a clinical study reported to be successful. While it only has one ingredient which is thought to regrow hair, Saw palmetto , it's clinical trial after 5 months saw over 80 percent of men regrow hair. It's a stimulant that appears to work, while the shampoo appears to thicken hair. I think it is working in conjunction with propecia to restore my hair."

During the 10 days taking the drug there were no side effects, however the day after the last dosage, I began having severe diarrhea, which persisted and was diagnosed as a bacterial infection called clostridium difficil, caused by the antibiotic I had taken.

2478	enbrel	6	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	rheumatoid arthritis	The psoriasis cleared up a great deal on my hands and scalp, back and feet. The pain level was dramatically decreased and I was able to cut back a lot on the antiflamatory drugs I had to take when I had a bad flareup. I was able to sleep deeper and longer.	I had two one week stays in the hospital with cellulitis and staff. The enbrel lowered my resistance to infection and I was advised to stop the injections. I had bad bruises that lasted for several months. I had a lot of stomach trouble and I started wrinkling on my face and neck. I lost a great deal of hair on my head ,eyebrows, and lashes.	The cost was was $2000.00 for twelve weeks of enbrel, plus I had to have blood work every month and see the rheumatologist every month.  I took two injections at home every week. If I got a cold or fever I had to suspend the injections until I was well or risk serious infections. The risk of cancer was also very high and that was why I eventually stopped . I am already in a high risk group because of both parents and two siblings who have had and died of different cancers.
2611	adderall-xr	9	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	adhd	"Helps me focus at work in the Corporate world.  Also helps me to ""think"" before I blurt out the first thing that comes to mind."	Inability to sleep some nights is the worst side effect.  I take the medicine Monday through Friday and when I take Adderall each Monday, I usually cannot sleep Monday night.  Sometimes I get overly anxious from taking the Adderall.	I was diagnosed with ADHD in college and have taken Concerta, Zoloft, Ritalin and maybe a few others?  I prefer the time release so I do not need to take multiple pills through out the day.

None--until the 3rd to 4th day when I experienced HORRIBLE esophagitis. and heartburn which felt like a big air bubble in the middle of my chest---at first I thought it was a heart attack.	I know this was prescribed because I'm allergic to penicillin and was having dental surgery.  BUT given the side effects and the pain I would NOT take it again.  A pharmacist advised me to take Prilosec q.a.m. and an antacid between doses.  It helped a bit, but I would have asked for another medicine if it had been earlier in the treatment.
2599	ortho-tri-cyclen-lo	7	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	Lighter periods, clearing of acne for the first 6-7 months.	I think it might have made the hair on my scalp thinner; irregular bleeding (this might have been due to my not always taking the medicine exactly at the same time each day).	Even taking the medicine correctly, my skin started breaking out again and I've had to go to a higher dose formula.
1726	advair-hfa	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	asthma/allergies	Overall, the benefits have been very good.  A rescue inhaler hasn't been used in more than a year, nor has there been a severe asthma attack.  During the period there may have been three incidences where it seemed like an attack was coming on (curing exertion and cold, damp weather) but simply a better environment and a couple of cups of coffee warded it off.  There are times of wheezy, heavy-chestedness, but these are minimal in comparison to prior to taking Advair.	Wallet shock.  Patient seems to overall fall asleep easier, but tends to have some problems getting a deep sleep, but this may or may not be related to the Advair.  Other than that, there do not seem to be any adverse side effects  -- casually or medically -- after about 1-1/2 years of taking the medication.	The patient developed asthma four years ago.  It was controlled on an 'attack' basis, generally with an OTC inhaler.  When most OTC inhalers were taken off the market prior to reformulation, and a severe asthma attack, a prescription inhaler was prescribed, but it was being used more often than should, and did not alleviate the problems.  After a thorough examination, the doctor prescribed Advair, as directed with two puffs/inhales daily, morning and evening (at least 8 hours apart).  The patient is examined/tested every three months prior to refilling prescription to ensure there are no side-effects or adverse reactions.
692	accutane	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	cystic acne	complete cessation of my acne....effects lasted for about 2 -3 years	very dry skin, bloody nose	took accutane orally aswell as applied certain creams to my face
317	ativan	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	I have had problems falling asleep for many years. I had tried various other medicines, both over the counter and prescription, and nothing seemed to work - some didn't work at all, some helped me initially fall asleep but woke me up in the middle of the night, and others made me tired and feeling as if I were drugged the next morning. Then one day, my dentist prescribed one Ativan to take before bedtime the night before an extraction, and I actually fell asleep standing up! This is the first sleep medication that helps me initially fall asleep, sleep through the night, and doesn't make me feel tired the next day. Plus, it has the added benefit of helping to reduce my worry, anxiety, and stress that had always kept me from falling asleep before.	"One of the warnings on the bottle is ""May cause drowsiness"". Well, that's why I am taking it! If you don't want to feel drowsy, then Ativan is probably not for you. Another drawback is that if it is used too often, your body will get used to it and you may have to bump up your dose. When I first began taking Ativan, I only needed half a mg. to fall asleep, so I would cut a tablet in half. I only use it 3 or 4 times a month, but even at that dosage, after having used it for several years, I now find I have to take a whole tablet in order for the Ativan to help me sleep."	After having this prescribed to me by my dentist, I knew it was very effective. I'd tried various other medications prescribed by my doctor to help me sleep, so I told him I'd like to try Ativans as they had worked so well as a relaxant before a dental extraction. We worked together to come up with a dosage, and he then prescribed the 1mg. As stated before, the one mg. was more than enough at first, so I would cut the tablets in half and for the first couple years this worked just fine. For the past couple years though, I've had to use the 1mg. before bedtime... and will probably have to talk with my doctor soon about going to a stronger dosage as I am noticing lately that it is not working as well as it once did.

This drug was added as a preventative medication when migraines became so dibilitating that I could not function in everyday life, i.e., go to work, take care of self and family, etc.  Migraines were reduced after approximately 6-8 weeks on the medication to about 1 per month and then continually reduced to 1 every 3 to 6 months as I stayed on the medication.  I also use the medication to manage my mood disorder (bi-polar disorder) and was able to not have to take a mood stabalizer, because this drug also manages to keep me from getting ""manic"", so it is an extra ""bonus"" on top of the migraine management!!"	The only side effect I noticed was some weight loss in the beginning.  My doctor was very careful to start me out on 50 MG and move me up VERY slowly to the 200 MG 2x per day, which I understand is a very high dosage and took all of 4 years to get to that dosage.  I was monitored every 30 days to ensure that I was not losing too much weight, having any type of eye problems, or numbness in my hands or feet--the eye problems, and numbness I never experienced; but was always told that if I did experience even a hint of these things, that I would have to stop the medication immediately--so my doctor does constantly ask me about those things.  I have also read that Topamax has been used to treat alcoholics, and have noticed that since taking it, I have no desire to drink alcohol at all--but I am not an alcoholic--just a unique observation.  It really just seems like a great drug!!	I am still taking it to manage both  my migraines and my mood disorder--200 MG 2x per day.  I take 2 in the AM and 2 in the PM.  It is prescribed by my Neurologist and managed by him mostly; and my psychatrist also works with him, because if I ever go off of the drug, I would be required to go onto a mood stabalizer due to the bi-polar disorder.  I would be very unhappy to have to go back onto something like Depakote, because that made me very slow and sluggish and Topamax does not have that side effect.
2688	prinivil	1	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	high blood pressure	blood pressure under control	Head itching, mouth and throat itchy swollen, cough, ringing in ears, bloating, extreme fatigue and depression.	"I have been off this medication for 2 weeks. No more itching/swelling, ringing. I still have some fatigue, but not constantly and hope that I will continue to improve.
While many people seem to take this drug without significant side effects, for some it is pure poison. Beware!"

1192	prozac	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	Within a week, I felt as if dark cloud of loneliness and unbearable sadness had drifted away.	I had some GI issues, some bloating and intestinal gas, but this went away after a few weeks.	Initially I was a participant in a blind study, which lasted about six weeks.  I suspected that I was not in the control group because of my dramatic results.  Following the study, we were each given a consultation with the physician who was overseeing the test.  He was the head of the Psychopharmacology Department at the University of Pennsylvania.  He explained to me how the drug worked and suggested that I stay on it for a while.  I remember he remarked how I walked the first few days of the test, and how different my demeanor became after the first week.  I stayed on the drug for close to two years, then weaned myself off.
3884	abilify	2	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	bipolar	None due to the short time taking drug.	Headache first morning at 4AM that was relieved with Excedrin.  Migraine headache with vomiting that lasted 14 hours.  Couldn't go to work that day and stopped taking it.	Not much to tell.  I was just starting treatment with Klonopin and Abilify with the goal of stopping Klonopin in 30 days and then seeing how Abilify was working.
177	olux	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	ezema on my hands	The treatment completely cleared up the rash on my hands, usually in just a few days. Since it was a foam I could apply it easily and there was no residue.	Upon the first few applications there was a slight burning sensation. This quickly went away.	I would squeeze a small amount of the foam onto my hands and then rub them together, working the medicine into my skin and leave it on.
50	clarinex	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	allergies	I have chronic allergies because I am allergic to dust rather than a seasonal allergen, like ragweed. I have tried many products, but typically they are so drying that I am forced to discontinue use. This product is effective at reducing the production of mucus and eye irritation from a sever allergy to dust. I haven;t used this	Generally, I find allergy medications, such as Claritin and Zyrtec to be too drying to be useful. I live in a dry city (Los Angeles) and I am prone to nose bleeds, dry eyes and dry skin. There is still some drying associated with this drug if I take it daily. However, if I take it occasionally, it is fine. I also can tolerate prolonged usage of this medication better than  I can other allergy medications.	The prescription says to take 1 tablet every day as needed for allergies. My allergist suggested I use this daily, as I have chronically dark circles under my eyes and a drippy nose, even though I have a home with zero carpet and have sealed my bed and pillows in allergen barriers. However, I do not take this daily because it is drying and costly to do so. I use this occasionally when I sleep at someone';s house or need to dust or sweep.
64	flexeril	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	neck pain	able to function at job and sleep with neck pain. Addressed tension and inflammation issues that allowed me to be able to use my arms freely and to also be able to lay on my neck at night to be able to sleep.	sleepy	used to eliviate neck pain to be able to function at work
1537	vagifem	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	vaginal dryness	After menopause, I experienced painful intercourse and some bleeding caused by vaginal dryness. I tried over-the-counter lubricants including suppositories but found them to be inconsistent and they also masked sensitivity in the vaginity area.	Vagifem has little side effects. I occasionally notice some discharge. I also feel bloated for a day or so after inserting.	The small tablet is inserted vaginally twice a week. It's recommended that you do so at the same time of day. Twice a week is somewhat difficult to keep track of. Does that mean every 3 days or every 4 days? It involves marking treatment down on a calendar to maintain a regular schedule.
2396	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	thyroid cancer	The treatment benefits of taking Synthroid have everything to do with metabolism regulation.  Because I had thyroid cancer the entire thyroid was removed.  Since thyroid hormone keeps the body running at optimum speed, it is now essential for me to take medication that will accomplish what my body is no longer capable of doing on its own.	There have been no treatment side effects for me thus far.	Treatment consists simply of taking a 100 mcg Synthroid pill each morning.  This should be taken on an empty stomach and no food should be taken for one full hour.  It is also important not to take any calcium supplement for four hours after taking Synthroid.  Calcium interferes with the body's ability to effectively utilize the Synthroid.
3468	ambien-cr	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	sleep	None.	I was found after taking the drug, 2 miles away from my home by the police department. I have no recollection of what happened. I do not know when I left the house & started walking, but we suspect around 6 am. I was totally incoherent, dilusional, confused & had no idea where I was at. I was in my night clothes & barefoot even.	Taken to ER & given 2 lites of Normal Saline IV. I then became rational. I was unable to even name the president!
3148	tylenol	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	toothache	the treatment eased pain very efficiently. I had no pain all day after just 3 pills. besides, I did not feel numb or anything, only the pain went away.	none obvious that I could feel, at least in the short term. not sure about long term side effects. but I'm not taking this drug for too long or dependent on it so guess it won't be a problem.	I had a toothache and went to the doctor who prescribed this drug to me. it was very effective and no side effect, at least not on me. after a day, my toothache went away.
2398	synthroid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	thyroid	I saw a large improvement in my skin which had become very dry and flaky on my legs and also on my face.  I have a blood test every year and after the initial experimenting with the dosage which started at .50 my thyroid levels are normal.	There are no side effects that I have noticed.	I was surprised when informed by my doctor that my thyroid level was low.  I didn't associate increased dry skin and perhaps slowing down a bit to thyroid levels.  Although, after talking about it I realized it ran in my family.  My mother and brother were also on thyroid medication.
2719	elavil	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	insomnia	Highly effective for sleeping.	Slept for 3 days. Very disoriented and groggy!	"not exactly what I had in mind. I wake up during the night at 2 or 3 or 4 am
and am unable to go back to sleep, I wanted the ability to sleep through the night. But I did not want to sleep for 3 days!
I think maybe the initial dose was too high. I only took one tablet and never took another one."
3497	maxalt	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine	Decreased headache pain from 10/10 to 0/10 within a few hours. Took at least 30 minutes to feel pain start to decrease, then causes fatigue. I like the fact that it disintegrates sublingually, because vomiting is often associated with my headaches and I am never sure how much medication is retained afterward if I have taken a tablet.	It always puts me to sleep for an hour or two. After waking, I sometimes feel a little shakey, but the pain is gone. I wouldn't take this med if I were out of the house due to the grogginess.	Treatment for migraine when otc's, or prescription level ibuprophen (800 mg) are not effective. Used for moderate migraine if it lasts a few days, or when pain reaches 8 to 10/10.
2481	enbrel	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	ankylosing spondylitis	total disappearance of psoriasis, greatly reduced fatigue, increased mobility, little-no sciatica, pain only felt upon application of pressure, all infection markers reduced	some swelling to soles of feet, some colds/coughs but no bad infections, cuts and bites take longer to heal, very severe injection site reactions leading to transfer from etanercept to adalimumab	x
399	relpax	7	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	It would ease the throbbing feeling associated with a migraine.	Low blood pressure.	You could feel a marked difference in your blood pressure, that was the only negative side effect. Other than that, it helped calm the pulsating sensation you would get with an intense migraine. Helping you to relax and feel better.
3330	tetracycline	1	Marginally Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	ulcer	cant say because I had to stop taking it after just 2 days due to severe after effects	excrutiaing stomach/intestinal pain	The drug was prescribed for treating H-pylori infection but it caused ore severe pain than hte ailment itself. It was too strong a drug for me and I had to be switced erothromycin and amoxcillin after only 2 days of tetracycline combo. It also made me dizzy.
2669	prinivil	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	high-normal hypertension	Lowered blood pressure	Extreme lethargy, coughing all day and during the night. Dry mouth and gagging at night. Nausea and the feeling of a weight on my chest. Sneezing, sore throat.  Because I have allergies, I thought they were just giving me more trouble than usual. Constipation/diarrhea. The feeling of being winded with only a moderate amount of activity. I am only 15 lbs. overweight and am used to a very active life but feel down and depressed a lot and have problems getting to sleep at night.	I had an average of 135 to 145 over 80 or 90 that is called high-normal.  But because I had a stroke in my eye, my doctor felt that I had had a spike in blood pressure that caused the problem. I was given Coreg which brought the numbers down a bit, but then my Dr. felt that lisinopril would help take it down lower along with the Coreg-which it did. But then, my allergies seem to get really horrible and my breathing got worse and worse until I mentioned all of my symptoms at my three month check up today. It wasn't my allergies, it was the medication. We stopped the lisinoprol.  I have never had such bad affects from a medication. I hope the new medication will be better, but you can bet I will check it out thoroughly before taking it.
2729	elavil	4	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	insomnia	The drug helped with sleep, but was inconsistent. I was a chronic insomniac, rarely sleeping more than 5 hours a night, often less.  With amitriptyline I was able to sleep more regularly (although not always), thereby alleviating some of the symptoms of depression and living more functionally on the whole.	Unfortunately, athough I was sleeping more regularly, I was still not rejuvenated.  The sleep was of a drugged quality, remarkably different from a natural sleep, in that I still felt tired a lot of the time.  Always dry mouth after the night, and after several years of use, I wondered if it had affected my memory, as loss of memory was notable. Seems to me that I had frequent headaches, as well.	I took the drug every night, just before I intended to sleep.  Often I would fall asleep, but still wake in the night, although usually falling asleep again, which I would not be able to do without the drug.  Mornings were a little foggy for me, and there was the reality of dry-mouth, and the possibility of a headache.  I tried to quit for several months after the second year, but was so plagued by insomnia that I went back on it.  After another 9 months or so, I quit because I was worried that the long term use had affected my memory and the efficacy of the drug was inconsistent in any case.
762	flonase	5	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	nasal congestion from allergies	Cleared up nasal passages pretty well.  Was about as effective as pseudophedrine, but longer lasting.	Acne	I was prescribed generic Flonase about 6 months ago for nasal congestion due to allergies. I've always had some sporadic adult acne flair ups from time to time, but it got much worse after I started using this nasal spray. I even started getting some pimples on my chest which I never had before.  I didn't know the Flonase was the cause until recently when I was looking up information on acne treatments online. I came across something that said steroids could cause acne, so I looked up the side effects of Flonase and sure enough acne was listed.  I stopped using Flonase a week and a half ago and the acne is completely gone!
2255	patanol	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	eye allergies	I have seasonal allergies and especially in the spring and fall, my eyes itch and get dry. These drops contain anti-histamines that are delivered directly into the eye, and therefore are more effective than just using anti-histamine pills. I think they also helped with the eczema-like flaking on my eyelids but I cannot be sure because I was also using anti-histamine pills at the time.	I did not experience any side effects.	These drops really helped with the symptoms but I did wish I could use it more often than just 2 times a day.
3543	vivelle-dot	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	menopausal symptoms	Fewer hot flashes & irritability.	Considerably sore breasts first 4-5 months of treatment.  I would encourage women with breast tenderness to hang in there.  It went away completely over time.  Once in a while I have a day or two of soreness, but very tolerable.	Started with 0.025 mg 2 X per week.  Then started having more hot flashes so am trying 0.0375 mg.  If cost is an issue, you CAN cut these patches.  So if you wanted 0.025 you could buy the 0.05 and cut it in half.

No smell or fragrance.	created such redness and irratation my face looked worse from that then it did from the acne. Created cracks around my eye area that was very sensitive.

i drank allot of water that migth explain why there were no side effects"	no side effects	"when i first started taking the medicin, i had very severe acne. the change in my condition was notisible after about 1.5 months and after 4 months i had mostley red marks who were left after the pimpels. 
today I still have some acne and once at a while a big pimple pops out, but i am satisfied because the proces was very easy and as i sed i had no side effects."
461	flagyl	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	crohn's abcess	To stop a absess behind my rectum caused by crohn's, flagyl did not help but they giving to me. I trusted the Doctor's.	I have permanent Peripheral Neuropathy!	I had numerous surgeries with the insertion of c-tongs to drain abcess, they just kept bagging the flagyl into me not telling me that I could get peripheral neuropathy.  Today 8 years later I take neurontin a very low dose, can't handle higher than 200mg per day for the peripheral neuropathy,  My Neurologist has tried everything under the sun, but I guess only God can repair or give you new nerves damaged forever by the medicine.  I also take percocet 5/325 4 times a day because it takes the edge off of the burning and feeling like I have a motor sitting on top off both feet.  I also walk w/ a cain my left leg sometimes does not come forward and I have fallen breaking wrists, ribs and such.
2962	zyban	4	Considerably Effective	Severe Side Effects	stop smoking	Not wanting a cigarette	"This is the second time 3 yrs apart Ive had this drug.The first time no problems apart from a dry mouth and stopped smoking for 18months.
This time as soon as I went onto two tablets a day severe mental problems,depression,shakes,insomnia,problems focusing,joint ache all pretty bad and all starting within a day of taking two tablets.I stopped straight away and the problems are slowly subsiding."	Id recommend being very wary when moving onto 300mg a day.At the first sign of problems stop taking them.That said the first time I had no problems at all.
2496	remeron	7	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	depression, insomnia, rx induced insomnia	"None, just started.
I rated a 7 due to the potential it has after one experience. Blue/green clouds are nothing to scoff at!"	"Hallucinations, waking up feeling as if in out to sea on a small sailboat and i am trying to walk below deck and its very rough waves outside. I was swaying pretty hard, then came the blue and green clouds, which i had to walk through, WHICH did not go away for hours, until i called in sick and took a nap. They should put a note on the Rx bottle ""will(not just may) cause hallucinations"". Although, i maintained, i do not know if i will try to stay on the medication - that was 2 nights ago."	"Lexapro 10mg in the morning.
7.5mg Remeron 1 hour before bed.
Lexapro is WAY too stimulating. I cant imagine it making me groggy really, it feels almost like cathinone stimulation. On the verge of euphoric, but not, and very jittery - so i was hoping the remeron would counteract that like the doc said. Another day on the weekend this time(blue and green keyboard made it really hard to work in the morning) ill attempt to start again, hopefully that was a strange occurrence(although, it was entertaining, but not ok for going to work!)."
4085	mobic	10	Highly Effective	Severe Side Effects	arthritis	I have arthritis in my spine and right foot.  Without the Meloxicam I'm in severe pain in my back, and my foot becomes so painful I can't put any weight on it.  So, walking becomes very difficult.  As long as I'm taking the medication, but regions do not cause me the severe pain I'm in without it.	Unfortunately, I wasn't always taking it with food, so not sure if that was the cause or I just developed side effects from the medication.  But, after being on it for a year and a half I developed severe stomach pains, and gas.  My stomach would swell as the day went on and became very hard and painful.  So I stopped taking the drug and those things went away, but my foot got so bad I couldn't walk, so now I'm trying it every other day, but still my stomach tends to become a bit upset.	My doctor prescribed Meloxicam (7.5) once a day, when it started to cause stomach pain he prescribe Previcaid to counter act the stomach pain, but that didn't really work very well.

1963	lyrica	5	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pain in my legs	relieved the pain	swelling, weight gain, fatigue	I was prescibed lyrica for pain in the leg.  It was caused by an impinged nerve in my back.  Since weight gain was a side effect of the medicine, although it did releive my pain, it made it harder for the swelling in my back to go down.  In the end, I came off lyrica and immediately dropped 20 pounds and the nerve was no longer impinged.
3481	diazepam	1	Ineffective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	anxiety	None	Drug-induced psychosis, resulting in 10 day commitment to a mental institution.	"Many people I know - I now work as a health care professional - erroneously believe that Valium, Xanax, Ativan, and other benzodiazepines must be used ""as directed"" and have enhanced benefit if ""built up in the brain""- ie: in ways similar to SSRI's effect on the brain over time.  I was entirely aware that diazepam is a ""prn"" medication, and chose to use the prescribed dosage on one particular day hoping it would carry me through a difficult situation. Unfortunately, I suffered a ""paradoxical reaction"" which cost me dearly in many tragic ways.  I was in a state of severe psychosis for days- because my ""benzo"" level was low when admitted to the hospital, I was given diazepam for an additional two days, whereupon I apparently refused to take any medication at all, and recovered as I ""detoxed"".  I have absolutely no memory of five days of my life.  I have done research into this phenomenon, and must warn all that this seems to occur most often in indiviguals with dopamine/GABA reuptake variants- such as those with ADHD, Parkinsons, and also PTSD.  Diazepam is a ""bandaid"" and offers no long-term therapeutic benefit whatsoever.  In fact, ""rebound"" anxiety and profound depression are common. What is most ironic is that in the medical setting, this occurs often after administration of ""Versed"", is recognized quickly, and fluzanimine is given as an antidote. Outside of this scenario, the patient is blamed, treated as a suspected drug addict, and stigmatized."
2115	renova	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	cystic acne on chin and jaw	Eliminated hormonal cysts; 3 years with no recurrence.	Dry lips.	Roaccutane was prescribed for late onset adult acne consisting of large cysts on the chin and jaw. Improvement was observed within 10 days. Liver function was monitored.

909	paxil	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety/depression	The decrease in aniety greatly increased the quality of life for the patient.	Some delayed sexual function, although not severe.  Some muscle jerks and twitches.	Two attempts were made to discontinue use, but both times the uncontrollable anxiety returned.  After the first attempt, the med was restarted and symptom relief was restored.  The patient has just increased the dosage back to 20 mg after having weened down to 5 mg and is hoping that symptoms will subside once again.  If efficacy returns the patient desires to remain on the med indefinitely.

I am not a coffee drinker, so Adderall was like my �morning coffee.�  It sometimes would give me a feeling of mild euphoria, which was nice.

I am not a coffee drinker, so Adderall was like my �morning coffee.�  It sometimes would give me a feeling of mild euphoria, which was nice. Certain tasks (like cleaning the house!) didn�t seem so difficult because I would not get distracted by other things. Also dry mouth.	I was put on the medication by my family doctor when I complained of my inability to finish projects. It was affecting every area of my life � work and relationships. Initially, I was prescribed Ritalin (but it gave me major tension headaches). I was then prescribed Adderall. It seemed to work right away with minimal side effects.

I have had no side effects from taking zirtek.	I take 1 10mg tablet every morning.
4021	celexa	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression	The Vermox killed off the effects of the parasitic illness which included extreme fatigue, chronic diarrhea, dehydration, and weight loss.  The Celexa was effective in elevating my mood which had been diagnosed as depression.  It was the doctor�s belief that the long term effects of the parasite presence in my body led to my decline in physical and mental health.  I continued on the generic form of Celexa, Citalopram for a total of three years.  I no longer take medication for depression and my health is quite good.	The side effect of the Vermox was primarily a metallic taste in my mouth which lasted throughout the treatment of twenty one days.  The Celexa  gave me a symptoms of dry mouth as well as some decrease in sexual desire.	I took a Vermox tablet orally for three weeks and another dose for three days a month later.  I began taking a dosage of Celexa of 40mg which was eventually reduced to 20mg per day after about 1 � years.  I continued a dosage of 20mg for another 1 � years, but switched to the generic form, Citalopram.
2881	avita	2	Ineffective	No Side Effects	anti ageing	Didn't really see any improvements but not sure if I am applying correct amount.	Some dry skin and flaking, which made make-up application difficult.  Tried to exfoliate to which gave some improvement. Also, skin sensitivity after the initial peel of skin.  Not sure if I will continue to use this product as I cannot see any improvement to fine lines.	Daily application caused some irritation, so started to use is twice as week.  Not sure if this is why I have seen little improvement.
4051	amoxil	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	chest infection	Prior to taking the Amoxicillin I was in a lot of discomfort including tightness in the chest, fever, painful cough and difficulty in breathing. This meant that I was not able to work and had to stay in bed. The effects of the Amoxicillin was almost immediate in that within two hours of taking the drug many of they symptoms had diminished considerably; in particular, breathing was no longer difficult or painful and the fever was reduced. Due to the rapid improvement of my condition following the first few doses of Amoxicillin I was able to return to work almost immediately.	There were no noticable side effects.  For the seven day period that I was taking the Amoxicillin caplets I did not feel 'normal' in that I felt light headed and somewhat disconnected.  However, I was still coughing with the chest infection and it was difficult to tell how much of what I was feeling was due to the infection and its after-effects and how much was due to the Amoxicillin.  My own perception was that the Amoxicillin had no noticable side-effects.	I was prescribed 21 Amoxicillin caplets which were 500mg per dose.  I was instructed to take the medicine at regularly spaced intervals and to complete the prescribed course.  I therefore took one caplet at breakfast at around 8am, one caplet after lunch at around 3pm and one caplet in the evening at around 10pm.  I was not advised to take the Amoxicillin caplets with food and, apart from the first daily dose, the times I took the caplets did not coincide with meals. I swallowed the caplets with water as advised.
1311	fexofenadine	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	chronic idiopathic urthicaria with pruritis	Incidents reduced from daily to maybe every 6 to 8 weeks.  If I missed my dose however by hour 14 I would start to break out.  This would indicate to me that the histamine levels are ever present and the histamine blocker is what is keeping their ill effects at bay.  I have however discovered that recently my pharmacy changed their generic manufacturer and the new version is very ineffective.  I've had 5+ severe breakouts in 3 months	Virtually none.  Not drowsiness, not upset stomach, no nothing.  Just don't miss your dose.	take one at 7 am when I wake up, the other at 7pm after supper.
2604	ortho-tri-cyclen-lo	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	pcos/ irregular periods	clearer skin, did not affect weight	moodier then usual	I've been taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo for about 8 years now. I'm (21) I began taking BC when I was 14 because I was having irregular periods and was diagnosed with possible PCOS ( Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome) Pros:The BC hasn't altered my appetite or weight...I have never suffered from severe acne but noticed that my skin appeared clearer while taking the pills... predictable periods...no cramps or bloating...Cons: the only negative side effect I noticed was that I was moodier then usual. Ortho Tri-Cyceln Lo has worked well for me...everyone is different so I can't say how it will work for everyone else. I hope this was helpful. My doctor recommended Yasmin but I'm scared to try it because of all of the negative reviews it has received!
4025	celexa	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	depression and anxiety	After a week of taking 20 mg a day, I went from suicidal to genuine happiness. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder and my symptoms have already gotten 90% better. My level of stress is very, very low and my depression is pretty much gone. I can go back to doing things I love and I have more energy to go about my day. Only thing is that I also have insomnia and although it has calmed my nightly discomfort, it has not helped me sleep. But I'm waiting for it to help since my doctor said it would take time. I would recommend this drug to anyone!	I started taking it in the morning, but it made me a little drowsy, so I began taking it at night. Makes me more tired, but hasn't helped me overcome my insomnia just yet.	I first began seeing a psychologist who rushed my psychiatric visit. I was originally put on Prozac prescribed from an emergency room to hold me over until I saw my psychiatrist, but it threw my body out of whack and I was having very bothersome side effects. My doctor switched me to Citalopram, the generic for Celexa, and so far it has done wonders for me. I am only taking 20 mg a day and already I feel wonderful, and only after 9 doses. I may not even need to be put on a higher dosage, I feel so great.
383	corgard	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	Eliminated the irregular heart beat as well as the occasional heart racing in addition to controlling the blood pressure.  Initially started taking while on birth control and having stress sytems of a racing heart beat.	Initially tired more than normal but tiredness subsided in a few days	take daily in the morning
1121	effexor	1	Moderately Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	gad	This drug did work at alleviating the anxiety for which it was prescribed.	My God, I'm amazed that this drug is still on the market. I'm actually an MD, and was prescribed this drug for anxiety and panic attacks. I know to give a drug about a month to work, but I lasted all of 3 days on this!! Started with a 75 mg dose, immediately fell asleep for 4 hours, woke up feeling so out of it that I could barely string a sentence together, spent the next day feeling nauseous, hot, sweaty, jittery and weak. Got leg spasms that night and woke up 12 hours post-ingestion having a rebound panic attack. When morning finally arrived, I had the kind of hangover headache that you get when you're in college and have spent the night parting and binge drinking, but without any of the fun. The next day, upon advice from my psychiatrist, I dropped the dose right down to 25 mg, with no change in side effects. 3rd day I tried only 6.25 mg (quarter of a 25 mg pill), and still felt nauseous, hot, dizzy and weak...and fell asleep for two hours. This is now day 6 and I'm finally recovering from my 3 day trip to hell with Effexor. Left a 5 min message on my psychiatrist's machine - will not be taking this crap anymore!! Will not EVER be prescribing this to any of my patients.	75 mg per day starting dose for anxiety and panic attacks.
2127	renova	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	aging skin	I had less wrinkles, better tone and texture overall. People could not discern my age and wrinkles developed when I stopped using. I developed no acne during the use of Renova.	I developed severe hyperpigmentation and somewhat dry skin. My skin is also thinner and transparent around the eyes.	After 5 years of daily use, I developed melasma on forehead after a single day of sun exposure. I sought treatment and used high amounts of prescription hydroquinine but the melasma is still apparent. I have been told I need light therapy to remove.
567	atenolol	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	high blood pressure	This medication, in combination with a diuretic, worked to lower my high blood pressure.	I had no side effects.  I especially liked this drug, because previously, I had been taking a beta-blocker, which lowered my heart rate and made cardiovascular exercise using heart rate training impossible.	Took in combination with diuretic, hydrochlorothyzide
2510	motrin	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	headake	I have quite ofren this problem, but the headacke goes away in a few minutes and the medicament works well for other pains too.	I have had stomac acidity if I did not have had a meal before, followed with a nausea, but with full stomac I did not have any side effects.	Only one tablet was enough every time I have had headake
2658	diclofenac	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	slipped disc in back	I went to the doctor with a badly herniated disc in my lower back.  It was very inflamed and I had trouble standing completely up right.  The doctor prescribed me hydrocodone for the pain and the diclofenac for the inflammation.  The diclofenac worked really quickly at getting the inflammation down without really any side effects.	I really did not experience any side effects. I did notice however that when I took it on an empty stomach, I would get a little bit nausiated. I took it for two weeks straight and never experienced any bad side effects other than feeling a little sick to my stomach if I did not eat anything before I took it.	I was prescribed diclofenac for a badly herniated disc in my lower back.  When I went in to the doctors office I could barely walk.  He prescribed me diclofenac to be taken 50mg a dose two to three times a day for inflammation.  I took it for about 2 weeks.  I noticed a difference in the inflammation with the first dose.  It worked great for me.
2942	mirapex	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	pain in legs (diagnosis restless leg syndrome)	I had been to several doctors regarding pain in my thigh mostly.  I had seen Orthopedic Dr, Family practice (2), Endocrinologist and finally Nuerologist, who prescribed the Mirapex.  I did note slight improvement in leg pain however the weight gain issue was totally unacceptable to me and the benefit was only slight.  I have had much better results with Lyrica.	Basically, I only noticed a huge weight gain of approximately 15 pounds.  I do not really recall any further side effects.  There were however, other side effects listed on the prescription contraindication form.  I do not recall what the side effects listed on that form were now.	he Doctor told me to take  he medication at bed time each evening. she also suggested that I might find it useful to sleep with a contour pillow between my thighs.  She said to get up and walk around rather than lie in bed tossing if I could not sleep.  As for the weight gain, it was recommended that I try to excercise more and reduce caloric intake.
724	claripel-cream	5	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	age spots	Some of the larger brown spots faded. Skin seemed smoother.	Caused irritation and more redness. Skin was very sensitive. Some dryness. Most suncreens caused burning and itching.	Told to use in morning and night all over face.  This proved to be too much for my skin so I tried just at bedtime.  Need to wait after washing face for skin to dry and settle. Was also suggested to try different face cream moisturiser and sunscreen during the day.  Sunscreen a must.  Also used some anti-wrinkle cream with retinoid...
1154	byetta	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	diabetes	Lowered blood sugar on a daily basis, lowered A1C ratings and led to a much better overall feeling of control for the diabetes.  Allowed for a more varied diet while keeping blood sugar controlled.  Insulin resistance seems to be in better control.  Lowered appetite which led to weight loss.	A little nausea when I first started taking the drub.	A patient is instructed to start out using the 5 mg pen for one month, then if doing well, progressing to the 10 mg pen.  Then the patient is monitored every 3-6 months to determine how well drug is controlling blood glucose which is done by taking the A1C test.
1653	clomid	1	Ineffective	Severe Side Effects	unexplained infertility	Intended to produce more follicles to increase chances of conception, in combination with intrauterine insemination.  I had 5 rounds of treatment, though I'm not sure why the doctor chose to try this many times when none of the early tries were successful.  Some stimulation occurred - 7-10 follicles were stimulated with each treatment - but conception did not occur.	Visual disturbances (flashing light effects, blurring), mood swings, fluid retention.	Clomid was given on days 3-7 of the menstrual cycle, one 50 mg pill by mouth per day, at the same time each day.  Follicle progress was subsequently tracked via ultrasound.  Side effects were minimal with the first round of treatment, more severe with the 2nd onward.  I have no known allergies or sensitivities to other medications, other than topical iodine.
2392	synthroid	8	Moderately Effective	No Side Effects	hypothyroid	better mental acumen, energy,hair texture,better physical endurance and strength	I would not term the effects as negative side effects, nor would I say they the effects were as beneficial as I expected them to be. 10 years later and I am still suffering the same symptoms, though not as severe. I have had a very difficult time getting traditional Dr.s to look beyond the Thyroid and to realize that for a woman it becomes a package deal. Once you hit menopause and the chemical balance shifts it is not enough to look at one part of the body and blame that for all your symptoms. I was NEVER sick as a child or young adult. I never had female problems, but once menopause set in my body went haywire. I KNOW, in speaking with women my own age,that I am not an isolated case. Thyroid disease is more prevalent than ever and this drug does not cut it for some patients.	One pill every morning 1 hour before breakfast. Just recently instructions have included not taking vitamins with Calcium 2 hrs after the pill, but this has not made a difference.
1336	seroquel-xr	9	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	bipolar disorder 2	Works for both depressive and hypomanic episodes. Makes me calm, slows down my thoughts, and enables me to concentrate properly and work again. Sleeping very well. Feel like a normal human being again!	Groggy early in the morning but an espresso and a bit of exercise wakes me up completely. (Wish someone had told me to exercise early in the morning before!) Also learnt to take pills earlier at night (6pm) for better sleep and less grogginess in the morning. Initially picked up 30 lbs but now losing weight through exercise and watching intake. Seroquel makes me hungry but I choose what to put in my mouth. When I am manic or depressed, I eat anything, but on Seroquel I can at least choose what and when to eat. I have suffered from migraines (with aura) for decades, but these have stopped too! The longer I have been on Seroquel, the less the side effects became.	Started on 25 mg and stopped after a few months. Restarted at 150 mg, then 200 mg and now 300 mg.
1017	estrace	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	surgical menopause	hot flashes  I still have the night sweats.	gallbladder disease, high cholesterol, (higher with the new Estrace). reflux	"I have tried all products available, but this product worked the best.However,once this product changed manufacturers, this product stopped giving the great benefits it once did.  The name brand product does not work any better than the generic.
It only works about 1/2 as well the original Estrace.  From my research on the web, I am not the only person with this problem.   I really miss my old Estrace!  I am sending this product and the generic product to an independent lab and have the ingredients analyzed.  The generic and the name brand are manufactured by the same company.  My money is on them being identical products!!! I sincerely believe this company is selling their generic form of Estrace as their name brand.  The are cashing in all over the market."
2064	capoten	1	Marginally Effective	Severe Side Effects	high blood pressure	Lower blood pressure	I developed an intractable cough, and a post nasal drip.  Cough worsened daily to the point that I was unable to speak any full sentence without either a coug,h or tears coming to my eyes in an effort to not cough.	Capoten was to be taken 150 mg daily - in divided doses.  Propanolol was 20 mg twice a day, and the Hydrochlorothiazide was to be 12.5 mg daily. Blood pressure baseline was 180's over 110.  Resultant decrease was to 150s over 105.  Stopping the Capoten relieved the cough after about 3 weeks of being off the medication.
3895	dispermox	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	ear infection	To clear the ear infection she was having and the mild cough and other cold systom she was suffering from at the time. The drug is a penicilin-type antibiotic used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections.	Nausea vomiting or diarrhea may occur. the medicine may cause temporary staining of the teeth, serious side effects such as dark urine,persistent nausea or vomiting,stomach pain or cramping or blood or mucus in your stool.  Prolong use oral thrush or a new viginal yeast infextion.  White patch in your mouth a change in vaginal discharge or other new systoms.  My child itch all over	I can't remember quite well but it was to take it after each meal 3 times a day.

Lost a lot of weight.	tingling fingers temporarily, fatigue, increased hair loss, weight loss.  Blood pressure dropped very low during weight loss phase.	take one in morning and one before bed.  I have a mixture of migraine and tension headache.  The tension headaches all but disappeared.  Migraines came only 3 days before period after begining topamax.
3928	nexium	7	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	Nexium does help in controlling reflux, but I haven't gone without it in so long that I don't know how my reflux would do on its own.  It isn't a complete fix.  I can't blame the drug for this, but it doesn't help at all if I drink caffeine.	No known side effect	I take it once daily on an empty stomach.  I sometimes take an additional dose at night if I'm having problems, but that doesn't seem to do my any good.
1327	prevacid	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	reflux	Completely eliminated my heartburn and reflux, which were a daily occurence and were not treated effectively with OTC medications like Pepcid.	None	Taking the drug on a daily basis got rid of my heartburn.  I recently had a scope of my upper GI and there were no problems.  I think Prevacid keeps me from having any damage to my esophagus.
263	ultram	3	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	sciatica and back pain	Mild to moderate relief of back pain	Addiction to the medicine. I could not stop taking it without experiencing physical withdrawal. [Sweating, night sweats, jumping out of skin, jittery nerves, lethargy, fatigue, depression.] I took it over a year just because I could not NOT take it. Finally, I quit cold turkey, suffered the withdrawal for about two days. Took over 8 months until the nerve jumps in my skin stopped at night.	I wanted a non-addictive drug since I am a recovering alcoholic so my doctor thought this was the ticket. The withdrawal was not worth the pain it initially alleviated. I would not have taken it had I known this would happen. I would have simply dealt with the back pain by altering my routine and lifestyle instead.
3694	effexor-xr	8	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	anxiety	After taking effexor XR, a consideralbe change in attitude and general outlook was improved. Increased desire to do daily activities improved as well as anxiety about social situations descreased somewhat.	There were really no side effects other than when one dose was missed, I became very dizzy.	I was placed on Paxil at first which did work, however I had lots of acne as a result.  After being placed on Effexor, I noticed an immediate change, however because I have been on this dose for a long time, I feel that the effects are wearing off.  I have not yet discussed this with my doctor.
1968	lyrica	9	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	fibromyalgia	Benefits where good with the Lyrica, I wish it controlled pain and inflamation more.  However I could not go back to living without it, I would be a mess.	No side effects related to the Lyrica medication.

71	flexeril	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	tension headaches, upper/lower back pain, neck pai	To relax the muscles	major headaches 20-30 mins after taking it.	After i take the medication in 20-30 mins i get alot if headaches, from the neck all the way up to the front of my head. But after the drug really sets in the pain goes away. i hope this changes and just relaxes the body without the headaches, i have to take it for two week and i'm on my seccond day.
1765	topamax	4	Moderately Effective	Severe Side Effects	borderline personality disorder	Some weight loss/craving control, lessened desire to drink	Tons of tingling in the hands/feet, intense hypersomnia (sleeping 16+ hours a day), increased aggressiveness, loss of appetite, lack of energy	Topiramate was given as a mood stabilizer for bipolar and BPD, ended up sleeping a great deal of the time, which I suppose stabilizes your moods if you're never awake to have them.

Itchiness at injection site.	Auto injection into alternating thigh every 7 days.
2921	tramadol	10	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	nightly leg pain	Completely stops nightly leg pain	No side effects at all	After trying everything from muscle relaxers to strong narcotic pain meds which did nothing to help my nightly leg pain, I was given Tramadol. I was to take 2 50mg tablets at bed time. I went home that day from the doctor thinking this was yet another medicine that would not work. To my surprise it worked! It has been the only treatment that works for my leg pain. I have taken it nightly for 2 years now. It has no side effects for me at all. I have not shown any signs of being addicted to the drug. I do not need more than the original dosage to work. I feel perfectly normal when taking it and can function normally. It doesn't help with other pain though and that is puzzling to me. But at least it works for my leg pain so I can sleep like a normal person at night.
169	zomig	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraine	Complete relief of headache - the only drug to take pain away.

A greatly lowered libido and extremely vivid dreams.	I was prescribed the drug at 20 mg a day.  For the first three weeks I took it in the morning but, due to severe drowsiness, after 20 days I began to administer it just before bedtime.

I took the 100mg tab around 9am with other meds per instructions, but the medication only lasted around 4 hours at the most, then I began to feel that wiped out feeling once again. I spoke with my gp & it was determined, that since my fatigue is so severe, we would move up immediately. Take 2 100mg tablets at 9a.m. then 1 100mg tablet at noon, should I be slowing down, with the engraved fatigue, I will change and rather than take 1 100mg tab at noon, I will take 2 200mg tabs at 1pm. Then by 4pm if needed take 1 100mg tablet. Will monitor closely, and go in monthly for Blood work, as this medication, can cause problems with the Liver.	N/A currently	Awaiting to see what is going to happen, I am VERY hopeful !!!! Good Luck to EVERYONE here, and God Bless, to each of you, and to me too :)

I take it once a day, and it virtually eliminates all of my asthma symptoms.  I hardly ever have to use my albuterol inhaler anymore.  I would recommend this to anyone who suffers from asthma.

I was plagued with upset stomach, constipation followed by diahrea, loss of balance, and the inability to remember words.

I was prescribed 75 mf of Lyrica to be taken twice daily for seven days with and increase to 150 twice daily to follow.  Due to the side-effects I was experiencing my doctor discontinued this medication on the seventh day of treatment.
159	zomig	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	migraines	I get occasional migraine headaches. Zomig is very effective in minmizing or eliminating the symptoms, which include severe headache, nausea, photosensitivity. I also get frequent exercise induced headaches, which do not respond to other OTC analgesics such as tylenol or motrin. Zomig is also very effective in minimizing or eliminating the headache pain.	Very mild feeling of flushing, or something like being light headed,	As soon as I determine this is a migraine, (severe headache with nausea) I take a zomig, and in between 45 minutes and 60 minutes, I start to feel a little light headed, and nausea and headache pain withdraw. For exercise headaches, the same pattern applies. As soon as I determine this is an exercise induced headache, I take a zomig, and within 60 minutes the pain has subsided.

At night, applied pea size amount of cream after cleansing face. Significant peeling around the mouth and nose, so avoided these areas except 1x per week. Peeling would subside after skipping 1 to 2 days of treatment, so initially used 3x per week until skin became adapted to it. To minimize peeling, daily mild exfoliation of the skin really helped. While my hyperpigmentation is not completely gone, I am pleased with the tone of my skin and the minimized wrinkles.
953	diovan	7	Highly Effective	Moderate Side Effects	high blood pressure	Reduced blood pressure.  If I was consistent with my dosage, after time if I missed a dose it wouldn't matter.  If I was inconsistent and forgetful with my dosage, I could feel heart palpitations and my bp would rise.  Bringing my weight down also helped greatly.  Typically my bp w/o dosing is 140/90.  At one time, I got it down to 118/80.  Consistency is a key in remembering to take the tablet faithfully every day and at the same time daily.	Initially I didn't notice any side effects.  After time, sometimes forgetting to take it, not getting RX refilled in time, chaning RX's, going back to Diovan, etc., my side effects became more noticeable and I had more of them.  Moderate to sever muscle aches were my major side effect.  Noticed more concentration required during driving, and eye vision blurriness.	At first took 80 mg dose, did well for several years.  Over time, weight crept up, wasn't managing stress well and dosage was upped to 160 mg.  Noticed more side effects on that dosage than on the 80 mg dose.  Also caffeine seems to play a major role for me in rising bp, as well as salt causing water retention.

Taking these two meds together changed my whole personality.It is clear that I cannot take these two together.  I will stay on the Gabapentin but will only take Hydrocodone when I am in extreme pain! It seems to help others when taking Hydrocodone and Gabapentin together but I will NEVER do this again.Gabapentin makes me sleep well. I used to get up 2 or 3 times per night but with this med I sleep all night and it has helped my depression a great deal.The only side effect I have noticed from Gabapentin was a little dizziness when I first begin taking it. It has since went away.	Gabapentin 600 mg at bedtime. Hydrocodone 7.5 mg every 4 hours or as needed.Valium as needed for sleep.
104	celebrex	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	ostoarthritis, severe body and joint pains	Very effective at eliminating pain	None yet that I have noticed.	"I have had severe pain in my joints, of the knee, back wrist and fingers, for about 10 years. I've had problems finding something to handle the pain aspirn and other such pills had little or no effect on the pain. I took vioxx until it was taken off the market, then tried a few others prescribed by my Doctor, none of those worked until celebrex. I'm sure there are side effects maybe long term however up to this point I haven't had any short term effects I'm aware of. If I don't take my pill in the morning I can always tell by afternoon and know I forgot to take it, the aches and pain becomes terrible.

1107	effexor	7	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression, rumination, anxiety	I was initially calmer and motivated on 35 mg.  I cleaned house and felt like I was moving in a positive direction.  I was very hopeful that I may be feeling better.  My internal chatter had quieted.	On 35 mg had an effect the first day. I didn't sleep but I did not expereince sleeplessness until the third night.  Impotence settled in.The first day with 75 mg a late afternoon anxiety dive,fatigue, depressive episod appeared.	One week 35mg, second week will be 75 mg, third week 150.mg.
2463	etodolac	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	osteo-arthritis	It is moderately effective in reducing the pain, and very effective in reducing the inflammation, swelling and heat in the joints.  I had not realized just how effective it is, until I ran out recently, and was without it for a few days.  I guess I had forgotten how debilitating OA can be.  Without it, I walk with a cane- with it, I don't need a cane, and can even walk for a mile or so for exercize, without 'paying for it' the next day.	At first it made me pretty drowsy.  After about three weeks, my body adjusted to it, and the drowsiness went away.  I have to be sure to take Etodolac after eating a meal, or it causes rather pronounced nausea.  I've found that it has to be an actual meal, too.  Just a nibble of something isn't enough to prevent the upset stomach.	I am severely allergic to Aspirin and Naproxyn, so cannot take these for the pain and inflammation of osteoarthritis.  I developed OA in both knees after injuring the cartilage and the arthroscopic surgery to try to repair the damage.  My left knee still has a little cartilage, but the right knee has bone on bone.  I had been taking Vioxx, which worked very well, but then it was pulled off the market.  Mobic did not work very well, so we went on to Etodolac.  Once a year, I have to go in and get bloodwork done, to make sure I have not developed any liver damage.

Having tried other drugs to quit smoking, I was shocked by how effective this drug was.	Severe depression, suicidal, that continued for eight months until I decided to start smoking again.

Dryness of the skin and mouth, peeling/flaking.  Seemed like my acne was getting worse, but I was told, my skin was purging the acne out, and that is exactly what it did!	"I went once a month to see my dermatologist, which he would look at and then prescribe me another refill of 30 pills, one to be taken everyday.  I had no insurance, so at the time I was using Accutane, it was $90.00, for a 30 day supply.  

I had to go once a month for a blood test, to make sure all organs were working properly. I had to go to the hospital, because the dermatologist I used at the time, did not have lab testing equipment, that could be done at his office. 

The only other thing I used and that was advised to me was to use a mild moisturizer, and the was Oil of Olay, they now call it Olay, and to use Dove soap.  I drank like a gallon of water a day, because I got cotton mouth, but that came and went, and was never constant. (I was never told to use sunscreen!)

After, about the end of the 2nd month of using Accutane, my face was just about free of any acne.  By the third month, my acne was just about gone.  The rest of the following months, I was free of acne.  The following months my face stayed dry all the time, and I just used Olay, in the morning and in the evening. By the end of the 8 months, I was taken off Accutane, and have never had acne since.

And the fine lines around my eyes were reduced dramatically.	I would get some peeling or redness if I applied too much.  If this occurred, I would stop using it for a day or two, and the problem would go away.  It was more of a concern in the winter months when my skin was more dry.  But having oily skin, it usually wasn't a big problem.	I was told to use it at night.  If redness or peeling occurred, use it less frequently.
361	neurontin	7	Moderately Effective	Mild Side Effects	peripheral pain arms	Reduced pain and discomfort in both arms.  Calmer and less anxious personality.

1474	cymbalta	5	Marginally Effective	Mild Side Effects	fibromyalgia	It seemed to relax me, which reduced some of the muscle pain that I had been having.  It seemed to slightly reduce the nerve pain, but not enough to warrant taking it long-term.  Other than that, I did not notice benefits specific to my fibromyalgia symptoms.  It did seem to neutralize my feelings however.  I could not experience deep sadness.  So, I can see how it would help with people suffering from depression.	I experienced drowsiness in the first 1-2 weeks which went away.  At night, I experienced dry mouth and dry eyes, usually beginning about 8pm through bedtime.  I am a bit more drowsy in the morning.  It takes a bit longer to wake up completely in the morning.	I took 20 mg. 1x per day (in the morning) for the first week, gradually working up to 60mg. 1x per day.  After 2 months, I am tapering down again.  60mg made me too drowsy.
783	naproxen	1	Ineffective	Moderate Side Effects	costochondritis/ inflammation of the chest wall	none	Nausea, loss of appetite, a little chest pain and vomiting. They gave me a shot of this at the hospital and then perscribed me with it. Once I got home I noticed I had an upset stomach, I thought it was because they gave me the shot on an empty stomach, so I ate something small and tried to take a nap. When I woke up from my nap my upset stomach did not go away and I felt naushes. I tried to drink a Powerade and eat a few preztles, that did not help at all. So for dinner I ate some soup and the upset stomach, nausea and chest pain still continued. I went to bed and woke up with stomach pains and still nausea. I ended up vomiting but only a little. I haven't taken any of the prescribed pills, just the shot at the hospital, and I am still feeling nausea, an upset stomach and a little chest pain. This medicine is not good at all.	I couldn't lift anything heavy cause of the inflammation in my chest or breathe in really cold air. The doctor told me instead of using Naproxen I can take a hot shower, use a heating pad or to take Ibuprofen to alevate the pain I was feeling when the inflammation would come back or get worse.
2986	strattera	3	Marginally Effective	Moderate Side Effects	add	"Strattera seemed to give me some energy and focus for a few hours.  However, about 5-6 hours after taking the pill, I get sleepy and groggy.  I have never taken a stimulant (newly diagnosed ADD), but this sounds familiar to the ""crash"" I hear people talking about.  So far the sleepiness and fatigue are out-weighing the benefits of this drug for me."	"See above.  Sleepiness and groggy-ness about 6 hours after dose.  I also feel irritable during the ""sleepy"" time, probably due to the fatigue factor.  I have noticed that little things get me irritated more easily while on Stattera."	"I am nervous about taking a stimulant, but this Strattera doesn't seem to be doing the trick for my ADD.  I also have no use for a med that makes me feel sleepy during the day...that is worse than the original ADD!!

Also, I have not noticed any appetite reduction, but it has raised my blood pressure.  I hear stimulants do that too, so I'm growing tired of messing with Strattera when I am getting stimulant side-effects with none of the stimulant benefits."
894	paxil	6	Moderately Effective	Moderate Side Effects	depression	The treatment Benefits included feeling less anxiety, stress and pressure in many social situations. I felt less irritable and more willing and open for change. I had been feeling very down on myself and �lost� in terms of my emotional well being and stability. I had been feeling a lot of pressure and like I didn�t fit in in many situations. I also felt that many things in life were hard- even small things like showering or brushing my teeth. Taking this medication helped me to overcome those feelings and be able to do everyday things without seeing them as such a challenge. It stabilized my mood as well so I wasn�t experiencing major irritability, intense frustration or anger.	The Side effects I experienced from this drug were minimal. I did experience some headaches and a bit of a �spacey� feeling in the head when I first started taking it. Overall, I would say that the major issue I experienced which I am considering a side effect was a dulling of the emotions. While it helped me to curb my frustration and irritability, it also dulled my ability to feel great happiness or excitement about anything. My husband complained that I just stopped caring about everything. I also became completely disinterested in sex.	I am unsure of what the treatment details mean. I took this drug for about a year under the supervision of my general practioner. I took a 10 mg dosage the entire time. This dose was never increased. The drug took about 4 weeks before I noticed the benefits. I stopped taking the drug when I, along with my GP felt that I was doing better and no longer needed it.
3579	differin	6	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	acne	reduced acne and refined skin texture. Helped to prevent new breakouts to a certain extent.	Dry skin. After washing even with the mildest cleansers I noticed my skin would be very tight and uncomforable.	"Differin is a retinoid, supposedly the mildest of all retinoids. I was prescribed this for mild, yet persistent acne. While it did help clear up the acne it also caused me to continue to get more pimples in areas I didnt normally get them. So it was a slight paradox. 

I would have continued to use the medication of it wasnt for the dryness and tighness I used to get after water touched my skin. My skin never felt comfortable. I gave it a good 5 months but my skin never seemed to adjust.

So while it worked pretty good for the acne, it also caused to much skin dryness. So I moved onto a new treatment method."
800	ambien	9	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	insomnia	For the treatment of insomnia, this drug induced sleepiness immediately after ingestion which was a tempory and necessary goal of the drug.	minimal side effects included mild grogginess upon waking.

I started taking the Biaxin as pary of Prevpac.  In about 3 days, I noticed that the pain was lessening and I was feeling less run down.

The infection was clearing up	After  taking the Biaxin for 9 days and feeling much improvement, I started noticing some itchy bumps on my legs.  Over the next 2 days, my whole body erupted into welts, especially in the axilla, the groin. I called my doctoe and stopped the Biaxin. I continued to have new hives each day for the next 5 days.  Gradually they went away.	To eliminate the side effects of hives, I had to stop the Biaxin and all other medication.  I ties taking Sudaphed to control the itching, but this was not effective.  I ended up going to the emergency room because the welst were so itchy and painful and I had not slept in 2 days.  They were unable to give me any medication for the reaction beacuse of my gastrointestinal distress.  I had to jus wait it out.
3916	nexium	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux / barrett's esophagus	Pain and heartburn from extreme acid reflux is well controlled, hypersensitivity to certain food is suppressed and Barrett's Esophagus has not progressed.	None that I am aware of.	I take Nexium once a day in the morning. If I have a flare up of acid reflux, I will take another at dinner time. The once a day regime generally controls my acid reflux quite well. On the rare occasions when I forget to take Nexium, reflux flares up immediately, so I have good evidence it is responsible for the symptom control.
3927	nexium	8	Considerably Effective	No Side Effects	acid reflux	Reduced the acid reflux and heartburn that was present in the late evening hours. Overall, Nexium relieved me of acid reflux and heartburn.	I did not experience side effects, although some people do.	I took a pill everyday (with water) about a hour before my dinner. I did not skip any days, but used everyday, so as to prevent heartburn rather than treat it.
1263	provigil	8	Considerably Effective	Mild Side Effects	multiple sclerosis	Provigil energizes me which improves my ability to function. Without it, the fatigue I experience due to MS overwhelms me and renders me pretty much useless.	The only side effect is increased wakefulness at night when I'd like to go to  sleep.	The neurologist who first diagnosed the MS prescribed Provigil in 2001. At first I took only 100 milligrams per day, but have gradually increased the dose in order to get the same effect I got initially. I've asked my doctors several times if the drug is addictive, and they say it is not supposed to be.
521	requip	9	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	restless legs syndrome	Requip has helped me sleep at night! no more horrible creepy crawley sensations... great medication!	None.	Take 1 pill 2 hours before bedtime.
892	paxil	10	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	mild depression	I could see a dramatic difference in my mood within 3 weeks!  I felt interested in all my hobbies again plus I was smiling and laughing more.  My doctor told me I could be the poster child for Paxil.  This drug made a remarkable improvement in my mild depressive state.  I recently (5 wks ago) underwent gastric bypass surgery.  The doctor that performed this surgery told me not to quit taking Paxil...it would be like losing my best friend.  I have had absolutely no depression after my surgery (which I understand is not common).  This drug is amazing!	The only side effects I had were temporary decreased sexual desire and a decreased ability to have orgasms.  These side effects went away after about 6 months on this drug.	I take one 20 mg. pill once a day at the same time.  I usually take my pill first thing in the morning because it's easier for me to remember.  I did research on this product before I actually started taking it and found that the 20 mg. dose had the same results as the 40 mg. dose and showed no marked improvement.  The 20 mg. dose has been great for me.
3618	retin-a	9	Highly Effective	Mild Side Effects	acne	Smoother skin with no pimples present. Lessening of fine lines. More even and radiant skin tone	Slight peeling and redness when treatment began	I began taking Retin-A because my skin was having breakouts at a very frequent rate. I began by washing my face with a mild ceanser. I alternated between Dove senstive skin and Cetaphil. The face must be washed gently with NO manipulation, scrubbing or washcloth!! After this I rinse with warm water to make sure all soap residue is gone. I then LIGHTLY pat my face dry with the softest towel I can find. Let the face AIR DRY for 15 minutes, then a PEA size amount of Retin-A can be applied to the face. This little amount is for the WHOLE face. Once the whole face is covered with the Retin-A , let it sink in for 5 minutes, then apply a moisturizer. I like to use Cetaphil cream for this or Moisturel. Remember that Retin-A should ONLY be used at NIGHT!! You must wear an SPF 30 sunscreen during the day as it makes the skin sensitive.
1657	clomid	8	Considerably Effective	Moderate Side Effects	infertility	Increased my estrogen levels, started ovulating again, and after about 6 months my ovulation formed a predictable pattern with an ending menstrual period. It was an easy small sized capsule to swallow and did not break down in water. Once ovulation was kicked off and preganancy still did not occur, it allowed my obstetrician to focus on other possible problems.	"Initially there were no problems, but after a week or so, began to suffer from blurred vision, which would appear and disappear at random. Hot flushes would also be sporadic. I also had a sense of ""scatterbrain"" ie my mind felt jumbled up, I could not make quick decisions, everything seemed blurry in my head. My stomach suffered from bloating  and a sense of squirmishness.  On some days I vomitted.Over time this decreased, and eventually after 1 and 1/2 years these symptons stopped. The time line probably could be reduced, but on ocassions of sickness, I stopped taking clomid and began the next month. My skin had a positive impact - it was very clear and had a very soft feel/texture. I had a very heightened sense of smell as well."	After a first successful pregnancy, my attempts at a second were not succeeding. Medical tests showed my ovulation hormones were very low and my period was very erratic and sometimes non existant. This coincides with my history of polycistic ovariaries. A dosage of Clomid was initiated with the aim of increasing hormones to correct levels, produsing measurable ovulation and resulting regular menstrual periods. Clomid caused some quite uncomfortable side effects initially ie dizziness, vomitting, unclear mental thoughts and stomach sensitivity, which onoccassons sent me to bed for recovery. Over time as my body absorbed clomid and adjusted to the hew level of hormones, the side effects stopped. Whilst not inducing a pregancy, it allowed my obstercian to focus on other possible problems. Overall, Clomid did exactly what it is designed to do - stimulate ovulation. I would recommend its use.
940	levaquin	1	Considerably Effective	Extremely Severe Side Effects	bronchitis	I got much better in a few days.	Started having hallucinations. Began to see dead people (mother, father,siblings) after a few days, couldn't move. just sat in one place staring. A neighbor finally took me to the hospital.

By day 5 I was hospitalized in intensive care.
351	neurontin	8	Highly Effective	No Side Effects	epilepsy, depression and pain	This medication was initially prescribed for pain management and was somewhat effective, but a new neurologist suggested incresing the dose as an addition to the anti-seizure medications that were not completely controlling my epilesy.  This addition finally got the seizures completely under control.	Sometimes I feel a bit nauseated if I take it with my other medications.	As I stated, increasing the dosage of this medication finally got my epilepsy under control.  I was originally prescribed this drug for pain management of a chronic pain problem, but in a lower dose. While I feel that is has only had a minimal effect of lmy pain, the higher dose has gotten my seizures under control.  I also suffer from depression and a panic disorder that may be helped from this drug, but I think that that may be true indirectly, as I think the elimination of the seizures has been the main cause of the relief, particularly the anxiety.

When taking adderall xr 20mg, I had a lot of side effects ranging from dry mouth to aggressive behavior.

Vyvanse 50mg taken once daily in the morning.
